# Short Story Generator using NLP/Language Modelling (WIP)

## Purpose: 
Generate short-stories of several hundred words for children using Natural Language Processing. We will create different models and compare their performance against each other based on technical evaluation criteria (e.g. perplexity) as well as human criteria, such as fluency/grammar, content and creativity. 
Models used:
- n-grams
- GPT-2 (from OpenAI)
- Fine-tuned GPT-2 (finetuned with shortstories scraped from the web) 
This project was part of a group project during the NLP class in the Master of Big Data & Business Analytics at IE University, Madrid. 

**Coding Language:** Python

**Main Libraries used:** 
- huggingface
- fast.ai
- nltk
- Pytorch (Fine-tuning GPT2)
- Keras/Tensorflow


**Colaborators:** 
- Paolo 
- Tinus

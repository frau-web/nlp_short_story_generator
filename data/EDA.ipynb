              "\"THE UGLY DUCKLING. A duck made her nest under some leaves. She sat on the eggs to keep them warm. At last the eggs broke, one after the other. Little ducks came out. Only one egg was left. It was a very large one. At last it broke, and out came a big, ugly duckling. 'What a big duckling!' said the old duck. 'He does not look like us. Can he be a turkey? We will see. If he does not like the water, he is not a duck.' The next day the mother duck took her ducklings to the pond. Splash! Splash! The mother duck was in the water. Then she called the ducklings to come in. They all jumped in and began to swim. The big, ugly duckling swam, too. The mother duck said, 'He is not a turkey. He is my own little duck. He will not be so ugly when he is bigger.' Then she said to the ducklings, 'Come with me. I want you to see the other ducks. Stay by me and look out for the cat.' They all went into the duck yard. What a noise the ducks made! While the mother duck was eating a big bug, an old duck bit the ugly duckling. 'Let him alone,' said the mother duck. 'He did not hurt you.' 'I know that,' said the duck, 'but he is so ugly, I bit him.' The next duck they met, said, 'You have lovely ducklings. They are all pretty but one. He is very ugly.' The mother duck said, 'I know he is not pretty. But he is very good.' Then she said to the ducklings, 'Now, my dears, have a good time.' But the poor, big, ugly duckling did not have a good time. The hens all bit him. The big ducks walked on him. The poor duckling was very sad. He did not want to be so ugly. But he could not help it. He ran to hide under some bushes. The little birds in the bushes were afraid and flew away. 'It is all because I am so ugly,' said the duckling. So he ran away. At night he came to an old house. The house looked as if it would fall down. It was so old. But the wind blew so hard that the duckling went into the house. An old woman lived there with her cat and her hen. The old woman said, 'I will keep the duck. I will have some eggs.' The next day, the cat saw the duckling and began to growl. The hen said, 'Can you lay eggs?' The duckling said, 'No.' 'Then keep still,' said the hen. The cat said, 'Can you growl?' 'No,' said the duckling. 'Then keep still,' said the cat. And the duckling hid in a corner. The next day he went for a walk. He saw a big pond. He said, 'I will have a good swim.' But all of the animals made fun of him. He was so ugly. The summer went by. Then the leaves fell and it was very cold. The poor duckling had a hard time. It is too sad to tell what he did all winter. At last it was spring. The birds sang. The ugly duckling was big now. One day he flew far away. Soon he saw three white swans on the lake. He said, 'I am going to see those birds. I am afraid they will kill me, for I am so ugly.' He put his head down to the water. What did he see? He saw himself in the water. But he was not an ugly duck. He was a white swan. The other swans came to see him. The children said, 'Oh, see the lovely swans. The one that came last is the best.' And they gave him bread and cake. It was a happy time for the ugly duckling. THE LITTLE PINE TREE A little pine tree was in the woods. It had no leaves. It had needles. The little tree said, 'I do not like needles. All the other trees in the woods have pretty leaves. I want leaves, too. But I will have better leaves. I want gold leaves.' Night came and the little tree went to sleep. A fairy came by and gave it gold leaves. When the little tree woke it had leaves of gold. It said, 'Oh, I am so pretty! No other tree has gold leaves.' Night came. A man came by with a bag. He saw the gold leaves. He took them all and put them into his bag. The poor little tree cried, 'I do not want gold leaves again. I will have glass leaves.' So the little tree went to sleep. The fairy came by and put the glass leaves on it. The little tree woke and saw its glass leaves. How pretty they looked in the sunshine! 'No other tree was so bright. Then a wind came up. It blew and blew. The glass leaves all fell from the tree and were broken. Again the little tree had no leaves. It was very sad, and said, 'I will not have gold leaves and I will not have glass leaves. I want green leaves. I want to be like the other trees.' And the little tree went to sleep. When it woke, it was like other trees. It had green leaves. A goat came by. He saw the green leaves on the little tree. The goat was hungry and he ate all the leaves. Then the little tree said, 'I do not want any leaves. I will not have green leaves, nor glass leaves, nor gold leaves. I like my needles best.' And the little tree went to sleep. The fairy gave it what it wanted. When it woke, it had its needles again. Then the little pine tree was happy. THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL. It was very cold. The snow fell and it was almost dark. It was the last day of the year. A little match girl was running in the street. Her name was Gretchen. She had no hat on. Her feet were bare. When she left home, she had on some big slippers of her mama's. But they were so large that she lost them when she ran across the street. Gretchen had a lot of matches in her old apron. She had a little bunch in her hand. But she could not sell her matches. No one would buy them. Poor little Gretchen! She was cold and hungry. The snow fell on her curly hair. But she did not think about that. She saw lights in the houses. She smelled good things cooking. She said to herself, 'This is the last night of the year.' Gretchen got colder and colder. She was afraid to go home. She knew her papa would whip her, if she did not take some money to him. It was as cold at home as in the street. They were too poor to have a fire. They had to put rags in the windows to keep out the wind. Gretchen did not even have a bed. She had to sleep on a pile of rags. She sat down on a door step. Her little hands were almost frozen. She took a match and lighted it to warm her hands. The match looked like a little candle. Gretchen thought she was sitting by a big stove. It was so bright. She put the match near her feet, to warm them. Then the light went out. She did not think that she was by the stove any more. Gretchen lighted another match. Now she thought she could look into a room. In this room was a table. A white cloth and pretty dishes were on the table. There was a roast turkey, too. It was cooked and ready to eat. The knife and fork were in his back. The turkey jumped from the dish and ran to the little girl. The light went out and she was in the cold and dark again. Gretchen lighted another match. Then she thought she was sitting by a Christmas tree. Very many candles were on the tree. It was full of pretty things. Gretchen put up her little hands. The light went out. The lights on the Christmas tree went up, up, until she saw they were the stars. Then she saw a star fall. 'Some one is dying,' said little Gretchen. Her grandma had been very good to the little girl. But she was dead. The grandma had said, 'When a star falls some one is going to God.' The little girl lighted another match. It made a big light. Gretchen thought she saw her grandma. She never looked so pretty before. She looked so sweet and happy. 'O grandma,' said the little girl, 'take me. When the light goes out you will go away. The stove and the turkey and the Christmas tree all went away.' Then Gretchen lighted a bunch of matches. She wanted to keep her grandma with her. The matches made it very light. The grandma took the little girl in her arms. They went up, up, where they would never be cold or hungry. They were with God. The next day came. Some men found a little girl in the street. She was dead. In her hand were the burned matches. They said, 'Poor little thing, she froze to death.' They did not know how happy she was in heaven. LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD. When May was six years old, her grandma made her a red coat with a hood. She looked so pretty in it that the children all called her 'Red Riding-Hood.' One day her mama said, 'I want you to take this cake and some butter to grandma.' Red Riding-Hood was very glad to go. She always had a good time at grandma's. She put the things into her little basket and ran off. When Red Riding-Hood came to the wood, she met a big wolf. 'Where are you going?' said the wolf. Red Riding-Hood said, 'I am going to see my grandma. Mama has made her a cake and some butter.' 'Does she live far?' said the wolf. 'Yes,' said Red Riding-Hood, 'in the white house by the mill.' 'I will go too, and we shall see who will get there first,' said the wolf. The wolf ran off and took a short way, but Red Riding-Hood stopped to pick some flowers. When the wolf got to the house, he tapped on the door. The grandma said, 'Who is there?' The wolf made his voice as soft as he could. He said, 'It is little Red Riding-Hood, grandma.' Then the old lady said, 'Pull the string and the door will open.' The wolf pulled the string and the door opened. He ran in and ate the poor old lady. Then he jumped into her bed and put on her cap. When Red Riding-Hood tapped on the door, the wolf called out, 'Who is there?' Red Riding-Hood said, 'It is your little Red Riding-Hood, grandma.' Then the wolf said, 'Pull the string and the door will open.' When she went in, she said, 'Look, grandma, see the cake and butter mama has sent you.' 'Thank you, dear, put them on the table and come here.' When Red Riding-Hood went near the bed, she said, 'Oh, grandma, how big your arms are!' 'The better to hug you, my dear.' 'How big your ears are, grandma.' 'The better to hear you, my dear.' 'How big your eyes are, grandma.' 'The better to see you, my dear.' 'How big your teeth are, grandma!' 'The better to eat you.' Then the cruel wolf jumped up and ate poor little Red Riding-Hood. Just then a hunter came by. He heard Red Riding-Hood scream. The hunter ran into the house and killed the old wolf. When he cut the wolf open, out jumped Little Red Riding-Hood and her grandma. THE APPLES OF IDUN. Once upon a time three of the gods went on a journey. One was Thor and one was Loki. Loki was ugly and mean. The gods liked to walk over the hills and rocks. They could go very fast for they were so big. The gods walked on and on. At last they got very hungry. Then they came to a field with cattle. Thor killed a big ox and put the pieces into a pot. They made a big fire but the meat would not cook. They made the fire bigger and bigger, but the meat would not cook. Then the gods were very cross. Some one said, 'Give me my share, and I will make the meat cook.' The gods looked to see who was talking. There in an oak tree was a big eagle. The gods were so hungry that they said, 'Well, we will.' The supper was ready in a minute. Then the eagle flew down to get his share. He took the four legs and there was not much left but the ribs. This made Loki cross for he was very hungry. He took a long pole to hit the eagle. But the pole stuck to the eagle's claws. The other end stuck to Loki. Then the eagle flew away. He did not fly high. He flew just high enough for Loki to hit against the stones. Loki said, 'Please let me go! Oh, please let me go!' But the eagle said, 'No, you tried to kill me. I will not let you go.' And the eagle hit him against the stones. Loki said again, 'Please let me go!' But the eagle said, 'No, I have you now.' Then Loki knew the eagle was a giant and not a bird. This giant had a suit of eagle's feathers. He was flying in his eagle suit when he saw Loki. Now the gods lived in a city named Asgard. In this city Idun kept the beautiful golden apples. When the gods felt they were growing old, they ate the apples and were young again. The giant wanted to be like the gods. So he said to Loki, 'I will let you go, if you will get me the apples of Idun.' But Loki said, 'I can't do that.' So the eagle bumped him on the stones again. Then Loki said, 'I can't stand this. I will get the apples for you.' Loki and the eagle went to the city. The eagle stayed by the gate, but Loki went into the city. He went up to Idun. She was putting the apples into a beautiful golden box. Loki said, 'Good morning, Idun Those are beautiful apples.' And Idun said, 'Yes, they are beautiful.' 'I saw some just like them, the other day,' said Loki. Idun knew there were no other apples like these, and she said, 'That is strange. I would like to see them.' Loki said, 'Come with me and I will show them to you. It is only a little way. Bring your apples with you.' As soon as Idun was out of the gates the eagle flew down. He picked her up in his claws. Then he flew away with her to his home. Day after day passed and Idun did not come back. The gods did not have the golden apples to eat, so they began to get old. At last they said, 'Who let the apples go?' Then Loki looked pale and the gods said, 'Loki, you did it.' And Loki said, 'Yes, I did.' He did not tell a story that time. Then Loki said, 'I will get Idun and the apples back, if I may have the falcon suit.' The gods said, 'You may have it, if you will bring the apples back.' Loki put on the falcon suit and flew away. He looked like a big bird flying. When Loki came to the giant's home, he was glad the giant was not there. He changed Idun into a nut and then flew away with the nut. When the giant came home, Idun was gone. The golden apples were gone, too. Then the giant put on his eagle suit and flew after Loki. Loki heard the eagle coming. Loki flew faster. Poor Loki was all out of breath. The eagle flew faster and faster. Then the gods got on the walls to look for Loki. They saw him coming and the eagle after him. So they made fires on the walls. At last Loki flew over the walls. Then the gods lighted the fires. The fires blazed up. The eagle flew into the fire and was burned. As soon as Loki put the nut down, it changed to Idun. The gods ate the beautiful golden apples and were young again. HOW THOR GOT THE HAMMER. Sif was Thor's wife. Sif had long golden hair. Thor was very proud of Sif's golden hair. Thor was always going on long journeys. One day he went off and left Sif alone. She went out on the porch and fell asleep. Loki came along. He was always playing tricks. He saw Sif lying asleep. He said, 'I am going to cut off her hair.' So Loki went up on the porch and cut off Sif's golden hair. When Sif woke up and saw that her hair was gone, she cried and cried. Then she ran to hide. She did not want Thor to see her. When Thor came home, he could not find Sif. 'Sif! Sif!' he called, 'Where are you?' But Sif did not answer. Thor looked all around the house. At last he found her crying. 'Oh, Thor, look, all my hair is gone! Somebody has cut it off. It was a man. He ran away with it.' Then Thor was very angry. He said, 'I know it was Loki. He is always getting into mischief. Just wait until I get him!' And Thor went out to find Loki. Pretty soon he found him. Thor said, 'Did you cut off Sif's hair?' Loki said, 'Yes, I did.' 'Then you must pay for cutting off my wife's hair,' said Thor. 'All right,' said Loki, 'I will get you something better than the hair.' Loki went down, down into the ground to the home of the dwarfs. It was very dark down there. The only light came from the dwarfs' fires. The dwarfs were ugly little black men. They were not any bigger than your thumb. They had crooked backs and crooked legs. Their eyes looked like black beads. Loki said, 'Can you make me a gold crown that will grow like real hair?' The dwarfs said, 'Yes, we can.' So the busy little dwarfs worked all night. When morning came the dwarfs gave Loki his crown of golden hair. They gave him a spear and a ship, too. Loki took the things up to Asgard, where the gods all lived. Then the gods all came up to him. He showed them the things. The gods said, 'They are very wonderful.' And Loki said, 'Oh, nobody else can make such things as my little dwarfs.' A little dwarf, named Brok, was standing near by. He heard Loki say that. Then he stepped up and said, 'My brother can make just as good things as these.' Loki laughed and said, 'If you can get three things as wonderful as these, I will give you my head.' Brok went down into the ground where his little dwarfs were working. Brok's brother was named Sindre. He said to his brother, 'Loki says that you can't make such nice things as his dwarfs can. He said that he would give me his head if I could get him such wonderful things as his.' This made the dwarfs angry. Their eyes grew big. They said, 'He will see what we can do.' Sindre wanted to know what the wonderful things were. Brok said, 'Loki has a golden crown that will grow like real hair. A ship that can go anywhere. A spear that never misses the mark.' 'We will show him,' said the dwarfs. The dwarfs soon had the fires burning. Then Sindre put a pigskin into the fire. He gave the bellows to Brok and said, 'Now blow as hard as you can.' Then Sindre went out. Brok blew and blew. A little fly came in and bit him on the hand. The fly bit him so hard that Brok thought he would have to stop blowing, but he did not. Then Sindre came back. He took out a golden pig from the fire. He next put a lump of gold into the fire. He said to Brok, 'Blow and blow and blow, and do not stop.' Then Sindre went out again. So Brok blew as hard as he could. Then the same fly came in and bit him again. Brok thought that he could not stand it, but he kept on. When Sindre came back, he took a gold ring from the fire. Then Sindre put a lump of iron into the fire. He said to Brok, 'Now blow as hard as you can.' And Sindre went out. Brok blew and blew. The same mean fly came again, and bit him on the forehead. It bit so hard that the blood ran into his eyes. Brok put up his hand to brush away the fly. Just then Sindre came back. He took the hammer out of the fire. 'There!' he said, 'You have almost spoiled it. The handle is too short, but it cannot be helped now.' Brok hurried up to Asgard with his things. All the gods came around to see. Then Loki came up to show his things. He put the crown of gold on Sif's head and it began to grow like real hair. He gave the spear to Odin and said, 'This spear will never miss its mark.' Then he took out the ship. He said, 'This is a wonderful ship. It will sail on any sea, and yet you can fold it up and put it into your pocket.' Loki felt very proud, for he thought his things were the best. All the gods felt very sorry for little Brok. They thought Loki's things were fine. They were afraid Brok's would not be so nice. They said, 'Now, Brok, show your things.' Brok took out the gold ring. He said, 'Each night this ring will throw off a ring just like it. He gave the ring to Odin.' Then Brok took out the golden pig. He said, 'This pig can go anywhere, on the ground or in the air. It can go faster than any horse. If the night is dark, the shining pig will make it light.' Then Brok showed the hammer. He said, 'This is not a very pretty hammer. When I was making it, Loki turned himself into a fly and made me spoil it. The fly bit me so hard that I had to stop blowing. So the handle is a little short. But it is a wonderful hammer. If you throw it at anything, it will hit the mark and come back to you.' The gods picked up the hammer and passed it around. They said, 'It will be just the things with which to keep the Frost Giants out of Asgard.' The gods said, 'Brok's things are the best.' Brok gave the hammer to Thor. That is the way Thor got his wonderful hammer. Then Brok said to Loki, 'You said I could have your head if my things were the best.' And Loki was angry and said, 'Yes, I told you that you could have my head. But you can't touch my neck.' Of course, Brok could not get his head without touching his neck. So Brok did not get Loki's head. THE HAMMER LOST AND FOUND. The Frost Giants did not like the sunshine. They did not like to see the flowers. They did not like to hear the birds sing. They wanted to spoil everything. The Frost Giants wanted to get into Asgard. But they did not know how. They were afraid of Thor and his hammer. They said, 'If we can only get the hammer, we can get into Asgard.' They talked and planned all night. At last one Frost Giant said, 'I know how we can get the hammer. I will dress in a bird suit. Then I will fly up to Thor's house and get the hammer.' The next night the Frost Giant flew into the house while Thor was asleep. He took the hammer and flew away with it. When Thor woke, he put out his hand to get the hammer. It was gone. He said, 'Loki, the hammer is gone. The Frost Giants have taken it. We must get it back.' Loki said, 'I can get it back, if Freyja will let me have her falcon suit.' So he went to Freyja and said, 'Will you let me have your falcon suit? I can get the hammer back if you will.' Freyja said, 'Yes, of course I will. If I had a gold suit you could have it. Any thing to get the hammer back.' Loki took the falcon suit and put it on. He flew over the city. All the people saw him flying. They said, 'What a strange bird!' They did not know that it was Loki going for the hammer. When Loki came to the city of the Frost Giants, he took off the falcon suit. He walked and walked until he came to Thrym's house. Thrym was the giant who took the hammer. Thrym was sitting on the porch, making gold collars for his dogs. When he saw Loki, he said, 'What do you want?' Loki said, 'I have come for the hammer.' The old giant laughed and said, 'You will never get that hammer. It is buried eight miles deep in the ground. 'But there is one way you can get it. I will give you the hammer if you get Freyja for my wife.' So Loki went back to Asgard. Thor said, 'Well, did you get the hammer?' 'No, but we can get it if Freyja will be Thrym's wife.' Then they went to Freyja's house. They said, 'Put on your very best clothes and come with us. You must be Thrym's wife.' Freyja said, 'Do you think I will be the Frost Giant's wife? I won't be his wife.' Thor said, 'We can get the hammer back if you will.' But Freyja said, 'No, I will not be his wife.' Loki said, 'You will have to, if we get the hammer back.' Still Freyja said, 'I will not go.' And she was very angry. She shook so hard that she broke her necklace and it fell to the floor. Then the gods said, 'Thor, you must dress like Freyja. You will have to play you are the bride.' Thor said, 'I won't do it. You will all laugh at me. I won't dress up like a girl.' They said, 'Well, that is the only way we can get the hammer back.' Thor said, 'I do not like to dress like a girl, but I will do it.' Then they dressed Thor up like Freyja. They put on Freyja's dress, necklace and vail, and braided his hair. Loki said, 'I will dress up too, and be your servant.' They got into Thor's goat wagon and went to the Giants' home. When the Frost Giants saw them coming, they said, 'Get ready, here comes the bride! We will sit down to the table as soon as they come.' The dinner was ready on time. The table was full of good things. All sat down. The bride ate a whole ox and eight salmon before the others had a bite. 'She must be very hungry,' the Frost Giants said. 'Yes,' Loki said, 'she was so glad to come. She hasn't eaten anything for eight days.' Then they brought in the mead. The bride drank three barrels of mead. 'How thirsty she is!' said the Frost Giants. Loki said, 'Yes, she is very thirsty. She was so glad to come. She did not drink anything for eight days.' Old Thrym said, 'I had every thing I wanted but Freyja. Now I have Freyja.' And Thrym went to kiss the bride. He lifted her vail, but her eyes shone like fire. Thrym stepped back. He said, 'What makes Freyja's eyes shine so?' Loki said, 'Oh, she was so glad to come. She did not sleep for eight nights.' Then Loki said, 'It is time for the hammer. Go and get it and put it in the bride's lap.' As soon as the hammer was in his lap, Thor tore off the vail. He took the hammer and whirled it around. Fire flew from it. The fire burned the house and the Frost Giants ran away. So Thor got his hammer back. The following stories by Miss Smythe were originally published under the title of 'The Golden Fleece.' They have been carefully revised and illustrated for this book. THE STORY OF THE SHEEP. Long, long ago there lived a king in Greece. He had two little children, a boy and a girl. They were good children and loved each other very much. One day they were playing in the garden. 'Oh, Helle, look!' said the boy. There on the grass was a fine large sheep. This sheep had a fleece of gold and his horns were gold, too. us Every day they played in the garden and every day the sheep came, too. By and by he grew tame and let the children pat his golden fleece. One day the boy said, 'Helle, let us take a ride.' First he helped his sister on the sheep's back. Then he got on and held to the horns. 'Hold tight to me, Helle,' he said. The sheep went up, up into the sky, and ran a long way on the clouds. But Helle got dizzy and fell down into the sea. The boy felt very bad to lose his sister, but went right on. Then he came to the land Colchis. He killed the sheep and gave the golden fleece to the king. The king was glad to have it and nailed it to an oak tree. By the tree was a dragon. The dragon never went to sleep. He would not let any one but the king come to the tree. So no one could get the golden fleece. THE GOOD SHIP ARGO.                                                                                                                                                            Jason was a brave young man. He lived a little way from the king's city. One day the king gave a big party and invited Jason. It was a very dark night and it rained hard. Jason had to go across a creek, but there was no bridge. The creek was full of water and Jason had to wade. One of his shoe-strings came untied and he lost his shoe in the water. When he came to the king's house, he had but one shoe. The king did not like this, for a fairy had said, 'The man who shall come to your house with one shoe, will be king.' So he knew Jason was to be king. Then he said to Jason, 'You may be king when you bring me the golden fleece.' Jason was glad to go, and asked many brave men to go with him. To get the golden fleece they would have to fight wild men and animals. They made a big ship which they named 'Argo.' The men who went on the Argo were called Argonauts. The ship Argo sailed a long way. There were two strong men on the ship. They had wings and could fly. One day the Argo came to a land where the blind king lived. This poor king had a hard time. When he sat down to the table to eat, some ugly birds called Harpies, came too. The Harpies had skin like brass and nobody could hurt them. They had claws of iron, and scratched people when they tried to drive them away. When the king's dinner was ready, the Harpies came and took it away. When Jason and his men came, the king told them all about it. Jason said they would help him. They all sat down to the table. When the food was put on the table, the Harpies came flying in. Jason and his men took their swords. They cut at the Harpies but could not hurt them. Then the two men with wings flew up in the air. The Harpies were afraid and flew away. The men flew after them. At last the Harpies grew very tired and fell into the sea and were drowned. Then the men with wings came back. Now the blind king could eat all he wanted. It was now time for Jason and his friends to go away. The king thanked them over and over again for helping him. When they said good-bye, he told them how to get to the land where they would find the golden fleece. On the sea where Jason and his men had to sail, were two big rocks. These rocks moved on the waterlike icebergs. They were as high as a big hill. They would come close to each other, then they would go far apart. When fishes swam in the water the rocks would come together and kill the fishes. If birds flew in the air, the rocks would come together and kill birds. If a boat sailed on the water, the rocks would come together and break the boat into little pieces. These rocks had been put in the sea, so no one could go to the land where the golden fleece was. When the ship Argo came to the rocks, Jason sent a dove out. The rocks came together when the dove was almost past. Then they went far apart. Jason made his men row as hard as they could. The rocks began to come together. 'Row hard, my men,' said Jason. Just as they got past, the rocks hit, but Jason and his men were all right. So they came to Colchis. When Jason came to Colchis, he went to the king and said, 'Will you give me the golden fleece?' The king wanted to keep the fleece. So he said to Jason, 'You may have it, but you must do something for me first.' 'You must plow with the brass bulls, and plant the dragon's teeth.' The brass bulls looked like real bulls, but they were larger and stronger. They blew out fire and smoke from their noses and mouths. The bulls had a stall made of iron and stone. They had to be tied with strong iron chains. When the dragon's teeth were planted, iron men grew up. They always killed the one who had planted them. The king wanted the bulls to kill Jason. He said, 'If the bulls do not kill him the iron men will.' The king had a daughter named Medea. She saw Jason was a brave young man and did not want him killed. She knew how to help him. She stepped into her carriage, which was pulled by flying snakes. Then Medea flew through the air. She went to hills and creeks and picked all kinds of flowers. She took the flowers home and cooked them. Then Medea went to Jason when the king did not know it. She said to Jason, 'Rub your face and hands and legs with this juice.' When he did this, he was as strong as a giant. Nothing could hurt him then. Fire could not burn him, and swords could not cut him. The next day Jason had to plow with the brass bulls and plant the dragon's teeth. Early in the morning, the king and princess went out to the place. They had good seats where they could see well. All the people in the city came out to see Jason plow. The little boys climbed the trees so they could see better. Then Jason came to the place. The stall where the brass bulls were tied was not far off. The door was opened and Jason went in. He untied the bulls and took hold of their horns. Then he made the bulls come out of their stall. The bulls were very angry and blew fire and smoke from their mouths. This made the cruel king glad. But the people who saw it were afraid. They did not want Jason killed. They did not know that the princess had helped him. Jason pushed the bulls' heads down to the ground. Then they kicked at him with their feet, but could not hurt him. He held their heads down on the ground until the plow was ready. Jason took the chains in one hand. He took the handle of the plow in the other. The bulls jumped and wanted to run away. But Jason held so hard they had to go very slowly. When it was noon the ground was all plowed. Then Jason let the bulls go. They were so angry that they ran away to the woods. Now Jason went to the king and said, 'Give me the dragon's teeth.' The king gave him his hat full. Then Jason planted the dragon's teeth, just as a man plants wheat. By this time he was very tired, so he went to lie down. In the evening he came back. The iron men were growing up. Some of the men had only their feet in the ground. Some of them were in the ground up to their knees. Some had only their heads out. They all tried to get out so they could kill Jason. Then Jason did what Medea told him he should do. He took a giant's marble and threw it near the men. All the iron men wanted to get the marble. So they began to fight each other. As soon as one had his feet out of the ground, he cut at the man next to him. So they killed each other. Then Jason took his sword and cut off all the heads that were out of the ground. So all the iron men were killed and the king was very angry. But Medea and the people were glad. JASON AND THE DRAGON. The next day Jason went to the king and said, 'Now, give me the golden fleece.' The king did not give it to him, but said, 'Come again.' Then Medea said, 'If you want the golden fleece, you must help yourself. My father will not give it to you. A dragon is by the tree where the golden fleece is, and he never sleeps. He is always hungry and eats people if they go near him. I can not kill him but I can make him sleep. He is very fond of cake. I will make some cake and put in something to make the dragon sleep.' So Medea made the cakes and Jason took them and threw them to the dragon. The dragon ate them all and went to sleep. Then Jason climbed over the dragon and took the nail out of the tree. He put the golden fleece under his coat and ran to the ship Argo. Medea went with him and became his wife. Oh, how angry the king was! He had lost the golden fleece and the brass bulls and the dragon's teeth. And now his daughter was gone. He sent his men in ships to take Jason, but they could not get him. At last Medea and Jason and the other Argonauts came to Greece. Jason's father was there. He was a very old man. Jason wanted his father to be king, so he asked Medea to make the old man young. Then Medea took her carriage and flew through the air. She did not come back for nine days. She picked flowers from the hills. She found all kinds of stones, too. When she went home she put all these things into a pot and cooked them. Then she put a stick into the pot and leaves grew on it. Some of the juice fell on the ground and grass grew up. So Medea knew the juice would make things grow. Jason's father went to sleep and Medea put some of the juice into his mouth. His white hair turned black and teeth grew in his mouth. When he woke up, he looked and felt like a young man. He lived many years and when he died Jason was king. Once upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names were           Flopsy,        Mopsy,    Cotton-tail, and Peter. They lived with their Mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir-tree. 'Now my dears,' said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, 'you may go into the fields or down the lane, but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden: your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor.' 'Now run along, and don't get into mischief. I am going out.' Then old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, and went through the wood to the baker's. She bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns. Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail, who were good little bunnies, went down the lane to gather blackberries: But Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor's garden, and squeezed under the gate! First he ate some lettuces and some French beans; and then he ate some radishes; And then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley. But round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor! Mr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, 'Stop thief!' Peter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate. He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe amongst the potatoes. After losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket. It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new. Peter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself. Mr. McGregor came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top of Peter; but Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind him. And rushed into the tool-shed, and jumped into a can. It would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it. Mr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the tool-shed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot. He began to turn them over carefully, looking under each. Presently Peter sneezed, 'Kertyschoo!' Mr. McGregor was after him in no time. And tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants. The window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and he was tired of running after Peter. He went back to his work. Peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go. Also he was very damp with sitting in that can. After a time he began to wander about, going lippity lippity not very fast, and looking all round. He found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath. An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood. Peter asked her the way to the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer. She only shook her head at him. Peter began to cry. Then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled. Presently, he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled his water-cans. A white cat was staring at some gold-fish, she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive. Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her; he had heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny. He went back towards the tool-shed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe, scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch. Peter scuttered underneath the bushes. But presently, as nothing happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow and peeped over. The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions. His back was turned towards Peter, and beyond him was the gate! Peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow; and started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black-currant bushes. Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not care. He slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden. Mr. McGregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow to frighten the blackbirds. Peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir-tree. He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit-hole and shut his eyes. His mother was busy cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes. It was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight! I am sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening. His mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea; and she gave a dose of it to Peter! 'One table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time.' But Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail had bread and milk and blackberries for supper. THE END Once upon a time there were three little kittens, and their names were Mittens, Tom Kitten, and Moppet. They had dear little fur coats of their own; and they tumbled about the doorstep and played in the dust. But one day their mother, Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit, expected friends to tea; so she fetched the kittens indoors, to wash and dress them, before the fine company arrived. First she scrubbed their faces (this one is Moppet). Then she brushed their fur, (this one is Mittens). Then she combed their tails and whiskers (this is Tom Kitten). Tom was very naughty, and he scratched. Mrs. Tabitha dressed Moppet and Mittens in clean pinafores and tuckers; and then she took all sorts of elegant uncomfortable clothes out of a chest of drawers, in order to dress up her son Thomas. Tom Kitten was very fat, and he had grown; several buttons burst off. His mother sewed them on again. When the three kittens were ready, Mrs. Tabitha unwisely turned them out into the garden, to be out of the way while she made hot buttered toast. 'Now keep your frocks clean, children! You must walk on your hind legs. Keep away from the dirty ash-pit, and from Sally Henny Penny, and from the pig-stye and the Puddle-Ducks.' Moppet and Mittens walked down the garden path unsteadily. Presently they trod upon their pinafores and fell on their noses. When they stood up there were several green smears! 'Let us climb up the rockery, and sit on the garden wall,' said Moppet. They turned their pinafores back to front, and went up with a skip and a jump; Moppet's white tucker fell down into the road. Tom Kitten was quite unable to jump when walking upon his hind legs in trousers. He came up the rockery by degrees, breaking the ferns, and shedding buttons right and left. He was all in pieces when he reached the top of the wall. Moppet and Mittens tried to pull him together; his hat fell off, and the rest of his buttons burst. While they were in difficulties, there was a pit pat paddle pat! and the three Puddle-Ducks came along the hard high road, marching one behind the other and doing the goose step, pit pat paddle pat! pit pat waddle pat! They stopped and stood in a row, and stared up at the kittens. They had very small eyes and looked surprised. Then the two duck-birds, Rebeccah and Jemima Puddle-Duck, picked up the hat and tucker and put them on. Mittens laughed so that she fell off the wall. Moppet and Tom descended after her; the pinafores and all the rest of Tom's clothes came off on the way down. 'Come! Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck,' said Moppet 'Come and help us to dress him! Come and button up Tom!' Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck advanced in a slow sideways manner, and picked up the various articles. But he put them on himself! They fitted him even worse than Tom Kitten. 'It's a very fine morning!' said Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck. And he and Jemima and Rebeccah Puddle-Duck set off up the road, keeping step, pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat! Then Tabitha Twitchit came down the garden and found her kittens on the wall with no clothes on. She pulled them off the wall, smacked them, and took them back to the house. 'My friends will arrive in a minute, and you are not fit to be seen; I am affronted,' said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit. She sent them upstairs; and I am sorry to say she told her friends that they were in bed with the measles; which was not true. Quite the contrary; they were not in bed: not in the least. Somehow there were very extraordinary noises over-head, which disturbed the dignity and repose of the tea party. And I think that some day I shall have to make another, larger, book, to tell you more about Tom Kitten! As for the Puddle-Ducks, they went into a pond. The clothes all came off directly, because there were no buttons. And Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck, and Jemima and Rebeccah, have been looking for them ever since. This is a Tale about a tail, a tail that belonged to a little red squirrel, and his name was Nutkin. He had a brother called Twinkleberry, and a great many cousins: they lived in a wood at the edge of a lake. In the middle of the lake there is an island covered with trees and nut bushes; and amongst those trees stands a hollow oak-tree, which is the house of an owl who is called Old Brown. One autumn when the nuts were ripe, and the leaves on the hazel bushes were golden and green. Nutkin and Twinkleberry and all the other little squirrels came out of the wood, and down to the edge of the lake. They made little rafts out of twigs, and they paddled away over the water to Owl Island to gather nuts. Each squirrel had a little sack and a large oar, and spread out his tail for a sail. They also took with them an offering of three fat mice as a present for Old Brown, and put them down upon his door-step. Then Twinkleberry and the other little squirrels each made a low bow, and said politely 'Old Mr. Brown, will you favour us with permission to gather nuts upon your island?' But Nutkin was excessively impertinent in his manners. He bobbed up and down like a little red cherry, singing 'Riddle me, riddle me, rot-tot-tote!  A little wee man, in a red red coat!A staff in his hand, and a stone in his throat;  If you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a groat.' Now this riddle is as old as the hills; Mr. Brown paid no attention whatever to Nutkin. He shut his eyes obstinately and went to sleep. The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts, and sailed away home in the evening. But next morning they all came back again to Owl Island; and Twinkleberry and the others brought a fine fat mole, and laid it on the stone in front of Old Brown's doorway, and said 'Mr. Brown, will you favour us with your gracious permission to gather some more nuts?' But Nutkin, who had no respect, began to dance up and down, tickling old Mr. Brown with a nettle and singing 'Old Mr. B! Riddle-me-ree! Hitty Pitty within the wall,  Hitty Pitty without the wall; If you touch Hitty Pitty, Hitty Pitty will bite you!' Mr. Brown woke up suddenly and carried the mole into his house. He shut the door in Nutkin's face. Presently a little thread of blue smoke from a wood fire came up from the top of the tree, and Nutkin peeped through the key-hole and sang 'A house full, a hole full!  And you cannot gather a bowl-full!' The squirrels searched for nuts all over the island and filled their little sacks. But Nutkin gathered oak-apples, yellow and scarlet, and sat upon a beech-stump playing marbles, and watching the door of old Mr. Brown. On the third day the squirrels got up very early and went fishing; they caught seven fat minnows as a present for Old Brown. They paddled over the lake and landed under a crooked chestnut tree on Owl Island. Twinkleberry and six other little squirrels each carried a fat minnow; but Nutkin, who had no nice manners, brought no present at all. He ran in front, singing 'The man in the wilderness said to me, 'How many strawberries grow in the sea?' I answered him as I thought good,'As many red herrings as grow in the wood.'' But old Mr. Brown took no interest in riddles, not even when the answer was provided for him. On the fourth day the squirrels brought a present of six fat beetles, which were as good as plums in plum-pudding for Old Brown. Each beetle was wrapped up carefully in a dock-leaf, fastened with a pine-needle pin. But Nutkin sang as rudely as ever 'Old Mr. B! riddle-me-ree flour of England, fruit of Spain, met together in a shower of rain; put in a bag tied round with a string, if you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a ring!' Which was ridiculous of Nutkin, because he had not got any ring to give to Old Brown. The other squirrels hunted up and down the nut bushes; but Nutkin gathered robin's pincushions off a briar bush, and stuck them full of pine-needle pins. On the fifth day the squirrels brought a present of wild honey; it was so sweet and sticky that they licked their fingers as they put it down upon the stone. They had stolen it out of a bumble bees' nest on the tippitty top of the hill. But Nutkin skipped up and down, singing 'Hum-a-bum! buzz! buzz! Hum-a-bum buzz!  As I went over Tipple-tine I met a flock of bonny swine; some yellow-nacked, some yellow backed! They were the very bonniest swine that e'er went over Tipple-tine.' Old Mr. Brown turned up his eyes in disgust at the impertinence of Nutkin. But he ate up the honey! The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts. But Nutkin sat upon a big flat rock, and played ninepins with a crab apple and green fir-cones. On the sixth day, which was Saturday, the squirrels came again for the last time; they brought a new-laid egg in a little rush basket as a last parting present for Old Brown. But Nutkin ran in front laughing, and shouting 'Humpty Dumpty lies in the beck,  with a white counterpane round his neck, forty doctors and forty wrights, cannot put Humpty Dumpty to rights!' Now old Mr. Brown took an interest in eggs; he opened one eye and shut it again. But still he did not speak. Nutkin became more and more impertinent 'Old Mr. B! Old Mr. B! Hickamore, Hackamore,  on the King's kitchen door; All the King's horses, and all the King's men,  couldn't drive Hickamore, Hackamore, off the King's kitchen door.' Nutkin danced up and down like a sunbeam; but still Old Brown said nothing at all. Nutkin began again 'Arthur O'Bower has broken his band, he comes roaring up the land! The King of Scots with all his power, cannot turn Arthur of the Bower!' Nutkin made a whirring noise to sound like the wind, and he took a running jump right onto the head of Old Brown!... Then all at once there was a flutterment and a scufflement and a loud 'Squeak!' The other squirrels scuttered away into the bushes. When they came back very cautiously, peeping round the tree,there was Old Brown sitting on his door-step, quite still, with his eyes closed, as if nothing had happened. But Nutkin was in his waistcoat pocket! This looks like the end of the story; but it isn't. Old Brown carried Nutkin into his house, and held him up by the tail, intending to skin him; but Nutkin pulled so very hard that his tail broke in two, and he dashed up the staircase and escaped out of the attic window. And to this day, if you meet Nutkin up a tree and ask him a riddle, he will throw sticks at you, and stamp his feet and scold, and shout 'Cuck-cuck-cuck-cur-r-r-cuck-k-k!' THE END STRUWWELPETER Merry Stories and Funny Pictures     When the children have been good,     That is, be it understood,     Good at meal-times, good at play,     Good all night and good all day     They shall have the pretty things     Merry Christmas always brings.     Naughty, romping girls and boys     Tear their clothes and make a noise,     Spoil their pinafores and frocks,     And deserve no Christmas-box.     Such as these shall never look     At this pretty Picture-book. Shock-headed Peter     Just look at him! there he stands,     With his nasty hair and hands.     See! his nails are never cut;     They are grimed as black as soot;     And the sloven, I declare,     Never once has combed his hair;     Anything to me is sweeter     Than to see Shock-headed Peter. Cruel Frederick     Here is cruel Frederick, see!     A horrid wicked boy was he;     He caught the flies, poor little things,     And then tore off their tiny wings,     He killed the birds, and broke the chairs,     And threw the kitten down the stairs;     And oh! far worse than all beside,     He whipped his Mary, till she cried.     The trough was full, and faithful Tray     Came out to drink one sultry day;     He wagged his tail, and wet his lip,     When cruel Fred snatched up a whip,     And whipped poor Tray till he was sore,     And kicked and whipped him more and more:     At this, good Tray grew very red,     And growled, and bit him till he bled;     Then you should only have been by,     To see how Fred did scream and cry!     So Frederick had to go to bed:     His leg was very sore and red!     The Doctor came, and shook his head,     And made a very great to-do,     And gave him nasty physic too.     But good dog Tray is happy now;     He has no time to say 'Bow-wow!'     He seats himself in Frederick's chair     And laughs to see the nice things there:     The soup he swallows, sup by sup     And eats the pies and puddings up. The Dreadful Story of Harriet and the Matches     It almost makes me cry to tell     What foolish Harriet befell.     Mamma and Nurse went out one day     And left her all alone at play.     Now, on the table close at hand,     A box of matches chanced to stand;     And kind Mamma and Nurse had told her,     That, if she touched them, they would scold her.     But Harriet said: 'Oh, what a pity!     For, when they burn, it is so pretty;     They crackle so, and spit, and flame:     Mamma, too, often does the same.'     The pussy-cats heard this,     And they began to hiss,     And stretch their claws,     And raise their paws;     'Me-ow,' they said, 'me-ow, me-o,     You'll burn to death, if you do so.'     But Harriet would not take advice:     She lit a match, it was so nice!     It crackled so, it burned so clear     Exactly like the picture here.     She jumped for joy and ran about     And was too pleased to put it out.     The Pussy-cats saw this     And said: 'Oh, naughty, naughty Miss!'     And stretched their claws,     And raised their paws:     ''Tis very, very wrong, you know,     Me-ow, me-o, me-ow, me-o,     You will be burnt, if you do so.'     And see! oh, what dreadful thing!     The fire has caught her apron-string;     Her apron burns, her arms, her hair     She burns all over everywhere.     Then how the pussy-cats did mew     What else, poor pussies, could they do?     They screamed for help, 'twas all in vain!     So then they said: 'We'll scream again;     Make haste, make haste, me-ow, me-o,     She'll burn to death; we told her so.'     So she was burnt, with all her clothes,     And arms, and hands, and eyes, and nose;     Till she had nothing more to lose     Except her little scarlet shoes;     And nothing else but these was found     Among her ashes on the ground.     And when the good cats sat beside     The smoking ashes, how they cried!     'Me-ow, me-oo, me-ow, me-oo,     What will Mamma and Nursey do?'     Their tears ran down their cheeks so fast,     They made a little pond at last. The Story of the Inky Boys     As he had often done before,     The woolly-headed Black-a-moor     One nice fine summer's day went out     To see the shops, and walk about;     And, as he found it hot, poor fellow,     He took with him his green umbrella,     Then Edward, little noisy wag,     Ran out and laughed, and waved his flag;     And William came in jacket trim,     And brought his wooden hoop with him;     And Arthur, too, snatched up his toys     And joined the other naughty boys.     So, one and all set up a roar,     And laughed and hooted more and more,     And kept on singing, only think!     'Oh, Blacky, you're as black as ink!'     Now tall Agrippa lived close by     So tall, he almost touched the sky;     He had a mighty inkstand, too,     In which a great goose-feather grew;     He called out in an angry tone     'Boys, leave the Black-a-moor alone!     For, if he tries with all his might,     He cannot change from black to white.'     But, ah! they did not mind a bit     What great Agrippa said of it;     But went on laughing, as before,     And hooting at the Black-a-moor.     Then great Agrippa foams with rage     Look at him on this very page!     He seizes Arthur, seizes Ned,     Takes William by his little head;     And they may scream and kick and call,     Into the ink he dips them all;     Into the inkstand, one, two, three,     Till they are black as black can be;     Turn over now, and you shall see.     See, there they are, and there they run!     The Black-a-moor enjoys the fun.     They have been made as black as crows,     Quite black all over, eyes and nose,     And legs, and arms, and heads, and toes,     And trousers, pinafores, and toys     The silly little inky boys!     Because they set up such a roar,     And teased the harmless Black-a-moor. The Story of the Man that went out Shooting     This is the man that shoots the hares;     This is the coat he always wears:     With game-bag, powder-horn, and gun     He's going out to have some fun.     He finds it hard, without a pair     Of spectacles, to shoot the hare.     The hare sits snug in leaves and grass,     And laughs to see the green man pass.     Now, as the sun grew very hot,     And he a heavy gun had got,     He lay down underneath a tree     And went to sleep, as you may see.     And, while he slept like any top,     The little hare came, hop, hop, hop,     Took gun and spectacles, and then     On her hind legs went off again.     The green man wakes and sees her place     The spectacles upon her face;     And now she's trying all she can     To shoot the sleepy, green-coat man.     He cries and screams and runs away;     The hare runs after him all day     And hears him call out everywhere:     'Help! Fire! Help! The Hare! The Hare!'     At last he stumbled at the well,     Head over ears, and in he fell.     The hare stopped short, took aim and, hark!     Bang went the gun she missed her mark!     The poor man's wife was drinking up     Her coffee in her coffee-cup;     The gun shot cup and saucer through;     'Oh dear!' cried she; 'what shall I do?'     There lived close by the cottage there     The hare's own child, the little hare;     And while she stood upon her toes,     The coffee fell and burned her nose.     'Oh dear!' she cried, with spoon in hand,     'Such fun I do not understand.' The Story of Little Suck-a-Thumb     One day Mamma said 'Conrad dear,     I must go out and leave you here.     But mind now, Conrad, what I say,     Don't suck your thumb while I'm away.     The great tall tailor always comes     To little boys who suck their thumbs;     And ere they dream what he's about,     He takes his great sharp scissors out,     And cuts their thumbs clean off and then,     You know, they never grow again.'     Mamma had scarcely turned her back,     The thumb was in, Alack! Alack!     The door flew open, in he ran,     The great, long, red-legged scissor-man.     Oh! children, see! the tailor's come     And caught out little Suck-a-Thumb.     Snip! Snap! Snip! the scissors go;     And Conrad cries out 'Oh! Oh! Oh!'     Snip! Snap! Snip! They go so fast,     That both his thumbs are off at last.     Mamma comes home: there Conrad stands,     And looks quite sad, and shows his hands;     'Ah!' said Mamma, 'I knew he'd come     To naughty little Suck-a-Thumb.' The Story of Augustus who would not have any Soup     Augustus was a chubby lad;     Fat ruddy cheeks Augustus had:     And everybody saw with joy     The plump and hearty, healthy boy.     He ate and drank as he was told,     And never let his soup get cold.     But one day, one cold winter's day,     He screamed out 'Take the soup away!     O take the nasty soup away!     I won't have any soup today.'     Next day, now look, the picture shows     How lank and lean Augustus grows!     Yet, though he feels so weak and ill,     The naughty fellow cries out still     'Not any soup for me, I say:     O take the nasty soup away!     I won't have any soup today.'     The third day comes: Oh what a sin!     To make himself so pale and thin.     Yet, when the soup is put on table,     He screams, as loud as he is able,     'Not any soup for me, I say:     O take the nasty soup away!     I WON'T have any soup today.'     Look at him, now the fourth day's come!     He scarcely weighs a sugar-plum;     He's like a little bit of thread,     And, on the fifth day, he was dead! The Story of Fidgety Philip     'Let me see if Philip can     Be a little gentleman;     Let me see if he is able     To sit still for once at table':     Thus Papa bade Phil behave;     And Mamma looked very grave.     But fidgety Phil,     He won't sit still;     He wriggles,     And giggles,     And then, I declare,     Swings backwards and forwards,     And tilts up his chair,     Just like any rocking horse     'Philip! I am getting cross!'     See the naughty, restless child     Growing still more rude and wild,     Till his chair falls over quite.     Philip screams with all his might,     Catches at the cloth, but then     That makes matters worse again.     Down upon the ground they fall,     Glasses, plates, knives, forks, and all.     How Mamma did fret and frown,     When she saw them tumbling down!     And Papa made such a face!     Philip is in sad disgrace.     Where is Philip, where is he?     Fairly covered up you see!     Cloth and all are lying on him;     He has pulled down all upon him.     What a terrible to-do!     Dishes, glasses, snapt in two!     Here a knife, and there a fork!     Philip, this is cruel work.     Table all so bare, and ah!     Poor Papa, and poor Mamma     Look quite cross, and wonder how     They shall have their dinner now. The Story of Johnny Head-in-Air     As he trudged along to school,     It was always Johnny's rule     To be looking at the sky     And the clouds that floated by;     But what just before him lay,     In his way,     Johnny never thought about;     So that every one cried out     'Look at little Johnny there,     Little Johnny Head-In-Air!'     Running just in Johnny's way     Came a little dog one day;     Johnny's eyes were still astray     Up on high,     In the sky;     And he never heard them cry     'Johnny, mind, the dog is nigh!'     Bump!     Dump!     Down they fell, with such a thump,     Dog and Johnny in a lump!     Once, with head as high as ever,     Johnny walked beside the river.     Johnny watched the swallows trying     Which was cleverest at flying.     Oh! what fun!     Johnny watched the bright round sun     Going in and coming out;     This was all he thought about.     So he strode on, only think!     To the river's very brink,     Where the bank was high and steep,     And the water very deep;     And the fishes, in a row,     Stared to see him coming so.     One step more! oh! sad to tell!     Headlong in poor Johnny fell.     And the fishes, in dismay,     Wagged their tails and swam away.     There lay Johnny on his face,     With his nice red writing-case;     But, as they were passing by,     Two strong men had heard him cry;     And, with sticks, these two strong men     Hooked poor Johnny out again.     Oh! you should have seen him shiver     When they pulled him from the river.     He was in a sorry plight!     Dripping wet, and such a fright!     Wet all over, everywhere,     Clothes, and arms, and face, and hair:     Johnny never will forget     What it is to be so wet.     And the fishes, one, two, three,     Are come back again, you see;     Up they came the moment after,     To enjoy the fun and laughter.     Each popped out his little head,     And, to tease poor Johnny, said     'Silly little Johnny, look,     You have lost your writing-book!' The Story of Flying Robert     When the rain comes tumbling down     In the country or the town,     All good little girls and boys     Stay at home and mind their toys.     Robert thought, 'No, when it pours,     It is better out of doors.'     Rain it did, and in a minute     Bob was in it.     Here you see him, silly fellow,     Underneath his red umbrella.     What a wind! oh! how it whistles     Through the trees and flowers and thistles!     It has caught his red umbrella:     Now look at him, silly fellow,     Up he flies     To the skies.     No one heard his screams and cries;     Through the clouds the rude wind bore him,     And his hat flew on before him.     Soon they got to such a height,     They were nearly out of sight.     And the hat went up so high,     That it nearly touched the sky.     No one ever yet could tell     Where they stopped, or where they fell:     Only this one thing is plain,     Bob was never seen again! THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS. Once upon a time there was an old Sow with three little Pigs, and as she had not enough to keep them, she sent them out to seek their fortune. The first that went off met a Man with a bundle of straw, and said to him, 'Please, Man, give me that straw to build me a house'; which the Man did, and the little Pig built a house with it. Presently came along a Wolf, and knocked at the door, and said, 'Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in.' To which the Pig answered, 'No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin.' 'Then I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in!' said the Wolf. So he huffed and he puffed, and he blew his house in, and ate up the little Pig. The second Pig met a Man with a bundle of furze, and said, 'Please, Man, give me that furze to build a house'; which the Man did, and the Pig built his house. Then along came the Wolf and said, 'Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in.' 'No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin.' 'Then I'll puff and I'll huff, and I'll blow your house in!' So he huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and he huffed, and at last he blew the house down, and ate up the second little Pig. The third little Pig met a Man with a load of bricks, and said, 'Please, Man, give me those bricks to build a house with'; so the Man gave him the bricks, and he built his house with them. So the Wolf came, as he did to the other little Pigs, and said, 'Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in.' 'No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin.' 'Then I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in.' Well, he huffed and he puffed, and he huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and he huffed; but he could not get the house down. When he found that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the house down, he said, 'Little Pig, I know where there is a nice field of turnips.' 'Where?' said the little Pig. 'Oh, in Mr. Smith's home-field; and if you will be ready to-morrow morning, I will call for you, and we will go together and get some for dinner.' 'Very well,' said the little Pig, 'I will be ready. What time do you mean to go?' 'Oh, at six o'clock.' Well, the little Pig got up at five, and got the turnips and was home again before six. When the Wolf came he said, 'Little Pig, are you ready?' 'Ready!' said the little Pig, 'I have been and come back again, and got a nice pot-full for dinner.' The Wolf felt very angry at this, but thought that he would be up to the little Pig somehow or other; so he said, 'Little Pig, I know where there is a nice apple-tree.' 'Where?' said the Pig. 'Down at Merry-garden,' replied the Wolf; 'and if you will not deceive me I will come for you, at five o'clock to-morrow, and we will go together and get some apples.' Well, the little Pig woke at four the next morning, and bustled up, and went off for the apples, hoping to get back before the Wolf came; but he had farther to go, and had to climb the tree, so that just as he was coming down from it, he saw the Wolf coming, which, as you may suppose, frightened him very much. When the Wolf came up he said, 'Little Pig, what! are you here before me? Are they nice apples?' 'Yes, very,' said the little Pig; 'I will throw you down one.' And he threw it so far that, while the Wolf was gone to pick it up, the little Pig jumped down and ran home. The next day the Wolf came again, and said to the little Pig, 'Little Pig, there is a Fair in the Town this afternoon: will you go?' 'Oh, yes,' said the Pig, 'I will go; what time shall you be ready?' 'At three,' said the Wolf. So the little Pig went off before the time, as usual, and got to the Fair, and bought a butter churn, and was on his way home with it when he saw the Wolf coming. Then he could not tell what to do. So he got into the churn to hide, and in doing so turned it round, and it began to roll, and rolled down the hill with the Pig inside it, which frightened the Wolf so much that he ran home without going to the Fair. He went to the little Pig's house, and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came down the hill past him. Then the little Pig said, 'Hah! I frightened you, did I? I had been to the Fair and bought a butter churn, and when I saw you I got into it, and rolled down the hill.' Then the Wolf was very angry indeed, and declared he would eat up the little Pig, and that he would get down the chimney afer him. When the little Pig saw what he was about, he hung on the pot full of water, and made up a blazing fire, and, just as the Wolf was coming down, took off the cover of the pot, and in fell the Wolf. And the little Pig put on the cover again in an instant, boiled him up, and ate him for supper, and lived happy ever after. THE REAL LITTLE LUCIE OF NEWLANDS Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lucie, who lived at a farm called Little-town. She was a good little girl, only she was always losing her pocket-handkerchiefs! One day little Lucie came into the farm-yard crying, oh, she did cry so! 'I've lost my pocket-handkin! Three handkins and a pinny! Have you seen them, Tabby Kitten?' The Kitten went on washing her white paws; so Lucie asked a speckled hen 'Sally Henny-penny, have you found three pocket-handkins?' But the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking 'I go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!' And then Lucie asked Cock Robin sitting on a twig. Cock Robin looked sideways at Lucie with his bright black eye, and he flew over a stile and away. Lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind Little-town, a hill that goes up, up, into the clouds as though it had no top! And a great way up the hill-side she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass. Lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her; she ran along a steep path-way, up and up, until Little-town was right away down below, she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney! Presently she came to a spring, bubbling out from the hill-side. Some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water, but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg-cup! And where the sand upon the path was wet, there were foot-marks of a very small person. Lucie ran on, and on. The path ended under a big rock. The grass was short and green, and there were clothes, props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins, but no pocket-handkerchiefs! But there was something else, a door! straight into the hill; and inside it some one was singing,  'Lily-white and clean, oh! With little frills between, oh! Smooth and hot, red rusty spot Never here be seen, oh!' Lucie, knocked, once, twice, and interrupted the song. A little frightened voice called out 'Who's that?' Lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?, a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams, just like any other farm kitchen. Only the ceiling was so low that Lucie's head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything there. There was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her hand stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie. Her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat. Her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap, where Lucie had yellow curls, that little person had PRICKLES! 'Who are you?' said Lucie. 'Have you seen my pocket-handkins?' The little person made a bob-curtsey, 'Oh, yes, if you please'm; my name is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle; oh, yes if you please'm, I'm an excellent clear-starcher!' And she took something out of a clothes-basket, and spread it on the ironing-blanket. 'What's that thing?' said Lucie, 'that's not my pocket-handkin?' 'Oh no, if you please'm; that's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to Cock Robin!' And she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side. Then she took something else off a clothes-horse,  'That isn't my pinny?' said Lucie. 'Oh no, if you please'm; that's a damask table-cloth belonging to Jenny Wren; look how it's stained with currant wine! It's very bad to wash!' said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire. 'There's one of my pocket-handkins!' cried Lucie, 'and there's my pinny!' Mrs. Tiggy-winkle ironed it, and goffered it, and shook out the frills. 'Oh that is lovely!' said Lucie. 'And what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?' 'Oh, that's a pair of stockings belonging to Sally Henny-penny, look how she's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard! She'll very soon go barefoot!' said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. 'Why, there's another handkersniff, but it isn't mine; it's red?' 'Oh no, if you please'm; that one belongs to old Mrs. Rabbit; and it did so smell of onions! I've had to wash it separately, I can't get out the smell.' 'There's another one of mine,' said Lucie. 'What are those funny little white things?' 'That's a pair of mittens belonging to Tabby Kitten; I only have to iron them; she washes them herself.' 'There's my last pocket-handkin!' said Lucie. 'And what are you dipping into the basin of starch?' 'They're little dicky shirt-fronts belonging to Tom Titmouse, most terrible particular!' said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. 'Now I've finished my ironing; I'm going to air some clothes.' 'What are these dear soft fluffy things?' said Lucie. 'Oh those are woolly coats belonging to the little lambs at Skelghyl.' 'Will their jackets take off?' asked Lucie. 'Oh yes, if you please'm; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder. And here's one marked for Gatesgarth, and three that come from Little-town. They're always marked at washing!' said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. And she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes, small brown coats of mice; and one velvety black moleskin waist-coat; and a red tailcoat with no tail belonging to Squirrel Nutkin; and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to Peter Rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had gone lost in the washing, and at last the basket was empty! 'Then Mrs. Tiggy-winkle made tea, a cup for herself and a cup for Lucie. They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another. Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her cap, there were hair-pins sticking wrong end out; so that Lucie didn't like to sit too near her. When they had finished tea, they tied up the clothes in bundles; and Lucie's pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny, and fastened with a silver safety-pin. And then they made up the fire with turf, and came out and locked the door, and hid the key under the door-sill. Then away down the hill trotted Lucie and Mrs. Tiggy-winkle with the bundles of clothes! All the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them; the very first that they met were Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny! And she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. So that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile, there was nothing left to carry except Lucie's one little bundle. Lucie scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she turned to say 'Good-night,' and to thank the washer-woman, But what a very odd thing! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill! She was running running running up the hill, and where was her white frilled cap? and her shawl? and her gown, and her petticoat? And how small she had grown, and how brown, and covered with PRICKLES! Why! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was nothing but a HEDGEHOG. (Now some people say that little Lucie had been asleep upon the stile, but then how could she have found three clean pocket-handkins and a pinny, pinned with a silver safety-pin? And besides, I have seen that door into the back of the hill called Cat Bells, and besides I am very well acquainted with dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle!) Once upon a time there was an old cat, called Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit, who was an anxious parent. She used to lose her kittens continually, and whenever they were lost they were always in mischief! On baking day she determined to shut them up in a cupboard. She caught Moppet and Mittens, but she could not find Tom. Mrs. Tabitha went up and down all over the house, mewing for Tom Kitten. She looked in the pantry under the staircase, and she searched the best spare bedroom that was all covered up with dust sheets. She went right upstairs and looked into the attics, but she could not find him anywhere. It was an old, old house, full of cupboards and passages. Some of the walls were four feet thick, and there used to be queer noises inside them, as if there might be a little secret staircase. Certainly there were odd little jagged doorways in the wainscot, and things disappeared at night, especially cheese and bacon. Mrs. Tabitha became more and more distracted, and mewed dreadfully. While their mother was searching the house, Moppet and Mittens had got into mischief. The cupboard door was not locked, so they pushed it open and came out. They went straight to the dough which was set to rise in a pan before the fire. They patted it with their little soft paws, 'Shall we make dear little muffins?' said Mittens to Moppet. But just at that moment somebody knocked at the front door, and Moppet jumped into the flour barrel in a fright. Mittens ran away to the dairy, and hid in an empty jar on the stone shelf where the milk pans stand. The visitor was a neighbour, Mrs. Ribby; she had called to borrow some yeast. Mrs. Tabitha came downstairs mewing dreadfully, 'Come in, Cousin Ribby, come in, and sit ye down! I'm in sad trouble, Cousin Ribby,' said Tabitha, shedding tears. 'I've lost my dear son Thomas; I'm afraid the rats have got him.' She wiped her eyes with her apron. 'He's a bad kitten, Cousin Tabitha; he made a cat's cradle of my best bonnet last time I came to tea. Where have you looked for him?' 'All over the house! The rats are too many for me. What a thing it is to have an unruly family!' said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit. 'I'm not afraid of rats; I will help you to find him; and whip him too! What is all that soot in the fender?' 'The chimney wants sweeping, Oh, dear me, Cousin Ribby, now Moppet and Mittens are gone!' 'They have both got out of the cupboard!' Ribby and Tabitha set to work to search the house thoroughly again. They poked under the beds with Ribby's umbrella, and they rummaged in cupboards. They even fetched a candle, and looked inside a clothes chest in one of the attics. They could not find anything, but once they heard a door bang and somebody scuttered downstairs. 'Yes, it is infested with rats,' said Tabitha tearfully. 'I caught seven young ones out of one hole in the back kitchen, and we had them for dinner last Saturday. And once I saw the old father rat, an enormous old rat, Cousin Ribby. I was just going to jump upon him, when he showed his yellow teeth at me and whisked down the hole.' 'The rats get upon my nerves, Cousin Ribby,' said Tabitha. Ribby and Tabitha searched and searched. They both heard a curious roly-poly noise under the attic floor. But there was nothing to be seen. They returned to the kitchen. 'Here's one of your kittens at least,' said Ribby, dragging Moppet out of the flour barrel. They shook the flour off her and set her down on the kitchen floor. She seemed to be in a terrible fright. 'Oh! Mother, Mother,' said Moppet, 'there's been an old woman rat in the kitchen, and she's stolen some of the dough!' The two cats ran to look at the dough pan. Sure enough there were marks of little scratching fingers, and a lump of dough was gone! 'Which way did she go, Moppet?' But Moppet had been too much frightened to peep out of the barrel again. Ribby and Tabitha took her with them to keep her safely in sight, while they went on with their search. They went into the dairy. The first thing they found was Mittens, hiding in an empty jar. They tipped up the jar, and she scrambled out. 'Oh, Mother, Mother!' said Mittens,  'Oh! Mother, Mother, there has been an old man rat in the dairy, a dreadful 'normous big rat, mother; and he's stolen a pat of butter and the rolling-pin.' Ribby and Tabitha looked at one another. 'A rolling-pin and butter! Oh, my poor son Thomas!' exclaimed Tabitha, wringing her paws. 'A rolling-pin?' said Ribby. 'Did we not hear a roly-poly noise in the attic when we were looking into that chest?' Ribby and Tabitha rushed upstairs again. Sure enough the roly-poly noise was still going on quite distinctly under the attic floor. 'This is serious, Cousin Tabitha,' said Ribby. 'We must send for John Joiner at once, with a saw.' Now this is what had been happening to Tom Kitten, and it shows how very unwise it is to go up a chimney in a very old house, where a person does not know his way, and where there are enormous rats. Tom Kitten did not want to be shut up in a cupboard. When he saw that his mother was going to bake, he determined to hide. He looked about for a nice convenient place, and he fixed upon the chimney. The fire had only just been lighted, and it was not hot; but there was a white choky smoke from the green sticks. Tom Kitten got upon the fender and looked up. It was a big old-fashioned fire-place. The chimney itself was wide enough inside for a man to stand up and walk about. So there was plenty of room for a little Tom Cat. He jumped right up into the fire-place, balancing himself upon the iron bar where the kettle hangs. Tom Kitten took another big jump off the bar, and landed on a ledge high up inside the chimney, knocking down some soot into the fender. Tom Kitten coughed and choked with the smoke; and he could hear the sticks beginning to crackle and burn in the fire-place down below. He made up his mind to climb right to the top, and get out on the slates, and try to catch sparrows. 'I cannot go back. If I slipped I might fall in the fire and singe my beautiful tail and my little blue jacket.' The chimney was a very big old-fashioned one. It was built in the days when people burnt logs of wood upon the hearth. The chimney stack stood up above the roof like a little stone tower, and the daylight shone down from the top, under the slanting slates that kept out the rain. Tom Kitten was getting very frightened! He climbed up, and up, and up. Then he waded sideways through inches of soot. He was like a little sweep himself. It was most confusing in the dark. One flue seemed to lead into another. There was less smoke, but Tom Kitten felt quite lost. He scrambled up and up; but before he reached the chimney top he came to a place where somebody had loosened a stone in the wall. There were some mutton bones lying about,  'This seems funny,' said Tom Kitten. 'Who has been gnawing bones up here in the chimney? I wish I had never come! And what a funny smell? It is something like mouse; only dreadfully strong. It makes me sneeze,' said Tom Kitten. He squeezed through the hole in the wall, and dragged himself along a most uncomfortably tight passage where there was scarcely any light. He groped his way carefully for several yards; he was at the back of the skirting-board in the attic, where there is a little mark   in the picture. All at once he fell head over heels in the dark, down a hole, and landed on a heap of very dirty rags. When Tom Kitten picked himself up and looked about him, he found himself in a place that he had never seen before, although he had lived all his life in the house. It was a very small stuffy fusty room, with boards, and rafters, and cobwebs, and lath and plaster. Opposite to him, as far away as he could sit, was an enormous rat. 'What do you mean by tumbling into my bed all covered with smuts?' said the rat, chattering his teeth. 'Please sir, the chimney wants sweeping,' said poor Tom Kitten. 'Anna Maria! Anna Maria!' squeaked the rat. There was a pattering noise and an old woman rat poked her head round a rafter. All in a minute she rushed upon Tom Kitten, and before he knew what was happening,  His coat was pulled off, and he was rolled up in a bundle, and tied with string in very hard knots. Anna Maria did the tying. The old rat watched her and took snuff. When she had finished, they both sat staring at him with their mouths open. 'Anna Maria,' said the old man rat (whose name was Samuel Whiskers),, 'Anna Maria, make me a kitten dumpling roly-poly pudding for my dinner.' 'It requires dough and a pat of butter, and a rolling-pin,' said Anna Maria, considering Tom Kitten with her head on one side. 'No,' said Samuel Whiskers, 'make it properly, Anna Maria, with breadcrumbs.' 'Nonsense! Butter and dough,' replied Anna Maria. The two rats consulted together for a few minutes and then went away. Samuel Whiskers got through a hole in the wainscot, and went boldly down the front staircase to the dairy to get the butter. He did not meet anybody. He made a second journey for the rolling-pin. He pushed it in front of him with his paws, like a brewer's man trundling a barrel. He could hear Ribby and Tabitha talking, but they were busy lighting the candle to look into the chest. They did not see him. Anna Maria went down by way of the skirting-board and a window shutter to the kitchen to steal the dough. She borrowed a small saucer, and scooped up the dough with her paws. She did not observe Moppet. While Tom Kitten was left alone under the floor of the attic, he wriggled about and tried to mew for help. But his mouth was full of soot and cobwebs, and he was tied up in such very tight knots, he could not make anybody hear him. Except a spider, which came out of a crack in the ceiling and examined the knots critically, from a safe distance. It was a judge of knots because it had a habit of tying up unfortunate blue-bottles. It did not offer to assist him. Tom Kitten wriggled and squirmed until he was quite exhausted. Presently the rats came back and set to work to make him into a dumpling. First they smeared him with butter, and then they rolled him in the dough. 'Will not the string be very indigestible, Anna Maria?' inquired Samuel Whiskers. Anna Maria said she thought that it was of no consequence; but she wished that Tom Kitten would hold his head still, as it disarranged the pastry. She laid hold of his ears. Tom Kitten bit and spat, and mewed and wriggled; and the rolling-pin went roly-poly, roly; roly, poly, roly. The rats each held an end. 'His tail is sticking out! You did not fetch enough dough, Anna Maria.' 'I fetched as much as I could carry,' replied Anna Maria. 'I do not think', said Samuel Whiskers, pausing to take a look at Tom Kitten, 'I do  not  think it will be a good pudding. It smells sooty.' Anna Maria was about to argue the point, when all at once there began to be other sounds up above, the rasping noise of a saw; and the noise of a little dog, scratching and yelping! The rats dropped the rolling-pin, and listened attentively. 'We are discovered and interrupted, Anna Maria; let us collect our property, and other people's,, and depart at once.' 'I fear that we shall be obliged to leave this pudding.' 'But I am persuaded that the knots would have proved indigestible, whatever you may urge to the contrary.' 'Come away at once and help me to tie up some mutton bones in a counterpane,' said Anna Maria. 'I have got half a smoked ham hidden in the chimney.' So it happened that by the time John Joiner had got the plank up, there was nobody under the floor except the rolling-pin and Tom Kitten in a very dirty dumpling! But there was a strong smell of rats; and John Joiner spent the rest of the morning sniffing and whining, and wagging his tail, and going round and round with his head in the hole like a gimlet. Then he nailed the plank down again and put his tools in his bag, and came downstairs. The cat family had quite recovered. They invited him to stay to dinner. The dumpling had been peeled off Tom Kitten, and made separately into a bag pudding, with currants in it to hide the smuts. They had been obliged to put Tom Kitten into a hot bath to get the butter off. John Joiner smelt the pudding; but he regretted that he had not time to stay to dinner, because he had just finished making a wheel-barrow for Miss Potter, and she had ordered two hen-coops. And when I was going to the post late in the afternoon, I looked up the lane from the corner, and I saw Mr. Samuel Whiskers and his wife on the run, with big bundles on a little wheel-barrow, which looked very like mine. They were just turning in at the gate to the barn of Farmer Potatoes. Samuel Whiskers was puffing and out of breath. Anna Maria was still arguing in shrill tones. She seemed to know her way, and she seemed to have a quantity of luggage. I am sure  I  never gave her leave to borrow my wheel-barrow! They went into the barn, and hauled their parcels with a bit of string to the top of the hay mow. After that, there were no more rats for a long time at Tabitha Twitchit's. As for Farmer Potatoes, he has been driven nearly distracted. There are rats, and rats, and rats in his barn! They eat up the chicken food, and steal the oats and bran, and make holes in the meal bags. And they are all descended from Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Whiskers, children and grand-children and great great grand-children. There is no end to them! Moppet and Mittens have grown up into very good rat-catchers. They go out rat-catching in the village, and they find plenty of employment. They charge so much a dozen, and earn their living very comfortably. They hang up the rats' tails in a row on the barn door, to show how many they have caught, dozens and dozens of them. But Tom Kitten has always been afraid of a rat; he never durst face anything that is bigger than,  A Mouse.  'Twas the Night before Christmas 'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse; The stockings were hung by the chimney with care In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there; The children were nestled all snug in their beds, While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads; And mamma in her kerchief, and I in my cap, Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap, When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter. Away to the window I flew like a flash, Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash. The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below, When, what to my wondering eyes should appear, But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer, With a little old driver, so lively and quick, I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick. More rapid than eagles his coursers they came, And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name: 'Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen! On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donder and Blitzen! To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall! Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!' As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky; So up to the house-top the coursers they flew, With the sleigh full of Toys, and St. Nicholas too. And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof The prancing and pawing of each little hoof. As I drew in my head, and was turning around, Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound. He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot, And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot; A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back, And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack. His eyes, how they twinkled! his dimples how merry! His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry! His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow; The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath; He had a broad face and a little round belly, That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly. He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself; A wink of his eye and a twist of his head, Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread; He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk, And laying his finger aside of his nose, And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose; He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, And away they all flew like the down of a thistle. But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, 'Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night.' 1.  Burzee Have you heard of the great Forest of Burzee?  Nurse used to sing of it when I was a child.  She sang of the big tree-trunks, standing close together, with their roots intertwining below the earth and their branches intertwining above it; of their rough coating of bark and queer, gnarled limbs; of the bushy foliage that roofed the entire forest, save where the sunbeams found a path through which to touch the ground in little spots and to cast weird and curious shadows over the mosses, the lichens and the drifts of dried leaves. The Forest of Burzee is mighty and grand and awesome to those who steal beneath its shade.  Coming from the sunlit meadows into its mazes it seems at first gloomy, then pleasant, and afterward filled with never-ending delights. For hundreds of years it has flourished in all its magnificence, the silence of its inclosure unbroken save by the chirp of busy chipmunks, the growl of wild beasts and the songs of birds. Yet Burzee has its inhabitants, for all this.  Nature peopled it in the beginning with Fairies, Knooks, Ryls and Nymphs.  As long as the Forest stands it will be a home, a refuge and a playground to these sweet immortals, who revel undisturbed in its depths. Civilization has never yet reached Burzee.  Will it ever, I wonder? 2.  The Child of the Forest Once, so long ago our great-grandfathers could scarcely have heard it mentioned, there lived within the great Forest of Burzee a wood-nymph named Necile.  She was closely related to the mighty Queen Zurline, and her home was beneath the shade of a widespreading oak.  Once every year, on Budding Day, when the trees put forth their new buds, Necile held the Golden Chalice of Ak to the lips of the Queen, who drank therefrom to the prosperity of the Forest.  So you see she was a nymph of some importance, and, moreover, it is said she was highly regarded because of her beauty and grace. When she was created she could not have told; Queen Zurline could not have told; the great Ak himself could not have told.  It was long ago when the world was new and nymphs were needed to guard the forests and to minister to the wants of the young trees.  Then, on some day not remembered, Necile sprang into being; radiant, lovely, straight and slim as the sapling she was created to guard. Her hair was the color that lines a chestnut-bur; her eyes were blue in the sunlight and purple in the shade; her cheeks bloomed with the faint pink that edges the clouds at sunset; her lips were full red, pouting and sweet.  For costume she adopted oak-leaf green; all the wood-nymphs dress in that color and know no other so desirable.  Her dainty feet were sandal-clad, while her head remained bare of covering other than her silken tresses. Necile's duties were few and simple.  She kept hurtful weeds from growing beneath her trees and sapping the earth-food required by her charges.  She frightened away the Gadgols, who took evil delight in flying against the tree-trunks and wounding them so that they drooped and died from the poisonous contact.  In dry seasons she carried water from the brooks and pools and moistened the roots of her thirsty dependents. That was in the beginning.  The weeds had now learned to avoid the forests where wood-nymphs dwelt; the loathsome Gadgols no longer dared come nigh; the trees had become old and sturdy and could bear the drought better than when fresh-sprouted.  So Necile's duties were lessened, and time grew laggard, while succeeding years became more tiresome and uneventful than the nymph's joyous spirit loved. Truly the forest-dwellers did not lack amusement.  Each full moon they danced in the Royal Circle of the Queen.  There were also the Feast of Nuts, the Jubilee of Autumn Tintings, the solemn ceremony of Leaf Shedding and the revelry of Budding Day.  But these periods of enjoyment were far apart, and left many weary hours between. That a wood-nymph should grow discontented was not thought of by Necile's sisters.  It came upon her only after many years of brooding. But when once she had settled in her mind that life was irksome she had no patience with her condition, and longed to do something of real interest and to pass her days in ways hitherto undreamed of by forest nymphs.  The Law of the Forest alone restrained her from going forth in search of adventure. While this mood lay heavy upon pretty Necile it chanced that the great Ak visited the Forest of Burzee and allowed the wood-nymphs as was their wont, to lie at his feet and listen to the words of wisdom that fell from his lips.  Ak is the Master Woodsman of the world; he sees everything, and knows more than the sons of men. That night he held the Queen's hand, for he loved the nymphs as a father loves his children; and Necile lay at his feet with many of her sisters and earnestly harkened as he spoke. 'We live so happily, my fair ones, in our forest glades,' said Ak, stroking his grizzled beard thoughtfully, 'that we know nothing of the sorrow and misery that fall to the lot of those poor mortals who inhabit the open spaces of the earth.  They are not of our race, it is true, yet compassion well befits beings so fairly favored as ourselves. Often as I pass by the dwelling of some suffering mortal I am tempted to stop and banish the poor thing's misery.  Yet suffering, in moderation, is the natural lot of mortals, and it is not our place to interfere with the laws of Nature.' 'Nevertheless,' said the fair Queen, nodding her golden head at the Master Woodsman, 'it would not be a vain guess that Ak has often assisted these hapless mortals.' Ak smiled. 'Sometimes,' he replied, 'when they are very young, 'children,' the mortals call them, I have stopped to rescue them from misery.  The men and women I dare not interfere with; they must bear the burdens Nature has imposed upon them.  But the helpless infants, the innocent children of men, have a right to be happy until they become full-grown and able to bear the trials of humanity.  So I feel I am justified in assisting them.  Not long ago, a year, maybe, I found four poor children huddled in a wooden hut, slowly freezing to death.  Their parents had gone to a neighboring village for food, and had left a fire to warm their little ones while they were absent.  But a storm arose and drifted the snow in their path, so they were long on the road.  Meantime the fire went out and the frost crept into the bones of the waiting children.' 'Poor things!' murmured the Queen softly.  'What did you do?' 'I called Nelko, bidding him fetch wood from my forests and breathe upon it until the fire blazed again and warmed the little room where the children lay.  Then they ceased shivering and fell asleep until their parents came.' 'I am glad you did thus,' said the good Queen, beaming upon the Master; and Necile, who had eagerly listened to every word, echoed in a whisper: 'I, too, am glad!' 'And this very night,' continued Ak, 'as I came to the edge of Burzee I heard a feeble cry, which I judged came from a human infant.  I looked about me and found, close to the forest, a helpless babe, lying quite naked upon the grasses and wailing piteously.  Not far away, screened by the forest, crouched Shiegra, the lioness, intent upon devouring the infant for her evening meal.' 'And what did you do, Ak?' asked the Queen, breathlessly. 'Not much, being in a hurry to greet my nymphs.  But I commanded Shiegra to lie close to the babe, and to give it her milk to quiet its hunger.  And I told her to send word throughout the forest, to all beasts and reptiles, that the child should not be harmed.' 'I am glad you did thus,' said the good Queen again, in a tone of relief; but this time Necile did not echo her words, for the nymph, filled with a strange resolve, had suddenly stolen away from the group. Swiftly her lithe form darted through the forest paths until she reached the edge of mighty Burzee, when she paused to gaze curiously about her.  Never until now had she ventured so far, for the Law of the Forest had placed the nymphs in its inmost depths. Necile knew she was breaking the Law, but the thought did not give pause to her dainty feet.  She had decided to see with her own eyes this infant Ak had told of, for she had never yet beheld a child of man.  All the immortals are full-grown; there are no children among them.  Peering through the trees Necile saw the child lying on the grass.  But now it was sweetly sleeping, having been comforted by the milk drawn from Shiegra.  It was not old enough to know what peril means; if it did not feel hunger it was content. Softly the nymph stole to the side of the babe and knelt upon the sward, her long robe of rose leaf color spreading about her like a gossamer cloud.  Her lovely countenance expressed curiosity and surprise, but, most of all, a tender, womanly pity.  The babe was newborn, chubby and pink.  It was entirely helpless.  While the nymph gazed the infant opened its eyes, smiled upon her, and stretched out two dimpled arms.  In another instant Necile had caught it to her breast and was hurrying with it through the forest paths. 3.  The Adoption The Master Woodsman suddenly rose, with knitted brows.  'There is a strange presence in the Forest,' he declared.  Then the Queen and her nymphs turned and saw standing before them Necile, with the sleeping infant clasped tightly in her arms and a defiant look in her deep blue eyes. And thus for a moment they remained, the nymphs filled with surprise and consternation, but the brow of the Master Woodsman gradually clearing as he gazed intently upon the beautiful immortal who had wilfully broken the Law.  Then the great Ak, to the wonder of all, laid his hand softly on Necile's flowing locks and kissed her on her fair forehead. 'For the first time within my knowledge,' said he, gently, 'a nymph has defied me and my laws; yet in my heart can I find no word of chiding. What is your desire, Necile?' 'Let me keep the child!' she answered, beginning to tremble and falling on her knees in supplication. 'Here, in the Forest of Burzee, where the human race has never yet penetrated?' questioned Ak. 'Here, in the Forest of Burzee,' replied the nymph, boldly.  'It is my home, and I am weary for lack of occupation.  Let me care for the babe! See how weak and helpless it is.  Surely it can not harm Burzee nor the Master Woodsman of the World!' 'But the Law, child, the Law!' cried Ak, sternly. 'The Law is made by the Master Woodsman,' returned Necile; 'if he bids me care for the babe he himself has saved from death, who in all the world dare oppose me?'  Queen Zurline, who had listened intently to this conversation, clapped her pretty hands gleefully at the nymph's answer. 'You are fairly trapped, O Ak!' she exclaimed, laughing.  'Now, I pray you, give heed to Necile's petition.' The Woodsman, as was his habit when in thought, stroked his grizzled beard slowly.  Then he said: 'She shall keep the babe, and I will give it my protection.  But I warn you all that as this is the first time I have relaxed the Law, so shall it be the last time.  Never more, to the end of the World, shall a mortal be adopted by an immortal.  Otherwise would we abandon our happy existence for one of trouble and anxiety.  Good night, my nymphs!' Then Ak was gone from their midst, and Necile hurried away to her bower to rejoice over her new-found treasure. 4.  Claus Another day found Necile's bower the most popular place in the Forest. The nymphs clustered around her and the child that lay asleep in her lap, with expressions of curiosity and delight.  Nor were they wanting in praises for the great Ak's kindness in allowing Necile to keep the babe and to care for it.  Even the Queen came to peer into the innocent childish face and to hold a helpless, chubby fist in her own fair hand. 'What shall we call him, Necile?' she asked, smiling.  'He must have a name, you know.' 'Let him be called Claus,' answered Necile, 'for that means 'a little one.'' 'Rather let him be called Neclaus,'   returned the Queen, 'for that will mean 'Necile's little one.'' The nymphs clapped their hands in delight, and Neclaus became the infant's name, although Necile loved best to call him Claus, and in afterdays many of her sisters followed her example. Necile gathered the softest moss in all the forest for Claus to lie upon, and she made his bed in her own bower.  Of food the infant had no lack.  The nymphs searched the forest for bell-udders, which grow upon the goa-tree and when opened are found to be filled with sweet milk. And the soft-eyed does willingly gave a share of their milk to support the little stranger, while Shiegra, the lioness, often crept stealthily into Necile's bower and purred softly as she lay beside the babe and fed it. So the little one flourished and grew big and sturdy day by day, while Necile taught him to speak and to walk and to play. His thoughts and words were sweet and gentle, for the nymphs knew no evil and their hearts were pure and loving.  He became the pet of the forest, for Ak's decree had forbidden beast or reptile to molest him, and he walked fearlessly wherever his will guided him. Presently the news reached the other immortals that the nymphs of Burzee had adopted a human infant, and that the act had been sanctioned by the great Ak.  Therefore many of them came to visit the little stranger, looking upon him with much interest.  First the Ryls, who are first cousins to the wood-nymphs, although so differently formed.  For the Ryls are required to watch over the flowers and plants, as the nymphs watch over the forest trees.  They search the wide world for the food required by the roots of the flowering plants, while the brilliant colors possessed by the full-blown flowers are due to the dyes placed in the soil by the Ryls, which are drawn through the little veins in the roots and the body of the plants, as they reach maturity.  The Ryls are a busy people, for their flowers bloom and fade continually, but they are merry and light-hearted and are very popular with the other immortals. Next came the Knooks, whose duty it is to watch over the beasts of the world, both gentle and wild.  The Knooks have a hard time of it, since many of the beasts are ungovernable and rebel against restraint.  But they know how to manage them, after all, and you will find that certain laws of the Knooks are obeyed by even the most ferocious animals. Their anxieties make the Knooks look old and worn and crooked, and their natures are a bit rough from associating with wild creatures continually; yet they are most useful to humanity and to the world in general, as their laws are the only laws the forest beasts recognize except those of the Master Woodsman. Then there were the Fairies, the guardians of mankind, who were much interested in the adoption of Claus because their own laws forbade them to become familiar with their human charges.  There are instances on record where the Fairies have shown themselves to human beings, and have even conversed with them; but they are supposed to guard the lives of mankind unseen and unknown, and if they favor some people more than others it is because these have won such distinction fairly, as the Fairies are very just and impartial.  But the idea of adopting a child of men had never occurred to them because it was in every way opposed to their laws;  so their curiosity was intense to behold the little stranger adopted by Necile and her sister nymphs. Claus looked upon the immortals who thronged around him with fearless eyes and smiling lips.  He rode laughingly upon the shoulders of the merry Ryls; he mischievously pulled the gray beards of the low-browed Knooks;  he rested his curly head confidently upon the dainty bosom of the Fairy Queen herself.  And the Ryls loved the sound of his laughter; the Knooks loved his courage; the Fairies loved his innocence. The boy made friends of them all, and learned to know their laws intimately.  No forest flower was trampled beneath his feet, lest the friendly Ryls should be grieved.  He never interfered with the beasts of the forest, lest his friends the Knooks should become angry.  The Fairies he loved dearly, but, knowing nothing of mankind, he could not understand that he was the only one of his race admitted to friendly intercourse with them. Indeed, Claus came to consider that he alone, of all the forest people, had no like nor fellow.  To him the forest was the world.  He had no idea that millions of toiling, striving human creatures existed. And he was happy and content.    Some people have spelled this name Nicklaus and others Nicolas,    which is the reason that Santa Claus is still known in some lands    as St. Nicolas.  But, of course, Neclaus is his right name, and    Claus the nickname given him by his adopted mother, the fair nymph    Necile. 5.  The Master Woodsman Years pass swiftly in Burzee, for the nymphs have no need to regard time in any way.  Even centuries make no change in the dainty creatures; ever and ever they remain the same, immortal and unchanging. Claus, however, being mortal, grew to manhood day by day.  Necile was disturbed, presently, to find him too big to lie in her lap, and he had a desire for other food than milk.  His stout legs carried him far into Burzee's heart, where he gathered supplies of nuts and berries, as well as several sweet and wholesome roots, which suited his stomach better than the belludders.  He sought Necile's bower less frequently, till finally it became his custom to return thither only to sleep. The nymph, who had come to love him dearly, was puzzled to comprehend the changed nature of her charge, and unconsciously altered her own mode of life to conform to his whims.  She followed him readily through the forest paths, as did many of her sister nymphs, explaining as they walked all the mysteries of the gigantic wood and the habits and nature of the living things which dwelt beneath its shade. The language of the beasts became clear to little Claus; but he never could understand their sulky and morose tempers.  Only the squirrels, the mice and the rabbits seemed to possess cheerful and merry natures; yet would the boy laugh when the panther growled, and stroke the bear's glossy coat while the creature snarled and bared its teeth menacingly. The growls and snarls were not for Claus, he well knew, so what did they matter? He could sing the songs of the bees, recite the poetry of the wood-flowers and relate the history of every blinking owl in Burzee. He helped the Ryls to feed their plants and the Knooks to keep order among the animals.  The little immortals regarded him as a privileged person, being especially protected by Queen Zurline and her nymphs and favored by the great Ak himself. One day the Master Woodsman came back to the forest of Burzee.  He had visited, in turn, all his forests throughout the world, and they were many and broad. Not until he entered the glade where the Queen and her nymphs were assembled to greet him did Ak remember the child he had permitted Necile to adopt.  Then he found, sitting familiarly in the circle of lovely immortals, a broad-shouldered, stalwart youth, who, when erect, stood fully as high as the shoulder of the Master himself. Ak paused, silent and frowning, to bend his piercing gaze upon Claus. The clear eyes met his own steadfastly, and the Woodsman gave a sigh of relief as he marked their placid depths and read the youth's brave and innocent heart.  Nevertheless, as Ak sat beside the fair Queen, and the golden chalice, filled with rare nectar, passed from lip to lip, the Master Woodsman was strangely silent and reserved, and stroked his beard many times with a thoughtful motion. With morning he called Claus aside, in kindly fashion, saying: 'Bid good by, for a time, to Necile and her sisters; for you shall accompany me on my journey through the world.' The venture pleased Claus, who knew well the honor of being companion of the Master Woodsman of the world.  But Necile wept for the first time in her life, and clung to the boy's neck as if she could not bear to let him go.  The nymph who had mothered this sturdy youth was still as dainty, as charming and beautiful as when she had dared to face Ak with the babe clasped to her breast; nor was her love less great.  Ak beheld the two clinging together, seemingly as brother and sister to one another, and again he wore his thoughtful look. 6.  Claus Discovers Humanity Taking Claus to a small clearing in the forest, the Master said: 'Place your hand upon my girdle and hold fast while we journey through the air; for now shall we encircle the world and look upon many of the haunts of those men from whom you are descended.' These words caused Claus to marvel, for until now he had thought himself the only one of his kind upon the earth; yet in silence he grasped firmly the girdle of the great Ak, his astonishment forbidding speech. Then the vast forest of Burzee seemed to fall away from their feet, and the youth found himself passing swiftly through the air at a great height. Ere long there were spires beneath them, while buildings of many shapes and colors met their downward view.  It was a city of men, and Ak, pausing to descend, led Claus to its inclosure.  Said the Master: 'So long as you hold fast to my girdle you will remain unseen by all mankind, though seeing clearly yourself.  To release your grasp will be to separate yourself forever from me and your home in Burzee.' One of the first laws of the Forest is obedience, and Claus had no thought of disobeying the Master's wish.  He clung fast to the girdle and remained invisible. Thereafter with each moment passed in the city the youth's wonder grew. He, who had supposed himself created differently from all others, now found the earth swarming with creatures of his own kind. 'Indeed,' said Ak, 'the immortals are few; but the mortals are many.' Claus looked earnestly upon his fellows.  There were sad faces, gay and reckless faces, pleasant faces, anxious faces and kindly faces, all mingled in puzzling disorder.  Some worked at tedious tasks; some strutted in impudent conceit; some were thoughtful and grave while others seemed happy and content.  Men of many natures were there, as everywhere, and Claus found much to please him and much to make him sad. But especially he noted the children, first curiously, then eagerly, then lovingly.  Ragged little ones rolled in the dust of the streets, playing with scraps and pebbles.  Other children, gaily dressed, were propped upon cushions and fed with sugar-plums.  Yet the children of the rich were not happier than those playing with the dust and pebbles, it seemed to Claus. 'Childhood is the time of man's greatest content,' said Ak, following the youth's thoughts.  ''Tis during these years of innocent pleasure that the little ones are most free from care.' 'Tell me,' said Claus, 'why do not all these babies fare alike?' 'Because they are born in both cottage and palace,' returned the Master.  'The difference in the wealth of the parents determines the lot of the child.  Some are carefully tended and clothed in silks and dainty linen; others are neglected and covered with rags.' 'Yet all seem equally fair and sweet,' said Claus, thoughtfully. 'While they are babes, yes;' agreed Ak.  'Their joy is in being alive, and they do not stop to think.  In after years the doom of mankind overtakes them, and they find they must struggle and worry, work and fret, to gain the wealth that is so dear to the hearts of men.  Such things are unknown in the Forest where you were reared.'  Claus was silent a moment.  Then he asked: 'Why was I reared in the forest, among those who are not of my race?' Then Ak, in gentle voice, told him the story of his babyhood: how he had been abandoned at the forest's edge and left a prey to wild beasts, and how the loving nymph Necile had rescued him and brought him to manhood under the protection of the immortals. 'Yet I am not of them,' said Claus, musingly. 'You are not of them,' returned the Woodsman.  'The nymph who cared for you as a mother seems now like a sister to you; by and by, when you grow old and gray, she will seem like a daughter.  Yet another brief span and you will be but a memory, while she remains Necile.' 'Then why, if man must perish, is he born?' demanded the boy. 'Everything perishes except the world itself and its keepers,' answered Ak.  'But while life lasts everything on earth has its use.  The wise seek ways to be helpful to the world, for the helpful ones are sure to live again.' Much of this Claus failed to understand fully, but a longing seized him to become helpful to his fellows, and he remained grave and thoughtful while they resumed their journey. They visited many dwellings of men in many parts of the world, watching farmers toil in the fields, warriors dash into cruel fray, and merchants exchange their goods for bits of white and yellow metal.  And everywhere the eyes of Claus sought out the children in love and pity, for the thought of his own helpless babyhood was strong within him and he yearned to give help to the innocent little ones of his race even as he had been succored by the kindly nymph. Day by day the Master Woodsman and his pupil traversed the earth, Ak speaking but seldom to the youth who clung steadfastly to his girdle, but guiding him into all places where he might become familiar with the lives of human beings. And at last they returned to the grand old Forest of Burzee, where the Master set Claus down within the circle of nymphs, among whom the pretty Necile anxiously awaited him. The brow of the great Ak was now calm and peaceful; but the brow of Claus had become lined with deep thought.  Necile sighed at the change in her foster-son, who until now had been ever joyous and smiling, and the thought came to her that never again would the life of the boy be the same as before this eventful journey with the Master. 7.  Claus Leaves the Forest When good Queen Zurline had touched the golden chalice with her fair lips and it had passed around the circle in honor of the travelers' return, the Master Woodsman of the World, who had not yet spoken, turned his gaze frankly upon Claus and said: 'Well?' The boy understood, and rose slowly to his feet beside Necile.  Once only his eyes passed around the familiar circle of nymphs, every one of whom he remembered as a loving comrade; but tears came unbidden to dim his sight, so he gazed thereafter steadfastly at the Master. 'I have been ignorant,' said he, simply, 'until the great Ak in his kindness taught me who and what I am.  You, who live so sweetly in your forest bowers, ever fair and youthful and innocent, are no fit comrades for a son of humanity.  For I have looked upon man, finding him doomed to live for a brief space upon earth, to toil for the things he needs, to fade into old age, and then to pass away as the leaves in autumn. Yet every man has his mission, which is to leave the world better, in some way, than he found it.  I am of the race of men, and man's lot is my lot.  For your tender care of the poor, forsaken babe you adopted, as well as for your loving comradeship during my boyhood, my heart will ever overflow with gratitude.  My foster-mother,' here he stopped and kissed Necile's white forehead, 'I shall love and cherish while life lasts.  But I must leave you, to take my part in the endless struggle to which humanity is doomed, and to live my life in my own way.' 'What will you do?' asked the Queen, gravely. 'I must devote myself to the care of the children of mankind, and try to make them happy,' he answered.  'Since your own tender care of a babe brought to me happiness and strength, it is just and right that I devote my life to the pleasure of other babes.  Thus will the memory of the loving nymph Necile be planted within the hearts of thousands of my race for many years to come, and her kindly act be recounted in song and in story while the world shall last.  Have I spoken well, O Master?' 'You have spoken well,' returned Ak, and rising to his feet he continued: 'Yet one thing must not be forgotten.  Having been adopted as the child of the Forest, and the playfellow of the nymphs, you have gained a distinction which forever separates you from your kind. Therefore, when you go forth into the world of men you shall retain the protection of the Forest, and the powers you now enjoy will remain with you to assist you in your labors.  In any need you may call upon the Nymphs, the Ryls, the Knooks and the Fairies, and they will serve you gladly.  I, the Master Woodsman of the World, have said it, and my Word is the Law!' Claus looked upon Ak with grateful eyes. 'This will make me mighty among men,' he replied.  'Protected by these kind friends I may be able to make thousands of little children happy. I will try very hard to do my duty, and I know the Forest people will give me their sympathy and help.' 'We will!' said the Fairy Queen, earnestly. 'We will!' cried the merry Ryls, laughing. 'We will!' shouted the crooked Knooks, scowling. 'We will!' exclaimed the sweet nymphs, proudly.  But Necile said nothing.  She only folded Claus in her arms and kissed him tenderly. 'The world is big,' continued the boy, turning again to his loyal friends, 'but men are everywhere.  I shall begin my work near my friends, so that if I meet with misfortune I can come to the Forest for counsel or help.' With that he gave them all a loving look and turned away.  There was no need to say good by, by for him the sweet, wild life of the Forest was over.  He went forth bravely to meet his doom, the doom of the race of man, the necessity to worry and work. But Ak, who knew the boy's heart, was merciful and guided his steps. Coming through Burzee to its eastern edge Claus reached the Laughing Valley of Hohaho.  On each side were rolling green hills, and a brook wandered midway between them to wind afar off beyond the valley.  At his back was the grim Forest; at the far end of the valley a broad plain.  The eyes of the young man, which had until now reflected his grave thoughts, became brighter as he stood silent, looking out upon the Laughing Valley.  Then on a sudden his eyes twinkled, as stars do on a still night, and grew merry and wide. For at his feet the cowslips and daisies smiled on him in friendly regard; the breeze whistled gaily as it passed by and fluttered the locks on his forehead; the brook laughed joyously as it leaped over the pebbles and swept around the green curves of its banks; the bees sang sweet songs as they flew from dandelion to daffodil; the beetles chirruped happily in the long grass, and the sunbeams glinted pleasantly over all the scene. 'Here,' cried Claus, stretching out his arms as if to embrace the Valley, 'will I make my home!' That was many, many years ago.  It has been his home ever since.  It is his home now. MANHOOD 1.  The Laughing Valley When Claus came the Valley was empty save for the grass, the brook, the wildflowers, the bees and the butterflies.  If he would make his home here and live after the fashion of men he must have a house.  This puzzled him at first, but while he stood smiling in the sunshine he suddenly found beside him old Nelko, the servant of the Master Woodsman.  Nelko bore an ax, strong and broad, with blade that gleamed like burnished silver.  This he placed in the young man's hand, then disappeared without a word. Claus understood, and turning to the Forest's edge he selected a number of fallen tree-trunks, which he began to clear of their dead branches. He would not cut into a living tree.  His life among the nymphs who guarded the Forest had taught him that a live tree is sacred, being a created thing endowed with feeling.  But with the dead and fallen trees it was different.  They had fulfilled their destiny, as active members of the Forest community, and now it was fitting that their remains should minister to the needs of man. The ax bit deep into the logs at every stroke.  It seemed to have a force of its own, and Claus had but to swing and guide it. When shadows began creeping over the green hills to lie in the Valley overnight, the young man had chopped many logs into equal lengths and proper shapes for building a house such as he had seen the poorer classes of men inhabit.  Then, resolving to await another day before he tried to fit the logs together, Claus ate some of the sweet roots he well knew how to find, drank deeply from the laughing brook, and lay down to sleep on the grass, first seeking a spot where no flowers grew, lest the weight of his body should crush them. And while he slumbered and breathed in the perfume of the wondrous Valley the Spirit of Happiness crept into his heart and drove out all terror and care and misgivings.  Never more would the face of Claus be clouded with anxieties; never more would the trials of life weigh him down as with a burden.  The Laughing Valley had claimed him for its own. Would that we all might live in that delightful place!, but then, maybe, it would become overcrowded.  For ages it had awaited a tenant. Was it chance that led young Claus to make his home in this happy vale? Or may we guess that his thoughtful friends, the immortals, had directed his steps when he wandered away from Burzee to seek a home in the great world? Certain it is that while the moon peered over the hilltop and flooded with its soft beams the body of the sleeping stranger, the Laughing Valley was filled with the queer, crooked shapes of the friendly Knooks.  These people spoke no words, but worked with skill and swiftness.  The logs Claus had trimmed with his bright ax were carried to a spot beside the brook and fitted one upon another, and during the night a strong and roomy dwelling was built. The birds came sweeping into the Valley at daybreak, and their songs, so seldom heard in the deep wood, aroused the stranger.  He rubbed the web of sleep from his eyelids and looked around.  The house met his gaze. 'I must thank the Knooks for this,' said he, gratefully.  Then he walked to his dwelling and entered at the doorway.  A large room faced him, having a fireplace at the end and a table and bench in the middle. Beside the fireplace was a cupboard.  Another doorway was beyond. Claus entered here, also, and saw a smaller room with a bed against the wall and a stool set near a small stand.  On the bed were many layers of dried moss brought from the Forest. 'Indeed, it is a palace!' exclaimed the smiling Claus.  'I must thank the good Knooks again, for their knowledge of man's needs as well as for their labors in my behalf.' He left his new home with a glad feeling that he was not quite alone in the world, although he had chosen to abandon his Forest life. Friendships are not easily broken, and the immortals are everywhere. Upon reaching the brook he drank of the pure water, and then sat down on the bank to laugh at the mischievous gambols of the ripples as they pushed one another against rocks or crowded desperately to see which should first reach the turn beyond.  And as they raced away he listened to the song they sang:   'Rushing, pushing, on we go!   Not a wave may gently flow,      All are too excited.     Ev'ry drop, delighted,   Turns to spray in merry play   As we tumble on our way!' Next Claus searched for roots to eat, while the daffodils turned their little eyes up to him laughingly and lisped their dainty song:   'Blooming fairly, growing rarely,     Never flowerets were so gay!   Perfume breathing, joy bequeathing,     As our colors we display.' It made Claus laugh to hear the little things voice their happiness as they nodded gracefully on their stems.  But another strain caught his ear as the sunbeams fell gently across his face and whispered:   'Here is gladness, that our rays     Warm the valley through the days;   Here is happiness, to give     Comfort unto all who live!' 'Yes!' cried Claus in answer, 'there is happiness and joy in all things here.  The Laughing Valley is a valley of peace and good-will.' He passed the day talking with the ants and beetles and exchanging jokes with the light-hearted butterflies.  And at night he lay on his bed of soft moss and slept soundly. Then came the Fairies, merry but noiseless, bringing skillets and pots and dishes and pans and all the tools necessary to prepare food and to comfort a mortal.  With these they filled cupboard and fireplace, finally placing a stout suit of wool clothing on the stool by the bedside. When Claus awoke he rubbed his eyes again, and laughed, and spoke aloud his thanks to the Fairies and the Master Woodsman who had sent them. With eager joy he examined all his new possessions, wondering what some might be used for.  But, in the days when he had clung to the girdle of the great Ak and visited the cities of men, his eyes had been quick to note all the manners and customs of the race to which he belonged; so he guessed from the gifts brought by the Fairies that the Master expected him hereafter to live in the fashion of his fellow-creatures. 'Which means that I must plow the earth and plant corn,' he reflected; 'so that when winter comes I shall have garnered food in plenty.' But, as he stood in the grassy Valley, he saw that to turn up the earth in furrows would be to destroy hundreds of pretty, helpless flowers, as well as thousands of the tender blades of grass.  And this he could not bear to do. Therefore he stretched out his arms and uttered a peculiar whistle he had learned in the Forest, afterward crying: 'Ryls of the Field Flowers, come to me!' Instantly a dozen of the queer little Ryls were squatting upon the ground before him, and they nodded to him in cheerful greeting. Claus gazed upon them earnestly. 'Your brothers of the Forest,' he said, 'I have known and loved many years.  I shall love you, also, when we have become friends.  To me the laws of the Ryls, whether those of the Forest or of the field, are sacred.  I have never wilfully destroyed one of the flowers you tend so carefully; but I must plant grain to use for food during the cold winter, and how am I to do this without killing the little creatures that sing to me so prettily of their fragrant blossoms?' The Yellow Ryl, he who tends the buttercups, made answer: 'Fret not, friend Claus.  The great Ak has spoken to us of you.  There is better work for you in life than to labor for food, and though, not being of the Forest, Ak has no command over us, nevertheless are we glad to favor one he loves.  Live, therefore, to do the good work you are resolved to undertake.  We, the Field Ryls, will attend to your food supplies.' After this speech the Ryls were no longer to be seen, and Claus drove from his mind the thought of tilling the earth. When next he wandered back to his dwelling a bowl of fresh milk stood upon the table; bread was in the cupboard and sweet honey filled a dish beside it.  A pretty basket of rosy apples and new-plucked grapes was also awaiting him.  He called out 'Thanks, my friends!' to the invisible Ryls, and straightway began to eat of the food. Thereafter, when hungry, he had but to look into the cupboard to find goodly supplies brought by the kindly Ryls.  And the Knooks cut and stacked much wood for his fireplace.  And the Fairies brought him warm blankets and clothing. So began his life in the Laughing Valley, with the favor and friendship of the immortals to minister to his every want. 2.  How Claus Made the First Toy Truly our Claus had wisdom, for his good fortune but strengthened his resolve to befriend the little ones of his own race.  He knew his plan was approved by the immortals, else they would not have favored him so greatly. So he began at once to make acquaintance with mankind.  He walked through the Valley to the plain beyond, and crossed the plain in many directions to reach the abodes of men.  These stood singly or in groups of dwellings called villages, and in nearly all the houses, whether big or little, Claus found children. The youngsters soon came to know his merry, laughing face and the kind glance of his bright eyes; and the parents, while they regarded the young man with some scorn for loving children more than their elders, were content that the girls and boys had found a playfellow who seemed willing to amuse them. So the children romped and played games with Claus, and the boys rode upon his shoulders, and the girls nestled in his strong arms, and the babies clung fondly to his knees.  Wherever the young man chanced to be, the sound of childish laughter followed him; and to understand this better you must know that children were much neglected in those days and received little attention from their parents, so that it became to them a marvel that so goodly a man as Claus devoted his time to making them happy.  And those who knew him were, you may be sure, very happy indeed.  The sad faces of the poor and abused grew bright for once; the cripple smiled despite his misfortune; the ailing ones hushed their moans and the grieved ones their cries when their merry friend came nigh to comfort them. Only at the beautiful palace of the Lord of Lerd and at the frowning castle of the Baron Braun was Claus refused admittance.  There were children at both places; but the servants at the palace shut the door in the young stranger's face, and the fierce Baron threatened to hang him from an iron hook on the castle walls.  Whereupon Claus sighed and went back to the poorer dwellings where he was welcome. After a time the winter drew near. The flowers lived out their lives and faded and disappeared; the beetles burrowed far into the warm earth; the butterflies deserted the meadows; and the voice of the brook grew hoarse, as if it had taken cold. One day snowflakes filled all the air in the Laughing Valley, dancing boisterously toward the earth and clothing in pure white raiment the roof of Claus's dwelling. At night Jack Frost rapped at the door. 'Come in!' cried Claus. 'Come out!' answered Jack, 'for you have a fire inside.' So Claus came out.  He had known Jack Frost in the Forest, and liked the jolly rogue, even while he mistrusted him. 'There will be rare sport for me to-night, Claus!' shouted the sprite. 'Isn't this glorious weather?  I shall nip scores of noses and ears and toes before daybreak.' 'If you love me, Jack, spare the children,' begged Claus. 'And why?' asked the other, in surprise. 'They are tender and helpless,' answered Claus. 'But I love to nip the tender ones!' declared Jack.  'The older ones are tough, and tire my fingers.' 'The young ones are weak, and can not fight you,' said Claus. 'True,' agreed Jack, thoughtfully.  'Well, I will not pinch a child this night, if I can resist the temptation,' he promised.  'Good night, Claus!' 'Good night.' The young man went in and closed the door, and Jack Frost ran on to the nearest village. Claus threw a log on the fire, which burned up brightly.  Beside the hearth sat Blinkie, a big cat give him by Peter the Knook.  Her fur was soft and glossy, and she purred never-ending songs of contentment. 'I shall not see the children again soon,' said Claus to the cat, who kindly paused in her song to listen.  'The winter is upon us, the snow will be deep for many days, and I shall be unable to play with my little friends.' The cat raised a paw and stroked her nose thoughtfully, but made no reply.  So long as the fire burned and Claus sat in his easy chair by the hearth she did not mind the weather. So passed many days and many long evenings.  The cupboard was always full, but Claus became weary with having nothing to do more than to feed the fire from the big wood-pile the Knooks had brought him. One evening he picked up a stick of wood and began to cut it with his sharp knife.  He had no thought, at first, except to occupy his time, and he whistled and sang to the cat as he carved away portions of the stick.  Puss sat up on her haunches and watched him, listening at the same time to her master's merry whistle, which she loved to hear even more than her own purring songs. Claus glanced at puss and then at the stick he was whittling, until presently the wood began to have a shape, and the shape was like the head of a cat, with two ears sticking upward. Claus stopped whistling to laugh, and then both he and the cat looked at the wooden image in some surprise.  Then he carved out the eyes and the nose, and rounded the lower part of the head so that it rested upon a neck. Puss hardly knew what to make of it now, and sat up stiffly, as if watching with some suspicion what would come next. Claus knew.  The head gave him an idea.  He plied his knife carefully and with skill, forming slowly the body of the cat, which he made to sit upon its haunches as the real cat did, with her tail wound around her two front legs. The work cost him much time, but the evening was long and he had nothing better to do.  Finally he gave a loud and delighted laugh at the result of his labors and placed the wooden cat, now completed, upon the hearth opposite the real one. Puss thereupon glared at her image, raised her hair in anger, and uttered a defiant mew.  The wooden cat paid no attention, and Claus, much amused, laughed again. Then Blinkie advanced toward the wooden image to eye it closely and smell of it intelligently:  Eyes and nose told her the creature was wood, in spite of its natural appearance; so puss resumed her seat and her purring, but as she neatly washed her face with her padded paw she cast more than one admiring glance at her clever master.  Perhaps she felt the same satisfaction we feel when we look upon good photographs of ourselves. The cat's master was himself pleased with his handiwork, without knowing exactly why.  Indeed, he had great cause to congratulate himself that night, and all the children throughout the world should have joined him rejoicing.  For Claus had made his first toy. 3.  How the Ryls Colored the Toys A hush lay on the Laughing Valley now.  Snow covered it like a white spread and pillows of downy flakes drifted before the dwelling where Claus sat feeding the blaze of the fire.  The brook gurgled on beneath a heavy sheet of ice and all living plants and insects nestled close to Mother Earth to keep warm.  The face of the moon was hid by dark clouds, and the wind, delighting in the wintry sport, pushed and whirled the snowflakes in so many directions that they could get no chance to fall to the ground. Claus heard the wind whistling and shrieking in its play and thanked the good Knooks again for his comfortable shelter.  Blinkie washed her face lazily and stared at the coals with a look of perfect content. The toy cat sat opposite the real one and gazed straight ahead, as toy cats should. Suddenly Claus heard a noise that sounded different from the voice of the wind.  It was more like a wail of suffering and despair. He stood up and listened, but the wind, growing boisterous, shook the door and rattled the windows to distract his attention.  He waited until the wind was tired and then, still listening, he heard once more the shrill cry of distress. Quickly he drew on his coat, pulled his cap over his eyes and opened the door.  The wind dashed in and scattered the embers over the hearth, at the same time blowing Blinkie's fur so furiously that she crept under the table to escape.  Then the door was closed and Claus was outside, peering anxiously into the darkness. The wind laughed and scolded and tried to push him over, but he stood firm.  The helpless flakes stumbled against his eyes and dimmed his sight, but he rubbed them away and looked again.  Snow was everywhere, white and glittering.  It covered the earth and filled the air. The cry was not repeated. Claus turned to go back into the house, but the wind caught him unawares and he stumbled and fell across a snowdrift.  His hand plunged into the drift and touched something that was not snow.  This he seized and, pulling it gently toward him, found it to be a child. The next moment he had lifted it in his arms and carried it into the house. The wind followed him through the door, but Claus shut it out quickly. He laid the rescued child on the hearth, and brushing away the snow he discovered it to be Weekum, a little boy who lived in a house beyond the Valley. Claus wrapped a warm blanket around the little one and rubbed the frost from its limbs.  Before long the child opened his eyes and, seeing where he was, smiled happily.  Then Claus warmed milk and fed it to the boy slowly, while the cat looked on with sober curiosity.  Finally the little one curled up in his friend's arms and sighed and fell asleep, and Claus, filled with gladness that he had found the wanderer, held him closely while he slumbered. The wind, finding no more mischief to do, climbed the hill and swept on toward the north.  This gave the weary snowflakes time to settle down to earth, and the Valley became still again. The boy, having slept well in the arms of his friend, opened his eyes and sat up.  Then, as a child will, he looked around the room and saw all that it contained. 'Your cat is a nice cat, Claus,' he said, at last.  'Let me hold it.' But puss objected and ran away. 'The other cat won't run, Claus,' continued the boy.  'Let me hold that one.'  Claus placed the toy in his arms, and the boy held it lovingly and kissed the tip of its wooden ear. 'How did you get lost in the storm, Weekum?' asked Claus. 'I started to walk to my auntie's house and lost my way,' answered Weekum. 'Were you frightened?' 'It was cold,' said Weekum, 'and the snow got in my eyes, so I could not see.  Then I kept on till I fell in the snow, without knowing where I was, and the wind blew the flakes over me and covered me up.' Claus gently stroked his head, and the boy looked up at him and smiled. 'I'm all right now,' said Weekum. 'Yes,' replied Claus, happily.  'Now I will put you in my warm bed, and you must sleep until morning, when I will carry you back to your mother.' 'May the cat sleep with me?' asked the boy. 'Yes, if you wish it to,' answered Claus. 'It's a nice cat!' Weekum said, smiling, as Claus tucked the blankets around him; and presently the little one fell asleep with the wooden toy in his arms. When morning came the sun claimed the Laughing Valley and flooded it with his rays; so Claus prepared to take the lost child back to its mother. 'May I keep the cat, Claus?' asked Weekum.  'It's nicer than real cats. It doesn't run away, or scratch or bite.  May I keep it?' 'Yes, indeed,' answered Claus, pleased that the toy he had made could give pleasure to the child.  So he wrapped the boy and the wooden cat in a warm cloak, perching the bundle upon his own broad shoulders, and then he tramped through the snow and the drifts of the Valley and across the plain beyond to the poor cottage where Weekum's mother lived. 'See, mama!' cried the boy, as soon as they entered, 'I've got a cat!' The good woman wept tears of joy over the rescue of her darling and thanked Claus many times for his kind act.  So he carried a warm and happy heart back to his home in the Valley. That night he said to puss: 'I believe the children will love the wooden cats almost as well as the real ones, and they can't hurt them by pulling their tails and ears.  I'll make another.' So this was the beginning of his great work. The next cat was better made than the first.  While Claus sat whittling it out the Yellow Ryl came in to make him a visit, and so pleased was he with the man's skill that he ran away and brought several of his fellows. There sat the Red Ryl, the Black Ryl, the Green Ryl, the Blue Ryl and the Yellow Ryl in a circle on the floor, while Claus whittled and whistled and the wooden cat grew into shape. 'If it could be made the same color as the real cat, no one would know the difference,' said the Yellow Ryl, thoughtfully. 'The little ones, maybe, would not know the difference,' replied Claus, pleased with the idea. 'I will bring you some of the red that I color my roses and tulips with,' cried the Red Ryl; 'and then you can make the cat's lips and tongue red.' 'I will bring some of the green that I color my grasses and leaves with,' said the Green Ryl; 'and then you can color the cat's eyes green.' 'They will need a bit of yellow, also,' remarked the Yellow Ryl; 'I must fetch some of the yellow that I use to color my buttercups and goldenrods with.' 'The real cat is black,' said the Black Ryl; 'I will bring some of the black that I use to color the eyes of my pansies with, and then you can paint your wooden cat black.' 'I see you have a blue ribbon around Blinkie's neck,' added the Blue Ryl.  'I will get some of the color that I use to paint the bluebells and forget-me-nots with, and then you can carve a wooden ribbon on the toy cat's neck and paint it blue.' So the Ryls disappeared, and by the time Claus had finished carving out the form of the cat they were all back with the paints and brushes. They made Blinkie sit upon the table, that Claus might paint the toy cat just the right color, and when the work was done the Ryls declared it was exactly as good as a live cat. 'That is, to all appearances,' added the Red Ryl. Blinkie seemed a little offended by the attention bestowed upon the toy, and that she might not seem to approve the imitation cat she walked to the corner of the hearth and sat down with a dignified air. But Claus was delighted, and as soon as morning came he started out and tramped through the snow, across the Valley and the plain, until he came to a village.  There, in a poor hut near the walls of the beautiful palace of the Lord of Lerd, a little girl lay upon a wretched cot, moaning with pain. Claus approached the child and kissed her and comforted her, and then he drew the toy cat from beneath his coat, where he had hidden it, and placed it in her arms. Ah, how well he felt himself repaid for his labor and his long walk when he saw the little one's eyes grow bright with pleasure!  She hugged the kitty tight to her breast, as if it had been a precious gem, and would not let it go for a single moment.  The fever was quieted, the pain grew less, and she fell into a sweet and refreshing sleep. Claus laughed and whistled and sang all the way home.  Never had he been so happy as on that day. When he entered his house he found Shiegra, the lioness, awaiting him. Since his babyhood Shiegra had loved Claus, and while he dwelt in the Forest she had often come to visit him at Necile's bower.  After Claus had gone to live in the Laughing Valley Shiegra became lonely and ill at ease, and now she had braved the snow-drifts, which all lions abhor, to see him once more.  Shiegra was getting old and her teeth were beginning to fall out, while the hairs that tipped her ears and tail had changed from tawny-yellow to white. Claus found her lying on his hearth, and he put his arms around the neck of the lioness and hugged her lovingly.  The cat had retired into a far corner.  She did not care to associate with Shiegra. Claus told his old friend about the cats he had made, and how much pleasure they had given Weekum and the sick girl.  Shiegra did not know much about children; indeed, if she met a child she could scarcely be trusted not to devour it.  But she was interested in Claus' new labors, and said: 'These images seem to me very attractive.  Yet I can not see why you should make cats, which are very unimportant animals.  Suppose, now that I am here, you make the image of a lioness, the Queen of all beasts.  Then, indeed, your children will be happy, and safe at the same time!' Claus thought this was a good suggestion.  So he got a piece of wood and sharpened his knife, while Shiegra crouched upon the hearth at his feet.  With much care he carved the head in the likeness of the lioness, even to the two fierce teeth that curved over her lower lip and the deep, frowning lines above her wide-open eyes. When it was finished he said: 'You have a terrible look, Shiegra.' 'Then the image is like me,' she answered; 'for I am indeed terrible to all who are not my friends.' Claus now carved out the body, with Shiegra's long tail trailing behind it.  The image of the crouching lioness was very life-like. 'It pleases me,' said Shiegra, yawning and stretching her body gracefully.  'Now I will watch while you paint.' He brought the paints the Ryls had given him from the cupboard and colored the image to resemble the real Shiegra. The lioness placed her big, padded paws upon the edge of the table and raised herself while she carefully examined the toy that was her likeness. 'You are indeed skillful!' she said, proudly.  'The children will like that better than cats, I'm sure.' Then snarling at Blinkie, who arched her back in terror and whined fearfully, she walked away toward her forest home with stately strides. 4.  How Little Mayrie Became Frightened The winter was over now, and all the Laughing Valley was filled with joyous excitement.  The brook was so happy at being free once again that it gurgled more boisterously than ever and dashed so recklessly against the rocks that it sent showers of spray high in the air.  The grass thrust its sharp little blades upward through the mat of dead stalks where it had hidden from the snow, but the flowers were yet too timid to show themselves, although the Ryls were busy feeding their roots.  The sun was in remarkably good humor, and sent his rays dancing merrily throughout the Valley. Claus was eating his dinner one day when he heard a timid knock on his door. 'Come in!' he called. No one entered, but after a pause came another rapping. Claus jumped up and threw open the door.  Before him stood a small girl holding a smaller brother fast by the hand. 'Is you Tlaus?' she asked, shyly. 'Indeed I am, my dear!' he answered, with a laugh, as he caught both children in his arms and kissed them.  'You are very welcome, and you have come just in time to share my dinner.' He took them to the table and fed them with fresh milk and nut-cakes. When they had eaten enough he asked: 'Why have you made this long journey to see me?' 'I wants a tat!' replied little Mayrie; and her brother, who had not yet learned to speak many words, nodded his head and exclaimed like an echo: 'Tat!' 'Oh, you want my toy cats, do you?' returned Claus, greatly pleased to discover that his creations were so popular with children. The little visitors nodded eagerly. 'Unfortunately,' he continued, 'I have but one cat now ready, for I carried two to children in the town yesterday.  And the one I have shall be given to your brother, Mayrie, because he is the smaller; and the next one I make shall be for you.' The boy's face was bright with smiles as he took the precious toy Claus held out to him; but little Mayrie covered her face with her arm and began to sob grievously. 'I, I, I wants a t, t, tat now!' she wailed. Her disappointment made Claus feel miserable for a moment.  Then he suddenly remembered Shiegra. 'Don't cry, darling!' he said, soothingly; 'I have a toy much nicer than a cat, and you shall have that.' He went to the cupboard and drew out the image of the lioness, which he placed on the table before Mayrie. The girl raised her arm and gave one glance at the fierce teeth and glaring eyes of the beast, and then, uttering a terrified scream, she rushed from the house.  The boy followed her, also screaming lustily, and even dropping his precious cat in his fear. For a moment Claus stood motionless, being puzzled and astonished. Then he threw Shiegra's image into the cupboard and ran after the children, calling to them not to be frightened. Little Mayrie stopped in her flight and her brother clung to her skirt; but they both cast fearful glances at the house until Claus had assured them many times that the beast had been locked in the cupboard. 'Yet why were you frightened at seeing it?' he asked.  'It is only a toy to play with!' 'It's bad!' said Mayrie, decidedly, 'an', an', just horrid, an' not a bit nice, like tats!' 'Perhaps you are right,' returned Claus, thoughtfully.  'But if you will return with me to the house I will soon make you a pretty cat.' So they timidly entered the house again, having faith in their friend's words; and afterward they had the joy of watching Claus carve out a cat from a bit of wood and paint it in natural colors.  It did not take him long to do this, for he had become skillful with his knife by this time, and Mayrie loved her toy the more dearly because she had seen it made. After his little visitors had trotted away on their journey homeward Claus sat long in deep thought.  And he then decided that such fierce creatures as his friend the lioness would never do as models from which to fashion his toys. 'There must be nothing to frighten the dear babies,' he reflected; 'and while I know Shiegra well, and am not afraid of her, it is but natural that children should look upon her image with terror.  Hereafter I will choose such mild-mannered animals as squirrels and rabbits and deer and lambkins from which to carve my toys, for then the little ones will love rather than fear them.' He began his work that very day, and before bedtime had made a wooden rabbit and a lamb.  They were not quite so lifelike as the cats had been, because they were formed from memory, while Blinkie had sat very still for Claus to look at while he worked. But the new toys pleased the children nevertheless, and the fame of Claus' playthings quickly spread to every cottage on plain and in village.  He always carried his gifts to the sick or crippled children, but those who were strong enough walked to the house in the Valley to ask for them, so a little path was soon worn from the plain to the door of the toy-maker's cottage. First came the children who had been playmates of Claus, before he began to make toys.  These, you may be sure, were well supplied.  Then children who lived farther away heard of the wonderful images and made journeys to the Valley to secure them.  All little ones were welcome, and never a one went away empty-handed. This demand for his handiwork kept Claus busily occupied, but he was quite happy in knowing the pleasure he gave to so many of the dear children.  His friends the immortals were pleased with his success and supported him bravely. The Knooks selected for him clear pieces of soft wood, that his knife might not be blunted in cutting them; the Ryls kept him supplied with paints of all colors and brushes fashioned from the tips of timothy grasses; the Fairies discovered that the workman needed saws and chisels and hammers and nails, as well as knives, and brought him a goodly array of such tools. Claus soon turned his living room into a most wonderful workshop.  He built a bench before the window, and arranged his tools and paints so that he could reach everything as he sat on his stool.  And as he finished toy after toy to delight the hearts of little children he found himself growing so gay and happy that he could not refrain from singing and laughing and whistling all the day long. 'It's because I live in the Laughing Valley, where everything else laughs!' said Claus. But that was not the reason. 5.  How Bessie Blithesome Came to the Laughing Valley One day, as Claus sat before his door to enjoy the sunshine while he busily carved the head and horns of a toy deer, he looked up and discovered a glittering cavalcade of horsemen approaching through the Valley. When they drew nearer he saw that the band consisted of a score of men-at-arms, clad in bright armor and bearing in their hands spears and battle-axes.  In front of these rode little Bessie Blithesome, the pretty daughter of that proud Lord of Lerd who had once driven Claus from his palace.  Her palfrey was pure white, its bridle was covered with glittering gems, and its saddle draped with cloth of gold, richly broidered.  The soldiers were sent to protect her from harm while she journeyed. Claus was surprised, but he continued to whittle and to sing until the cavalcade drew up before him.  Then the little girl leaned over the neck of her palfrey and said: 'Please, Mr. Claus, I want a toy!' Her voice was so pleading that Claus jumped up at once and stood beside her.  But he was puzzled how to answer her request. 'You are a rich lord's daughter,' said he, 'and have all that you desire.' 'Except toys,' added Bessie.  'There are no toys in all the world but yours.' 'And I make them for the poor children, who have nothing else to amuse them,' continued Claus. 'Do poor children love to play with toys more than rich ones?' asked Bessie. 'I suppose not,' said Claus, thoughtfully. 'Am I to blame because my father is a lord?  Must I be denied the pretty toys I long for because other children are poorer than I?' she inquired earnestly. 'I'm afraid you must, dear,' he answered; 'for the poor have nothing else with which to amuse themselves.  You have your pony to ride, your servants to wait on you, and every comfort that money can procure.' 'But I want toys!' cried Bessie, wiping away the tears that forced themselves into her eyes.  'If I can not have them, I shall be very unhappy.' Claus was troubled, for her grief recalled to him the thought that his desire was to make all children happy, without regard to their condition in life.  Yet, while so many poor children were clamoring for his toys he could not bear to give one to them to Bessie Blithesome, who had so much already to make her happy. 'Listen, my child,' said he, gently; 'all the toys I am now making are promised to others.  But the next shall be yours, since your heart so longs for it.  Come to me again in two days and it shall be ready for you.' Bessie gave a cry of delight, and leaning over her pony's neck she kissed Claus prettily upon his forehead.  Then, calling to her men-at-arms, she rode gaily away, leaving Claus to resume his work. 'If I am to supply the rich children as well as the poor ones,' he thought, 'I shall not have a spare moment in the whole year!  But is it right I should give to the rich?  Surely I must go to Necile and talk with her about this matter.' So when he had finished the toy deer, which was very like a deer he had known in the Forest glades, he walked into Burzee and made his way to the bower of the beautiful Nymph Necile, who had been his foster mother. She greeted him tenderly and lovingly, listening with interest to his story of the visit of Bessie Blithesome. 'And now tell me,' said he, 'shall I give toys to rich children?' 'We of the Forest know nothing of riches,' she replied.  'It seems to me that one child is like another child, since they are all made of the same clay, and that riches are like a gown, which may be put on or taken away, leaving the child unchanged.  But the Fairies are guardians of mankind, and know mortal children better than I.  Let us call the Fairy Queen.' This was done, and the Queen of the Fairies sat beside them and heard Claus relate his reasons for thinking the rich children could get along without his toys, and also what the Nymph had said. 'Necile is right,' declared the Queen; 'for, whether it be rich or poor, a child's longings for pretty playthings are but natural.  Rich Bessie's heart may suffer as much grief as poor Mayrie's; she can be just as lonely and discontented, and just as gay and happy.  I think, friend Claus, it is your duty to make all little ones glad, whether they chance to live in palaces or in cottages.' 'Your words are wise, fair Queen,' replied Claus, 'and my heart tells me they are as just as they are wise.  Hereafter all children may claim my services.' Then he bowed before the gracious Fairy and, kissing Necile's red lips, went back into his Valley. At the brook he stopped to drink, and afterward he sat on the bank and took a piece of moist clay in his hands while he thought what sort of toy he should make for Bessie Blithesome.  He did not notice that his fingers were working the clay into shape until, glancing downward, he found he had unconsciously formed a head that bore a slight resemblance to the Nymph Necile! At once he became interested.  Gathering more of the clay from the bank he carried it to his house.  Then, with the aid of his knife and a bit of wood he succeeded in working the clay into the image of a toy nymph. With skillful strokes he formed long, waving hair on the head and covered the body with a gown of oakleaves, while the two feet sticking out at the bottom of the gown were clad in sandals. But the clay was soft, and Claus found he must handle it gently to avoid ruining his pretty work. 'Perhaps the rays of the sun will draw out the moisture and cause the clay to become hard,' he thought.  So he laid the image on a flat board and placed it in the glare of the sun. This done, he went to his bench and began painting the toy deer, and soon he became so interested in the work that he forgot all about the clay nymph.  But next morning, happening to notice it as it lay on the board, he found the sun had baked it to the hardness of stone, and it was strong enough to be safely handled. Claus now painted the nymph with great care in the likeness of Necile, giving it deep-blue eyes, white teeth, rosy lips and ruddy-brown hair. The gown he colored oak-leaf green, and when the paint was dry Claus himself was charmed with the new toy.  Of course it was not nearly so lovely as the real Necile; but, considering the material of which it was made, Claus thought it was very beautiful. When Bessie, riding upon her white palfrey, came to his dwelling next day, Claus presented her with the new toy.  The little girl's eyes were brighter than ever as she examined the pretty image, and she loved it at once, and held it close to her breast, as a mother does to her child. 'What is it called, Claus?' she asked. Now Claus knew that Nymphs do not like to be spoken of by mortals, so he could not tell Bessie it was an image of Necile he had given her. But as it was a new toy he searched his mind for a new name to call it by, and the first word he thought of he decided would do very well. 'It is called a dolly, my dear,' he said to Bessie. 'I shall call the dolly my baby,' returned Bessie, kissing it fondly; 'and I shall tend it and care for it just as Nurse cares for me.  Thank you very much, Claus; your gift has made me happier than I have ever been before!' Then she rode away, hugging the toy in her arms, and Claus, seeing her delight, thought he would make another dolly, better and more natural than the first. He brought more clay from the brook, and remembering that Bessie had called the dolly her baby he resolved to form this one into a baby's image.  That was no difficult task to the clever workman, and soon the baby dolly was lying on the board and placed in the sun to dry.  Then, with the clay that was left, he began to make an image of Bessie Blithesome herself. This was not so easy, for he found he could not make the silken robe of the lord's daughter out of the common clay.  So he called the Fairies to his aid, and asked them to bring him colored silks with which to make a real dress for the clay image.  The Fairies set off at once on their errand, and before nightfall they returned with a generous supply of silks and laces and golden threads. Claus now became impatient to complete his new dolly, and instead of waiting for the next day's sun he placed the clay image upon his hearth and covered it over with glowing coals.  By morning, when he drew the dolly from the ashes, it had baked as hard as if it had lain a full day in the hot sun. Now our Claus became a dressmaker as well as a toymaker.  He cut the lavender silk, and neaty sewed it into a beautiful gown that just fitted the new dolly.  And he put a lace collar around its neck and pink silk shoes on its feet.  The natural color of baked clay is a light gray, but Claus painted the face to resemble the color of flesh, and he gave the dolly Bessie's brown eyes and golden hair and rosy cheeks. It was really a beautiful thing to look upon, and sure to bring joy to some childish heart.  While Claus was admiring it he heard a knock at his door, and little Mayrie entered.  Her face was sad and her eyes red with continued weeping. 'Why, what has grieved you, my dear?' asked Claus, taking the child in his arms. 'I've, I've, bwoke my tat!' sobbed Mayrie. 'How?' he inquired, his eyes twinkling. 'I, I dwopped him, an' bwoke off him's tail; an', an', then I dwopped him an' bwoke off him's ear!  An', an' now him's all spoilt!' Claus laughed. 'Never mind, Mayrie dear,' he said.  'How would you like this new dolly, instead of a cat?' Mayrie looked at the silk-robed dolly and her eyes grew big with astonishment. 'Oh, Tlaus!' she cried, clapping her small hands together with rapture; 'tan I have 'at boo'ful lady?' 'Do you like it?' he asked. 'I love it!' said she.  'It's better 'an tats!' 'Then take it, dear, and be careful not to break it.' Mayrie took the dolly with a joy that was almost reverent, and her face dimpled with smiles as she started along the path toward home. 6.  The Wickedness of the Awgwas I must now tell you something about the Awgwas, that terrible race of creatures which caused our good Claus so much trouble and nearly succeeded in robbing the children of the world of their earliest and best friend. I do not like to mention the Awgwas, but they are a part of this history, and can not be ignored.  They were neither mortals nor immortals, but stood midway between those classes of beings.  The Awgwas were invisible to ordinary people, but not to immortals.  They could pass swiftly through the air from one part of the world to another, and had the power of influencing the minds of human beings to do their wicked will. They were of gigantic stature and had coarse, scowling countenances which showed plainly their hatred of all mankind.  They possessed no consciences whatever and delighted only in evil deeds. Their homes were in rocky, mountainous places, from whence they sallied forth to accomplish their wicked purposes. The one of their number that could think of the most horrible deed for them to do was always elected the King Awgwa, and all the race obeyed his orders.  Sometimes these creatures lived to become a hundred years old, but usually they fought so fiercely among themselves that many were destroyed in combat, and when they died that was the end of them. Mortals were powerless to harm them and the immortals shuddered when the Awgwas were mentioned, and always avoided them.  So they flourished for many years unopposed and accomplished much evil. I am glad to assure you that these vile creatures have long since perished and passed from earth; but in the days when Claus was making his first toys they were a numerous and powerful tribe. One of the principal sports of the Awgwas was to inspire angry passions in the hearts of little children, so that they quarreled and fought with one another.  They would tempt boys to eat of unripe fruit, and then delight in the pain they suffered; they urged little girls to disobey their parents, and then would laugh when the children were punished.  I do not know what causes a child to be naughty in these days, but when the Awgwas were on earth naughty children were usually under their influence. Now, when Claus began to make children happy he kept them out of the power of the Awgwas; for children possessing such lovely playthings as he gave them had no wish to obey the evil thoughts the Awgwas tried to thrust into their minds. Therefore, one year when the wicked tribe was to elect a new King, they chose an Awgwa who proposed to destroy Claus and take him away from the children. 'There are, as you know, fewer naughty children in the world since Claus came to the Laughing Valley and began to make his toys,' said the new King, as he squatted upon a rock and looked around at the scowling faces of his people.  'Why, Bessie Blithesome has not stamped her foot once this month, nor has Mayrie's brother slapped his sister's face or thrown the puppy into the rain-barrel.  Little Weekum took his bath last night without screaming or struggling, because his mother had promised he should take his toy cat to bed with him!  Such a condition of affairs is awful for any Awgwa to think of, and the only way we can direct the naughty actions of children is to take this person Claus away from them.' 'Good! good!' cried the big Awgwas, in a chorus, and they clapped their hands to applaud the speech of the King. 'But what shall we do with him?' asked one of the creatures. 'I have a plan,' replied the wicked King; and what his plan was you will soon discover. That night Claus went to bed feeling very happy, for he had completed no less than four pretty toys during the day, and they were sure, he thought, to make four little children happy.  But while he slept the band of invisible Awgwas surrounded his bed, bound him with stout cords, and then flew away with him to the middle of a dark forest in far off Ethop, where they laid him down and left him. When morning came Claus found himself thousands of miles from any human being, a prisoner in the wild jungle of an unknown land. From the limb of a tree above his head swayed a huge python, one of those reptiles that are able to crush a man's bones in their coils.  A few yards away crouched a savage panther, its glaring red eyes fixed full on the helpless Claus.  One of those monstrous spotted spiders whose sting is death crept stealthily toward him over the matted leaves, which shriveled and turned black at its very touch. But Claus had been reared in Burzee, and was not afraid. 'Come to me, ye Knooks of the Forest!' he cried, and gave the low, peculiar whistle that the Knooks know. The panther, which was about to spring upon its victim, turned and slunk away.  The python swung itself into the tree and disappeared among the leaves.  The spider stopped short in its advance and hid beneath a rotting log. Claus had no time to notice them, for he was surrounded by a band of harsh-featured Knooks, more crooked and deformed in appearance than any he had ever seen. 'Who are you that call on us?' demanded one, in a gruff voice. 'The friend of your brothers in Burzee,' answered Claus.  'I have been brought here by my enemies, the Awgwas, and left to perish miserably. Yet now I implore your help to release me and to send me home again.' 'Have you the sign?' asked another. 'Yes,' said Claus. They cut his bonds, and with his free arms he made the secret sign of the Knooks. Instantly they assisted him to stand upon his feet, and they brought him food and drink to strengthen him. 'Our brothers of Burzee make queer friends,' grumbled an ancient Knook whose flowing beard was pure white.  'But he who knows our secret sign and signal is entitled to our help, whoever he may be.  Close your eyes, stranger, and we will conduct you to your home.  Where shall we seek it?' ''Tis in the Laughing Valley,' answered Claus, shutting his eyes. 'There is but one Laughing Valley in the known world, so we can not go astray,' remarked the Knook. As he spoke the sound of his voice seemed to die away, so Claus opened his eyes to see what caused the change.  To his astonishment he found himself seated on the bench by his own door, with the Laughing Valley spread out before him.  That day he visited the Wood-Nymphs and related his adventure to Queen Zurline and Necile. 'The Awgwas have become your enemies,' said the lovely Queen, thoughtfully; 'so we must do all we can to protect you from their power.' 'It was cowardly to bind him while he slept,' remarked Necile, with indignation. 'The evil ones are ever cowardly,' answered Zurline, 'but our friend's slumber shall not be disturbed again.' The Queen herself came to the dwelling of Claus that evening and placed her Seal on every door and window, to keep out the Awgwas.  And under the Seal of Queen Zurline was placed the Seal of the Fairies and the Seal of the Ryls and the Seals of the Knooks, that the charm might become more powerful. And Claus carried his toys to the children again, and made many more of the little ones happy. You may guess how angry the King Awgwa and his fierce band were when it was known to them that Claus had escaped from the Forest of Ethop. They raged madly for a whole week, and then held another meeting among the rocks. 'It is useless to carry him where the Knooks reign,' said the King, 'for he has their protection.  So let us cast him into a cave of our own mountains, where he will surely perish.' This was promptly agreed to, and the wicked band set out that night to seize Claus.  But they found his dwelling guarded by the Seals of the Immortals and were obliged to go away baffled and disappointed. 'Never mind,' said the King; 'he does not sleep always!' Next day, as Claus traveled to the village across the plain, where he intended to present a toy squirrel to a lame boy, he was suddenly set upon by the Awgwas, who seized him and carried him away to the mountains. There they thrust him within a deep cavern and rolled many huge rocks against the entrance to prevent his escape. Deprived thus of light and food, and with little air to breathe, our Claus was, indeed, in a pitiful plight.  But he spoke the mystic words of the Fairies, which always command their friendly aid, and they came to his rescue and transported him to the Laughing Valley in the twinkling of an eye. Thus the Awgwas discovered they might not destroy one who had earned the friendship of the immortals; so the evil band sought other means of keeping Claus from bringing happiness to children and so making them obedient. Whenever Claus set out to carry his toys to the little ones an Awgwa, who had been set to watch his movements, sprang upon him and snatched the toys from his grasp.  And the children were no more disappointed than was Claus when he was obliged to return home disconsolate.  Still he persevered, and made many toys for his little friends and started with them for the villages.  And always the Awgwas robbed him as soon as he had left the Valley. They threw the stolen playthings into one of their lonely caverns, and quite a heap of toys accumulated before Claus became discouraged and gave up all attempts to leave the Valley.  Then children began coming to him, since they found he did not go to them; but the wicked Awgwas flew around them and caused their steps to stray and the paths to become crooked, so never a little one could find a way into the Laughing Valley. Lonely days now fell upon Claus, for he was denied the pleasure of bringing happiness to the children whom he had learned to love.  Yet he bore up bravely, for he thought surely the time would come when the Awgwas would abandon their evil designs to injure him. He devoted all his hours to toy-making, and when one plaything had been completed he stood it on a shelf he had built for that purpose.  When the shelf became filled with rows of toys he made another one, and filled that also.  So that in time he had many shelves filled with gay and beautiful toys representing horses, dogs, cats, elephants, lambs, rabbits and deer, as well as pretty dolls of all sizes and balls and marbles of baked clay painted in gay colors. Often, as he glanced at this array of childish treasures, the heart of good old Claus became sad, so greatly did he long to carry the toys to his children.  And at last, because he could bear it no longer, he ventured to go to the great Ak, to whom he told the story of his persecution by the Awgwas, and begged the Master Woodsman to assist him. 7.  The Great Battle Between Good and Evil Ak listened gravely to the recital of Claus, stroking his beard the while with the slow, graceful motion that betokened deep thought.  He nodded approvingly when Claus told how the Knooks and Fairies had saved him from death, and frowned when he heard how the Awgwas had stolen the children's toys.  At last he said: 'From the beginning I have approved the work you are doing among the children of men, and it annoys me that your good deeds should be thwarted by the Awgwas.  We immortals have no connection whatever with the evil creatures who have attacked you.  Always have we avoided them, and they, in turn, have hitherto taken care not to cross our pathway. But in this matter I find they have interfered with one of our friends, and I will ask them to abandon their persecutions, as you are under our protection.' Claus thanked the Master Woodsman most gratefully and returned to his Valley, while Ak, who never delayed carrying out his promises, at once traveled to the mountains of the Awgwas. There, standing on the bare rocks, he called on the King and his people to appear. Instantly the place was filled with throngs of the scowling Awgwas, and their King, perching himself on a point of rock, demanded fiercely: 'Who dares call on us?' 'It is I, the Master Woodsman of the World,' responded Ak. 'Here are no forests for you to claim,' cried the King, angrily.  'We owe no allegiance to you, nor to any immortal!' 'That is true,' replied Ak, calmly.  'Yet you have ventured to interfere with the actions of Claus, who dwells in the Laughing Valley, and is under our protection.' Many of the Awgwas began muttering at this speech, and their King turned threateningly on the Master Woodsman. 'You are set to rule the forests, but the plains and the valleys are ours!' he shouted.  'Keep to your own dark woods!  We will do as we please with Claus.' 'You shall not harm our friend in any way!' replied Ak. 'Shall we not?' asked the King, impudently.  'You will see!  Our powers are vastly superior to those of mortals, and fully as great as those of immortals.' 'It is your conceit that misleads you!' said Ak, sternly.  'You are a transient race, passing from life into nothingness.  We, who live forever, pity but despise you.  On earth you are scorned by all, and in Heaven you have no place!  Even the mortals, after their earth life, enter another existence for all time, and so are your superiors.  How then dare you, who are neither mortal nor immortal, refuse to obey my wish?' The Awgwas sprang to their feet with menacing gestures, but their King motioned them back. 'Never before,' he cried to Ak, while his voice trembled with rage, 'has an immortal declared himself the master of the Awgwas!  Never shall an immortal venture to interfere with our actions again!  For we will avenge your scornful words by killing your friend Claus within three days.  Nor you, nor all the immortals can save him from our wrath.  We defy your powers!  Begone, Master Woodsman of the World!  In the country of the Awgwas you have no place.' 'It is war!' declared Ak, with flashing eyes. 'It is war!' returned the King, savagely.  'In three days your friend will be dead.' The Master turned away and came to his Forest of Burzee, where he called a meeting of the immortals and told them of the defiance of the Awgwas and their purpose to kill Claus within three days. The little folk listened to him quietly. 'What shall we do?' asked Ak. 'These creatures are of no benefit to the world,' said the Prince of the Knooks; 'we must destroy them.' 'Their lives are devoted only to evil deeds,' said the Prince of the Ryls.  'We must destroy them.' 'They have no conscience, and endeavor to make all mortals as bad as themselves,' said the Queen of the Fairies.  'We must destroy them.' 'They have defied the great Ak, and threaten the life of our adopted son,' said beautiful Queen Zurline.  'We must destroy them.' The Master Woodsman smiled. 'You speak well,' said he.  'These Awgwas we know to be a powerful race, and they will fight desperately; yet the outcome is certain.  For we who live can never die, even though conquered by our enemies, while every Awgwa who is struck down is one foe the less to oppose us. Prepare, then, for battle, and let us resolve to show no mercy to the wicked!' Thus arose that terrible war between the immortals and the spirits of evil which is sung of in Fairyland to this very day. The King Awgwa and his band determined to carry out the threat to destroy Claus.  They now hated him for two reasons: he made children happy and was a friend of the Master Woodsman.  But since Ak's visit they had reason to fear the opposition of the immortals, and they dreaded defeat.  So the King sent swift messengers to all parts of the world to summon every evil creature to his aid. And on the third day after the declaration of war a mighty army was at the command of the King Awgwa.  There were three hundred Asiatic Dragons, breathing fire that consumed everything it touched.  These hated mankind and all good spirits.  And there were the three-eyed Giants of Tatary, a host in themselves, who liked nothing better than to fight.  And next came the Black Demons from Patalonia, with great spreading wings like those of a bat, which swept terror and misery through the world as they beat upon the air.  And joined to these were the Goozzle-Goblins, with long talons as sharp as swords, with which they clawed the flesh from their foes.  Finally, every mountain Awgwa in the world had come to participate in the great battle with the immortals. The King Awgwa looked around upon this vast army and his heart beat high with wicked pride, for he believed he would surely triumph over his gentle enemies, who had never before been known to fight.  But the Master Woodsman had not been idle.  None of his people was used to warfare, yet now that they were called upon to face the hosts of evil they willingly prepared for the fray. Ak had commanded them to assemble in the Laughing Valley, where Claus, ignorant of the terrible battle that was to be waged on his account, was quietly making his toys. Soon the entire Valley, from hill to hill, was filled with the little immortals.  The Master Woodsman stood first, bearing a gleaming ax that shone like burnished silver.  Next came the Ryls, armed with sharp thorns from bramblebushes.  Then the Knooks, bearing the spears they used when they were forced to prod their savage beasts into submission. The Fairies, dressed in white gauze with rainbow-hued wings, bore golden wands, and the Wood-nymphs, in their uniforms of oak-leaf green, carried switches from ash trees as weapons. Loud laughed the Awgwa King when he beheld the size and the arms of his foes.  To be sure the mighty ax of the Woodsman was to be dreaded, but the sweet-faced Nymphs and pretty Fairies, the gentle Ryls and crooked Knooks were such harmless folk that he almost felt shame at having called such a terrible host to oppose them. 'Since these fools dare fight,' he said to the leader of the Tatary Giants, 'I will overwhelm them with our evil powers!' To begin the battle he poised a great stone in his left hand and cast it full against the sturdy form of the Master Woodsman, who turned it aside with his ax.  Then rushed the three-eyed Giants of Tatary upon the Knooks, and the Goozzle-Goblins upon the Ryls, and the firebreathing Dragons upon the sweet Fairies.  Because the Nymphs were Ak's own people the band of Awgwas sought them out, thinking to overcome them with ease. But it is the Law that while Evil, unopposed, may accomplish terrible deeds, the powers of Good can never be overthrown when opposed to Evil. Well had it been for the King Awgwa had he known the Law! His ignorance cost him his existence, for one flash of the ax borne by the Master Woodsman of the World cleft the wicked King in twain and rid the earth of the vilest creature it contained. Greatly marveled the Tatary Giants when the spears of the little Knooks pierced their thick walls of flesh and sent them reeling to the ground with howls of agony. Woe came upon the sharp-taloned Goblins when the thorns of the Ryls reached their savage hearts and let their life-blood sprinkle all the plain.  And afterward from every drop a thistle grew. The Dragons paused astonished before the Fairy wands, from whence rushed a power that caused their fiery breaths to flow back on themselves so that they shriveled away and died. As for the Awgwas, they had scant time to realize how they were destroyed, for the ash switches of the Nymphs bore a charm unknown to any Awgwa, and turned their foes into clods of earth at the slightest touch! When Ak leaned upon his gleaming ax and turned to look over the field of battle he saw the few Giants who were able to run disappearing over the distant hills on their return to Tatary.  The Goblins had perished every one, as had the terrible Dragons, while all that remained of the wicked Awgwas was a great number of earthen hillocks dotting the plain. And now the immortals melted from the Valley like dew at sunrise, to resume their duties in the Forest, while Ak walked slowly and thoughtfully to the house of Claus and entered. 'You have many toys ready for the children,' said the Woodsman, 'and now you may carry them across the plain to the dwellings and the villages without fear.' 'Will not the Awgwas harm me?' asked Claus, eagerly. 'The Awgwas,' said Ak, 'have perished!' Now I will gladly have done with wicked spirits and with fighting and bloodshed.  It was not from choice that I told of the Awgwas and their allies, and of their great battle with the immortals.  They were part of this history, and could not be avoided. 8.  The First Journey with the Reindeer Those were happy days for Claus when he carried his accumulation of toys to the children who had awaited them so long.  During his imprisonment in the Valley he had been so industrious that all his shelves were filled with playthings, and after quickly supplying the little ones living near by he saw he must now extend his travels to wider fields. Remembering the time when he had journeyed with Ak through all the world, he knew children were everywhere, and he longed to make as many as possible happy with his gifts. So he loaded a great sack with all kinds of toys, slung it upon his back that he might carry it more easily, and started off on a longer trip than he had yet undertaken. Wherever he showed his merry face, in hamlet or in farmhouse, he received a cordial welcome, for his fame had spread into far lands.  At each village the children swarmed about him, following his footsteps wherever he went; and the women thanked him gratefully for the joy he brought their little ones; and the men looked upon him curiously that he should devote his time to such a queer occupation as toy-making. But every one smiled on him and gave him kindly words, and Claus felt amply repaid for his long journey. When the sack was empty he went back again to the Laughing Valley and once more filled it to the brim.  This time he followed another road, into a different part of the country, and carried happiness to many children who never before had owned a toy or guessed that such a delightful plaything existed. After a third journey, so far away that Claus was many days walking the distance, the store of toys became exhausted and without delay he set about making a fresh supply. From seeing so many children and studying their tastes he had acquired several new ideas about toys. The dollies were, he had found, the most delightful of all playthings for babies and little girls, and often those who could not say 'dolly' would call for a 'doll' in their sweet baby talk.  So Claus resolved to make many dolls, of all sizes, and to dress them in bright-colored clothing.  The older boys, and even some of the girls, loved the images of animals, so he still made cats and elephants and horses.  And many of the little fellows had musical natures, and longed for drums and cymbals and whistles and horns.  So he made a number of toy drums, with tiny sticks to beat them with; and he made whistles from the willow trees, and horns from the bog-reeds, and cymbals from bits of beaten metal. All this kept him busily at work, and before he realized it the winter season came, with deeper snows than usual, and he knew he could not leave the Valley with his heavy pack.  Moreover, the next trip would take him farther from home than every before, and Jack Frost was mischievous enough to nip his nose and ears if he undertook the long journey while the Frost King reigned.  The Frost King was Jack's father and never reproved him for his pranks. So Claus remained at his work-bench; but he whistled and sang as merrily as ever, for he would allow no disappointment to sour his temper or make him unhappy. One bright morning he looked from his window and saw two of the deer he had known in the Forest walking toward his house. Claus was surprised; not that the friendly deer should visit him, but that they walked on the surface of the snow as easily as if it were solid ground, notwithstanding the fact that throughout the Valley the snow lay many feet deep.  He had walked out of his house a day or two before and had sunk to his armpits in a drift. So when the deer came near he opened the door and called to them: 'Good morning, Flossie!  Tell me how you are able to walk on the snow so easily.' 'It is frozen hard,' answered Flossie. 'The Frost King has breathed on it,' said Glossie, coming up, 'and the surface is now as solid as ice.' 'Perhaps,' remarked Claus, thoughtfully, 'I might now carry my pack of toys to the children.' 'Is it a long journey?' asked Flossie. 'Yes; it will take me many days, for the pack is heavy,' answered Claus. 'Then the snow would melt before you could get back,' said the deer. 'You must wait until spring, Claus.' Claus sighed.  'Had I your fleet feet,' said he, 'I could make the journey in a day.' 'But you have not,' returned Glossie, looking at his own slender legs with pride. 'Perhaps I could ride upon your back,' Claus ventured to remark, after a pause. 'Oh no; our backs are not strong enough to bear your weight,' said Flossie, decidedly.  'But if you had a sledge, and could harness us to it, we might draw you easily, and your pack as well.' 'I'll make a sledge!' exclaimed Claus.  'Will you agree to draw me if I do?' 'Well,' replied Flossie, 'we must first go and ask the Knooks, who are our guardians, for permission; but if they consent, and you can make a sledge and harness, we will gladly assist you.' 'Then go at once!' cried Claus, eagerly.  'I am sure the friendly Knooks will give their consent, and by the time you are back I shall be ready to harness you to my sledge.' Flossie and Glossie, being deer of much intelligence, had long wished to see the great world, so they gladly ran over the frozen snow to ask the Knooks if they might carry Claus on his journey. Meantime the toy-maker hurriedly began the construction of a sledge, using material from his wood-pile.  He made two long runners that turned upward at the front ends, and across these nailed short boards, to make a platform.  It was soon completed, but was as rude in appearance as it is possible for a sledge to be. The harness was more difficult to prepare, but Claus twisted strong cords together and knotted them so they would fit around the necks of the deer, in the shape of a collar.  From these ran other cords to fasten the deer to the front of the sledge. Before the work was completed Glossie and Flossie were back from the Forest, having been granted permission by Will Knook to make the journey with Claus provided they would to Burzee by daybreak the next morning. 'That is not a very long time,' said Flossie; 'but we are swift and strong, and if we get started by this evening we can travel many miles during the night.' Claus decided to make the attempt, so he hurried on his preparations as fast as possible.  After a time he fastened the collars around the necks of his steeds and harnessed them to his rude sledge.  Then he placed a stool on the little platform, to serve as a seat, and filled a sack with his prettiest toys. 'How do you intend to guide us?' asked Glossie.  'We have never been out of the Forest before, except to visit your house, so we shall not know the way.' Claus thought about that for a moment.  Then he brought more cords and fastened two of them to the spreading antlers of each deer, one on the right and the other on the left. 'Those will be my reins,' said Claus, 'and when I pull them to the right or to the left you must go in that direction.  If I do not pull the reins at all you may go straight ahead.' 'Very well,' answered Glossie and Flossie; and then they asked: 'Are you ready?' Claus seated himself upon the stool, placed the sack of toys at his feet, and then gathered up the reins. 'All ready!' he shouted; 'away we go!' The deer leaned forward, lifted their slender limbs, and the next moment away flew the sledge over the frozen snow.  The swiftness of the motion surprised Claus, for in a few strides they were across the Valley and gliding over the broad plain beyond. The day had melted into evening by the time they started; for, swiftly as Claus had worked, many hours had been consumed in making his preparations.  But the moon shone brightly to light their way, and Claus soon decided it was just as pleasant to travel by night as by day. The deer liked it better; for, although they wished to see something of the world, they were timid about meeting men, and now all the dwellers in the towns and farmhouses were sound asleep and could not see them. Away and away they sped, on and on over the hills and through the valleys and across the plains until they reached a village where Claus had never been before. Here he called on them to stop, and they immediately obeyed.  But a new difficulty now presented itself, for the people had locked their doors when they went to bed, and Claus found he could not enter the houses to leave his toys. 'I am afraid, my friends, we have made our journey for nothing,' said he, 'for I shall be obliged to carry my playthings back home again without giving them to the children of this village.' 'What's the matter?' asked Flossie. 'The doors are locked,' answered Claus, 'and I can not get in.' Glossie looked around at the houses.  The snow was quite deep in that village, and just before them was a roof only a few feet above the sledge.  A broad chimney, which seemed to Glossie big enough to admit Claus, was at the peak of the roof. 'Why don't you climb down that chimney?' asked Glossie. Claus looked at it. 'That would be easy enough if I were on top of the roof,' he answered. 'Then hold fast and we will take you there,' said the deer, and they gave one bound to the roof and landed beside the big chimney. 'Good!' cried Claus, well pleased, and he slung the pack of toys over his shoulder and got into the chimney. There was plenty of soot on the bricks, but he did not mind that, and by placing his hands and knees against the sides he crept downward until he had reached the fireplace.  Leaping lightly over the smoldering coals he found himself in a large sitting-room, where a dim light was burning. From this room two doorways led into smaller chambers.  In one a woman lay asleep, with a baby beside her in a crib. Claus laughed, but he did not laugh aloud for fear of waking the baby. Then he slipped a big doll from his pack and laid it in the crib.  The little one smiled, as if it dreamed of the pretty plaything it was to find on the morrow, and Claus crept softly from the room and entered at the other doorway. Here were two boys, fast asleep with their arms around each other's neck.  Claus gazed at them lovingly a moment and then placed upon the bed a drum, two horns and a wooden elephant. He did not linger, now that his work in this house was done, but climbed the chimney again and seated himself on his sledge. 'Can you find another chimney?' he asked the reindeer. 'Easily enough,' replied Glossie and Flossie. Down to the edge of the roof they raced, and then, without pausing, leaped through the air to the top of the next building, where a huge, old-fashioned chimney stood. 'Don't be so long, this time,' called Flossie, 'or we shall never get back to the Forest by daybreak.' Claus made a trip down this chimney also and found five children sleeping in the house, all of whom were quickly supplied with toys. When he returned the deer sprang to the next roof, but on descending the chimney Claus found no children there at all.  That was not often the case in this village, however, so he lost less time than you might suppose in visiting the dreary homes where there were no little ones. When he had climbed down the chimneys of all the houses in that village, and had left a toy for every sleeping child, Claus found that his great sack was not yet half emptied. 'Onward, friends!' he called to the deer; 'we must seek another village.' So away they dashed, although it was long past midnight, and in a surprisingly short time they came to a large city, the largest Claus had ever visited since he began to make toys.  But, nothing daunted by the throng of houses, he set to work at once and his beautiful steeds carried him rapidly from one roof to another, only the highest being beyond the leaps of the agile deer. At last the supply of toys was exhausted and Claus seated himself in the sledge, with the empty sack at his feet, and turned the heads of Glossie and Flossie toward home. Presently Flossie asked: 'What is that gray streak in the sky?' 'It is the coming dawn of day,' answered Claus, surprised to find that it was so late. 'Good gracious!' exclaimed Glossie; 'then we shall not be home by daybreak, and the Knooks will punish us and never let us come again.' 'We must race for the Laughing Valley and make our best speed,' returned Flossie; 'so hold fast, friend Claus!' Claus held fast and the next moment was flying so swiftly over the snow that he could not see the trees as they whirled past.  Up hill and down dale, swift as an arrow shot from a bow they dashed, and Claus shut his eyes to keep the wind out of them and left the deer to find their own way. It seemed to him they were plunging through space, but he was not at all afraid.  The Knooks were severe masters, and must be obeyed at all hazards, and the gray streak in the sky was growing brighter every moment. Finally the sledge came to a sudden stop and Claus, who was taken unawares, tumbled from his seat into a snowdrift.  As he picked himself up he heard the deer crying: 'Quick, friend, quick!  Cut away our harness!' He drew his knife and rapidly severed the cords, and then he wiped the moisture from his eyes and looked around him. The sledge had come to a stop in the Laughing Valley, only a few feet, he found, from his own door.  In the East the day was breaking, and turning to the edge of Burzee he saw Glossie and Flossie just disappearing in the Forest. 9.  'Santa Claus!' Claus thought that none of the children would ever know where the toys came from which they found by their bedsides when they wakened the following morning.  But kindly deeds are sure to bring fame, and fame has many wings to carry its tidings into far lands; so for miles and miles in every direction people were talking of Claus and his wonderful gifts to children.  The sweet generousness of his work caused a few selfish folk to sneer, but even these were forced to admit their respect for a man so gentle-natured that he loved to devote his life to pleasing the helpless little ones of his race. Therefore the inhabitants of every city and village had been eagerly watching the coming of Claus, and remarkable stories of his beautiful playthings were told the children to keep them patient and contented. When, on the morning following the first trip of Claus with his deer, the little ones came running to their parents with the pretty toys they had found, and asked from whence they came, they was but one reply to the question. 'The good Claus must have been here, my darlings; for his are the only toys in all the world!' 'But how did he get in?' asked the children. At this the fathers shook their heads, being themselves unable to understand how Claus had gained admittance to their homes; but the mothers, watching the glad faces of their dear ones, whispered that the good Claus was no mortal man but assuredly a Saint, and they piously blessed his name for the happiness he had bestowed upon their children. 'A Saint,' said one, with bowed head, 'has no need to unlock doors if it pleases him to enter our homes.' And, afterward, when a child was naughty or disobedient, its mother would say: 'You must pray to the good Santa Claus for forgiveness.  He does not like naughty children, and, unless you repent, he will bring you no more pretty toys.' But Santa Claus himself would not have approved this speech.  He brought toys to the children because they were little and helpless, and because he loved them.  He knew that the best of children were sometimes naughty, and that the naughty ones were often good.  It is the way with children, the world over, and he would not have changed their natures had he possessed the power to do so. And that is how our Claus became Santa Claus.  It is possible for any man, by good deeds, to enshrine himself as a Saint in the hearts of the people. 10.  Christmas Eve The day that broke as Claus returned from his night ride with Glossie and Flossie brought to him a new trouble.  Will Knook, the chief guardian of the deer, came to him, surly and ill-tempered, to complain that he had kept Glossie and Flossie beyond daybreak, in opposition to his orders. 'Yet it could not have been very long after daybreak,' said Claus. 'It was one minute after,' answered Will Knook, 'and that is as bad as one hour.  I shall set the stinging gnats on Glossie and Flossie, and they will thus suffer terribly for their disobedience.' 'Don't do that!' begged Claus.  'It was my fault.' But Will Knook would listen to no excuses, and went away grumbling and growling in his ill-natured way. For this reason Claus entered the Forest to consult Necile about rescuing the good deer from punishment.  To his delight he found his old friend, the Master Woodsman, seated in the circle of Nymphs. Ak listened to the story of the night journey to the children and of the great assistance the deer had been to Claus by drawing his sledge over the frozen snow. 'I do not wish my friends to be punished if I can save them,' said the toy-maker, when he had finished the relation.  'They were only one minute late, and they ran swifter than a bird flies to get home before daybreak.' Ak stroked his beard thoughtfully a moment, and then sent for the Prince of the Knooks, who rules all his people in Burzee, and also for the Queen of the Fairies and the Prince of the Ryls. When all had assembled Claus told his story again, at Ak's command, and then the Master addressed the Prince of the Knooks, saying: 'The good work that Claus is doing among mankind deserves the support of every honest immortal.  Already he is called a Saint in some of the towns, and before long the name of Santa Claus will be lovingly known in every home that is blessed with children.  Moreover, he is a son of our Forest, so we owe him our encouragement.  You, Ruler of the Knooks, have known him these many years; am I not right in saying he deserves our friendship?' The Prince, crooked and sour of visage as all Knooks are, looked only upon the dead leaves at his feet and muttered: 'You are the Master Woodsman of the World!' Ak smiled, but continued, in soft tones: 'It seems that the deer which are guarded by your people can be of great assistance to Claus, and as they seem willing to draw his sledge I beg that you will permit him to use their services whenever he pleases.' The Prince did not reply, but tapped the curled point of his sandal with the tip of his spear, as if in thought. Then the Fairy Queen spoke to him in this way: 'If you consent to Ak's request I will see that no harm comes to your deer while they are away from the Forest.' And the Prince of the Ryls added: 'For my part I will allow to every deer that assists Claus the privilege of eating my casa plants, which give strength, and my grawle plants, which give fleetness of foot, and my marbon plants, which give long life.' And the Queen of the Nymphs said: 'The deer which draw the sledge of Claus will be permitted to bathe in the Forest pool of Nares, which will give them sleek coats and wonderful beauty.' The Prince of the Knooks, hearing these promises, shifted uneasily on his seat, for in his heart he hated to refuse a request of his fellow immortals, although they were asking an unusual favor at his hands, and the Knooks are unaccustomed to granting favors of any kind.  Finally he turned to his servants and said: 'Call Will Knook.' When surly Will came and heard the demands of the immortals he protested loudly against granting them. 'Deer are deer,' said he, 'and nothing but deer.  Were they horses it would be right to harness them like horses.  But no one harnesses deer because they are free, wild creatures, owing no service of any sort to mankind.  It would degrade my deer to labor for Claus, who is only a man in spite of the friendship lavished on him by the immortals.' 'You have heard,' said the Prince to Ak.  'There is truth in what Will says.' 'Call Glossie and Flossie,' returned the Master. The deer were brought to the conference and Ak asked them if they objected to drawing the sledge for Claus. 'No, indeed!' replied Glossie; 'we enjoyed the trip very much.' 'And we tried to get home by daybreak,' added Flossie, 'but were unfortunately a minute too late.' 'A minute lost at daybreak doesn't matter,' said Ak.  'You are forgiven for that delay.' 'Provided it does not happen again,' said the Prince of the Knooks, sternly. 'And will you permit them to make another journey with me?' asked Claus, eagerly. The Prince reflected while he gazed at Will, who was scowling, and at the Master Woodsman, who was smiling. Then he stood up and addressed the company as follows: 'Since you all urge me to grant the favor I will permit the deer to go with Claus once every year, on Christmas Eve, provided they always return to the Forest by daybreak.  He may select any number he pleases, up to ten, to draw his sledge, and those shall be known among us as Reindeer, to distinguish them from the others.  And they shall bathe in the Pool of Nares, and eat the casa and grawle and marbon plants and shall be under the especial protection of the Fairy Queen.  And now cease scowling, Will Knook, for my words shall be obeyed!' He hobbled quickly away through the trees, to avoid the thanks of Claus and the approval of the other immortals, and Will, looking as cross as ever, followed him. But Ak was satisfied, knowing that he could rely on the promise of the Prince, however grudgingly given; and Glossie and Flossie ran home, kicking up their heels delightedly at every step. 'When is Christmas Eve?' Claus asked the Master. 'In about ten days,' he replied. 'Then I can not use the deer this year,' said Claus, thoughtfully, 'for I shall not have time enough to make my sackful of toys.' 'The shrewd Prince foresaw that,' responded Ak, 'and therefore named Christmas Eve as the day you might use the deer, knowing it would cause you to lose an entire year.' 'If I only had the toys the Awgwas stole from me,' said Claus, sadly, 'I could easily fill my sack for the children.' 'Where are they?' asked the Master. 'I do not know,' replied Claus, 'but the wicked Awgwas probably hid them in the mountains.' Ak turned to the Fairy Queen. 'Can you find them?' he asked. 'I will try,' she replied, brightly. Then Claus went back to the Laughing Valley, to work as hard as he could, and a band of Fairies immediately flew to the mountain that had been haunted by the Awgwas and began a search for the stolen toys. The Fairies, as we well know, possess wonderful powers; but the cunning Awgwas had hidden the toys in a deep cave and covered the opening with rocks, so no one could look in.  Therefore all search for the missing playthings proved in vain for several days, and Claus, who sat at home waiting for news from the Fairies, almost despaired of getting the toys before Christmas Eve. He worked hard every moment, but it took considerable time to carve out and to shape each toy and to paint it properly, so that on the morning before Christmas Eve only half of one small shelf above the window was filled with playthings ready for the children. But on this morning the Fairies who were searching in the mountains had a new thought.  They joined hands and moved in a straight line through the rocks that formed the mountain, beginning at the topmost peak and working downward, so that no spot could be missed by their bright eyes. And at last they discovered the cave where the toys had been heaped up by the wicked Awgwas. It did not take them long to burst open the mouth of the cave, and then each one seized as many toys as he could carry and they all flew to Claus and laid the treasure before him. The good man was rejoiced to receive, just in the nick of time, such a store of playthings with which to load his sledge, and he sent word to Glossie and Flossie to be ready for the journey at nightfall. With all his other labors he had managed to find time, since the last trip, to repair the harness and to strengthen his sledge, so that when the deer came to him at twilight he had no difficulty in harnessing them. 'We must go in another direction to-night,' he told them, 'where we shall find children I have never yet visited.  And we must travel fast and work quickly, for my sack is full of toys and running over the brim!' So, just as the moon arose, they dashed out of the Laughing Valley and across the plain and over the hills to the south.  The air was sharp and frosty and the starlight touched the snowflakes and made them glitter like countless diamonds.  The reindeer leaped onward with strong, steady bounds, and Claus' heart was so light and merry that he laughed and sang while the wind whistled past his ears:      'With a ho, ho, ho!       And a ha, ha, ha!   And a ho, ho! ha, ha, hee!       Now away we go       O'er the frozen snow,   As merry as we can be!' Jack Frost heard him and came racing up with his nippers, but when he saw it was Claus he laughed and turned away again. The mother owls heard him as he passed near a wood and stuck their heads out of the hollow places in the tree-trunks; but when they saw who it was they whispered to the owlets nestling near them that it was only Santa Claus carrying toys to the children.  It is strange how much those mother owls know. Claus stopped at some of the scattered farmhouses and climbed down the chimneys to leave presents for the babies.  Soon after he reached a village and worked merrily for an hour distributing playthings among the sleeping little ones.  Then away again he went, signing his joyous carol:      'Now away we go       O'er the gleaming snow,   While the deer run swift and free!       For to girls and boys       We carry the toys   That will fill their hearts with glee!' The deer liked the sound of his deep bass voice and kept time to the song with their hoofbeats on the hard snow; but soon they stopped at another chimney and Santa Claus, with sparkling eyes and face brushed red by the wind, climbed down its smoky sides and left a present for every child the house contained. It was a merry, happy night.  Swiftly the deer ran, and busily their driver worked to scatter his gifts among the sleeping children. But the sack was empty at last, and the sledge headed homeward; and now again the race with daybreak began.  Glossie and Flossie had no mind to be rebuked a second time for tardiness, so they fled with a swiftness that enabled them to pass the gale on which the Frost King rode, and soon brought them to the Laughing Valley. It is true when Claus released his steeds from their harness the eastern sky was streaked with gray, but Glossie and Flossie were deep in the Forest before day fairly broke. Claus was so wearied with his night's work that he threw himself upon his bed and fell into a deep slumber, and while he slept the Christmas sun appeared in the sky and shone upon hundreds of happy homes where the sound of childish laughter proclaimed that Santa Claus had made them a visit. God bless him!  It was his first Christmas Eve, and for hundreds of years since then he has nobly fulfilled his mission to bring happiness to the hearts of little children. 11.  How the First Stockings Were Hung by the Chimneys When you remember that no child, until Santa Claus began his travels, had ever known the pleasure of possessing a toy, you will understand how joy crept into the homes of those who had been favored with a visit from the good man, and how they talked of him day by day in loving tones and were honestly grateful for his kindly deeds.  It is true that great warriors and mighty kings and clever scholars of that day were often spoken of by the people; but no one of them was so greatly beloved as Santa Claus, because none other was so unselfish as to devote himself to making others happy.  For a generous deed lives longer than a great battle or a king's decree of a scholar's essay, because it spreads and leaves its mark on all nature and endures through many generations. The bargain made with the Knook Prince changed the plans of Claus for all future time; for, being able to use the reindeer on but one night of each year, he decided to devote all the other days to the manufacture of playthings, and on Christmas Eve to carry them to the children of the world. But a year's work would, he knew, result in a vast accumulation of toys, so he resolved to build a new sledge that would be larger and stronger and better-fitted for swift travel than the old and clumsy one. His first act was to visit the Gnome King, with whom he made a bargain to exchange three drums, a trumpet and two dolls for a pair of fine steel runners, curled beautifully at the ends.  For the Gnome King had children of his own, who, living in the hollows under the earth, in mines and caverns, needed something to amuse them. In three days the steel runners were ready, and when Claus brought the playthings to the Gnome King, his Majesty was so greatly pleased with them that he presented Claus with a string of sweet-toned sleigh-bells, in addition to the runners. 'These will please Glossie and Flossie,' said Claus, as he jingled the bells and listened to their merry sound.  'But I should have two strings of bells, one for each deer.' 'Bring me another trumpet and a toy cat,' replied the King, 'and you shall have a second string of bells like the first.' 'It is a bargain!' cried Claus, and he went home again for the toys. The new sledge was carefully built, the Knooks bringing plenty of strong but thin boards to use in its construction.  Claus made a high, rounding dash-board to keep off the snow cast behind by the fleet hoofs of the deer; and he made high sides to the platform so that many toys could be carried, and finally he mounted the sledge upon the slender steel runners made by the Gnome King. It was certainly a handsome sledge, and big and roomy.  Claus painted it in bright colors, although no one was likely to see it during his midnight journeys, and when all was finished he sent for Glossie and Flossie to come and look at it. The deer admired the sledge, but gravely declared it was too big and heavy for them to draw. 'We might pull it over the snow, to be sure,' said Glossie; 'but we would not pull it fast enough to enable us to visit the far-away cities and villages and return to the Forest by daybreak.' 'Then I must add two more deer to my team,' declared Claus, after a moment's thought. 'The Knook Prince allowed you as many as ten.  Why not use them all?' asked Flossie.  'Then we could speed like the lightning and leap to the highest roofs with ease.' 'A team of ten reindeer!' cried Claus, delightedly.  'That will be splendid.  Please return to the Forest at once and select eight other deer as like yourselves as possible.  And you must all eat of the casa plant, to become strong, and of the grawle plant, to become fleet of foot, and of the marbon plant, that you may live long to accompany me on my journeys.  Likewise it will be well for you to bathe in the Pool of Nares, which the lovely Queen Zurline declares will render you rarely beautiful.  Should you perform these duties faithfully there is no doubt that on next Christmas Eve my ten reindeer will be the most powerful and beautiful steeds the world has ever seen!' So Glossie and Flossie went to the Forest to choose their mates, and Claus began to consider the question of a harness for them all. In the end he called upon Peter Knook for assistance, for Peter's heart is as kind as his body is crooked, and he is remarkably shrewd, as well.  And Peter agreed to furnish strips of tough leather for the harness. This leather was cut from the skins of lions that had reached such an advanced age that they died naturally, and on one side was tawny hair while the other side was cured to the softness of velvet by the deft Knooks.  When Claus received these strips of leather he sewed them neatly into a harness for the ten reindeer, and it proved strong and serviceable and lasted him for many years. The harness and sledge were prepared at odd times, for Claus devoted most of his days to the making of toys.  These were now much better than the first ones had been, for the immortals often came to his house to watch him work and to offer suggestions.  It was Necile's idea to make some of the dolls say 'papa' and 'mama.'  It was a thought of the Knooks to put a squeak inside the lambs, so that when a child squeezed them they would say 'baa-a-a-a!'  And the Fairy Queen advised Claus to put whistles in the birds, so they could be made to sing, and wheels on the horses, so children could draw them around.  Many animals perished in the Forest, from one cause or another, and their fur was brought to Claus that he might cover with it the small images of beasts he made for playthings.  A merry Ryl suggested that Claus make a donkey with a nodding head, which he did, and afterward found that it amused the little ones immensely.  And so the toys grew in beauty and attractiveness every day, until they were the wonder of even the immortals. When another Christmas Eve drew near there was a monster load of beautiful gifts for the children ready to be loaded upon the big sledge.  Claus filled three sacks to the brim, and tucked every corner of the sledge-box full of toys besides. Then, at twilight, the ten reindeer appeared and Flossie introduced them all to Claus.  They were Racer and Pacer, Reckless and Speckless, Fearless and Peerless, and Ready and Steady, who, with Glossie and Flossie, made up the ten who have traversed the world these hundreds of years with their generous master.  They were all exceedingly beautiful, with slender limbs, spreading antlers, velvety dark eyes and smooth coats of fawn color spotted with white. Claus loved them at once, and has loved them ever since, for they are loyal friends and have rendered him priceless service. The new harness fitted them nicely and soon they were all fastened to the sledge by twos, with Glossie and Flossie in the lead.  These wore the strings of sleigh-bells, and were so delighted with the music they made that they kept prancing up and down to make the bells ring. Claus now seated himself in the sledge, drew a warm robe over his knees and his fur cap over his ears, and cracked his long whip as a signal to start. Instantly the ten leaped forward and were away like the wind, while jolly Claus laughed gleefully to see them run and shouted a song in his big, hearty voice:       'With a ho, ho, ho!       And a ha, ha, ha!   And a ho, ho, ha, ha, hee!       Now away we go       O'er the frozen snow,   As merry as we can be!       There are many joys       In our load of toys,   As many a child will know;       We'll scatter them wide       On our wild night ride   O'er the crisp and sparkling snow!' Now it was on this same Christmas Eve that little Margot and her brother Dick and her cousins Ned and Sara, who were visiting at Margot's house, came in from making a snow man, with their clothes damp, their mittens dripping and their shoes and stockings wet through and through.  They were not scolded, for Margot's mother knew the snow was melting, but they were sent early to bed that their clothes might be hung over chairs to dry.  The shoes were placed on the red tiles of the hearth, where the heat from the hot embers would strike them, and the stockings were carefully hung in a row by the chimney, directly over the fireplace.  That was the reason Santa Claus noticed them when he came down the chimney that night and all the household were fast asleep.  He was in a tremendous hurry and seeing the stockings all belonged to children he quickly stuffed his toys into them and dashed up the chimney again, appearing on the roof so suddenly that the reindeer were astonished at his agility. 'I wish they would all hang up their stockings,' he thought, as he drove to the next chimney.  'It would save me a lot of time and I could then visit more children before daybreak.' When Margot and Dick and Ned and Sara jumped out of bed next morning and ran downstairs to get their stockings from the fireplace they were filled with delight to find the toys from Santa Claus inside them.  In face, I think they found more presents in their stockings than any other children of that city had received, for Santa Claus was in a hurry and did not stop to count the toys. Of course they told all their little friends about it, and of course every one of them decided to hang his own stockings by the fireplace the next Christmas Eve.  Even Bessie Blithesome, who made a visit to that city with her father, the great Lord of Lerd, heard the story from the children and hung her own pretty stockings by the chimney when she returned home at Christmas time. On his next trip Santa Claus found so many stockings hung up in anticipation of his visit that he could fill them in a jiffy and be away again in half the time required to hunt the children up and place the toys by their bedsides. The custom grew year after year, and has always been a great help to Santa Claus.  And, with so many children to visit, he surely needs all the help we are able to give him. 12.  The First Christmas Tree Claus had always kept his promise to the Knooks by returning to the Laughing Valley by daybreak, but only the swiftness of his reindeer has enabled him to do this, for he travels over all the world. He loved his work and he loved the brisk night ride on his sledge and the gay tinkle of the sleigh-bells.  On that first trip with the ten reindeer only Glossie and Flossie wore bells; but each year thereafter for eight years Claus carried presents to the children of the Gnome King, and that good-natured monarch gave him in return a string of bells at each visit, so that finally every one of the ten deer was supplied, and you may imagine what a merry tune the bells played as the sledge sped over the snow. The children's stockings were so long that it required a great many toys to fill them, and soon Claus found there were other things besides toys that children love.  So he sent some of the Fairies, who were always his good friends, into the Tropics, from whence they returned with great bags full of oranges and bananas which they had plucked from the trees.  And other Fairies flew to the wonderful Valley of Phunnyland, where delicious candies and bonbons grow thickly on the bushes, and returned laden with many boxes of sweetmeats for the little ones.  These things Santa Claus, on each Christmas Eve, placed in the long stockings, together with his toys, and the children were glad to get them, you may be sure. There are also warm countries where there is no snow in winter, but Claus and his reindeer visited them as well as the colder climes, for there were little wheels inside the runners of his sledge which permitted it to run as smoothly over bare ground as on the snow.  And the children who lived in the warm countries learned to know the name of Santa Claus as well as those who lived nearer to the Laughing Valley. Once, just as the reindeer were ready to start on their yearly trip, a Fairy came to Claus and told him of three little children who lived beneath a rude tent of skins on a broad plain where there were no trees whatever.  These poor babies were miserable and unhappy, for their parents were ignorant people who neglected them sadly.  Claus resolved to visit these children before he returned home, and during his ride he picked up the bushy top of a pine tree which the wind had broken off and placed it in his sledge. It was nearly morning when the deer stopped before the lonely tent of skins where the poor children lay asleep.  Claus at once planted the bit of pine tree in the sand and stuck many candles on the branches. Then he hung some of his prettiest toys on the tree, as well as several bags of candies.  It did not take long to do all this, for Santa Claus works quickly, and when all was ready he lighted the candles and, thrusting his head in at the opening of the tent, he shouted: 'Merry Christmas, little ones!' With that he leaped into his sledge and was out of sight before the children, rubbing the sleep from their eyes, could come out to see who had called them. You can imagine the wonder and joy of those little ones, who had never in their lives known a real pleasure before, when they saw the tree, sparkling with lights that shone brilliant in the gray dawn and hung with toys enough to make them happy for years to come!  They joined hands and danced around the tree, shouting and laughing, until they were obliged to pause for breath.  And their parents, also, came out to look and wonder, and thereafter had more respect and consideration for their children, since Santa Claus had honored them with such beautiful gifts. The idea of the Christmas tree pleased Claus, and so the following year he carried many of them in his sledge and set them up in the homes of poor people who seldom saw trees, and placed candles and toys on the branches.  Of course he could not carry enough trees in one load of all who wanted them, but in some homes the fathers were able to get trees and have them all ready for Santa Claus when he arrived; and these the good Claus always decorated as prettily as possible and hung with toys enough for all the children who came to see the tree lighted. These novel ideas and the generous manner in which they were carried out made the children long for that one night in the year when their friend Santa Claus should visit them, and as such anticipation is very pleasant and comforting the little ones gleaned much happiness by wondering what would happen when Santa Claus next arrived. Perhaps you remember that stern Baron Braun who once drove Claus from his castle and forbade him to visit his children?  Well, many years afterward, when the old Baron was dead and his son ruled in his place, the new Baron Braun came to the house of Claus with his train of knights and pages and henchmen and, dismounting from his charger, bared his head humbly before the friend of children. 'My father did not know your goodness and worth,' he said, 'and therefore threatened to hang you from the castle walls.  But I have children of my own, who long for a visit from Santa Claus, and I have come to beg that you will favor them hereafter as you do other children.' Claus was pleased with this speech, for Castle Braun was the only place he had never visited, and he gladly promised to bring presents to the Baron's children the next Christmas Eve. The Baron went away contented, and Claus kept his promise faithfully. Thus did this man, through very goodness, conquer the hearts of all; and it is no wonder he was ever merry and gay, for there was no home in the wide world where he was not welcomed more royally than any king. OLD AGE 1.  The Mantle of Immortality And now we come to a turning-point in the career of Santa Claus, and it is my duty to relate the most remarkable that has happened since the world began or mankind was created. We have followed the life of Claus from the time he was found a helpless infant by the Wood-Nymph Necile and reared to manhood in the great Forest of Burzee.  And we know how he began to make toys for children and how, with the assistance and goodwill of the immortals, he was able to distribute them to the little ones throughout the world. For many years he carried on this noble work; for the simple, hard-working life he led gave him perfect health and strength.  And doubtless a man can live longer in the beautiful Laughing Valley, where there are no cares and everything is peaceful and merry, than in any other part of the world. But when many years had rolled away Santa Claus grew old.  The long beard of golden brown that once covered his cheeks and chin gradually became gray, and finally turned to pure white.  His hair was white, too, and there were wrinkles at the corners of his eyes, which showed plainly when he laughed.  He had never been a very tall man, and now he became fat, and waddled very much like a duck when he walked.  But in spite of these things he remained as lively as ever, and was just as jolly and gay, and his kind eyes sparkled as brightly as they did that first day when he came to the Laughing Valley. Yet a time is sure to come when every mortal who has grown old and lived his life is required to leave this world for another; so it is no wonder that, after Santa Claus had driven his reindeer on many and many a Christmas Eve, those stanch friends finally whispered among themselves that they had probably drawn his sledge for the last time. Then all the Forest of Burzee became sad and all the Laughing Valley was hushed; for every living thing that had known Claus had used to love him and to brighten at the sound of his footsteps or the notes of his merry whistle. No doubt the old man's strength was at last exhausted, for he made no more toys, but lay on his bed as in a dream. The Nymph Necile, she who had reared him and been his foster-mother, was still youthful and strong and beautiful, and it seemed to her but a short time since this aged, gray-bearded man had lain in her arms and smiled on her with his innocent, baby lips. In this is shown the difference between mortals and immortals. It was fortunate that the great Ak came to the Forest at this time. Necile sought him with troubled eyes and told him of the fate that threatened their friend Claus. At once the Master became grave, and he leaned upon his ax and stroked his grizzled beard thoughtfully for many minutes.  Then suddenly he stood up straight, and poised his powerful head with firm resolve, and stretched out his great right arm as if determined on doing some mighty deed.  For a thought had come to him so grand in its conception that all the world might well bow before the Master Woodsman and honor his name forever! It is well known that when the great Ak once undertakes to do a thing he never hesitates an instant.  Now he summoned his fleetest messengers, and sent them in a flash to many parts of the earth.  And when they were gone he turned to the anxious Necile and comforted her, saying: 'Be of good heart, my child; our friend still lives.  And now run to your Queen and tell her that I have summoned a council of all the immortals of the world to meet with me here in Burzee this night.  If they obey, and harken unto my words, Claus will drive his reindeer for countless ages yet to come.' At midnight there was a wondrous scene in the ancient Forest of Burzee, where for the first time in many centuries the rulers of the immortals who inhabit the earth were gathered together. There was the Queen of the Water Sprites, whose beautiful form was as clear as crystal but continually dripped water on the bank of moss where she sat.  And beside her was the King of the Sleep Fays, who carried a wand from the end of which a fine dust fell all around, so that no mortal could keep awake long enough to see him, as mortal eyes were sure to close in sleep as soon as the dust filled them.  And next to him sat the Gnome King, whose people inhabit all that region under the earth's surface, where they guard the precious metals and the jewel stones that lie buried in rock and ore.  At his right hand stood the King of the Sound Imps, who had wings on his feet, for his people are swift to carry all sounds that are made.  When they are busy they carry the sounds but short distances, for there are many of them; but sometimes they speed with the sounds to places miles and miles away from where they are made.  The King of the Sound Imps had an anxious and careworn face, for most people have no consideration for his Imps and, especially the boys and girls, make a great many unnecessary sounds which the Imps are obliged to carry when they might be better employed. The next in the circle of immortals was the King of the Wind Demons, slender of frame, restless and uneasy at being confined to one place for even an hour.  Once in a while he would leave his place and circle around the glade, and each time he did this the Fairy Queen was obliged to untangle the flowing locks of her golden hair and tuck them back of her pink ears.  But she did not complain, for it was not often that the King of the Wind Demons came into the heart of the Forest.  After the Fairy Queen, whose home you know was in old Burzee, came the King of the Light Elves, with his two Princes, Flash and Twilight, at his back. He never went anywhere without his Princes, for they were so mischievous that he dared not let them wander alone. Prince Flash bore a lightning-bolt in his right hand and a horn of gunpowder in his left, and his bright eyes roved constantly around, as if he longed to use his blinding flashes.  Prince Twilight held a great snuffer in one hand and a big black cloak in the other, and it is well known that unless Twilight is carefully watched the snuffers or the cloak will throw everything into darkness, and Darkness is the greatest enemy the King of the Light Elves has. In addition to the immortals I have named were the King of the Knooks, who had come from his home in the jungles of India; and the King of the Ryls, who lived among the gay flowers and luscious fruits of Valencia. Sweet Queen Zurline of the Wood-Nymphs completed the circle of immortals. But in the center of the circle sat three others who possessed powers so great that all the Kings and Queens showed them reverence. These were Ak, the Master Woodsman of the World, who rules the forests and the orchards and the groves; and Kern, the Master Husbandman of the World, who rules the grain fields and the meadows and the gardens; and Bo, the Master Mariner of the World, who rules the seas and all the craft that float thereon.  And all other immortals are more or less subject to these three. When all had assembled the Master Woodsman of the World stood up to address them, since he himself had summoned them to the council. Very clearly he told them the story of Claus, beginning at the time when as a babe he had been adopted a child of the Forest, and telling of his noble and generous nature and his life-long labors to make children happy. 'And now,' said Ak, 'when he had won the love of all the world, the Spirit of Death is hovering over him.  Of all men who have inhabited the earth none other so well deserves immortality, for such a life can not be spared so long as there are children of mankind to miss him and to grieve over his loss.  We immortals are the servants of the world, and to serve the world we were permitted in the Beginning to exist. But what one of us is more worthy of immortality than this man Claus, who so sweetly ministers to the little children?' He paused and glanced around the circle, to find every immortal listening to him eagerly and nodding approval.  Finally the King of the Wind Demons, who had been whistling softly to himself, cried out: 'What is your desire, O Ak?' 'To bestow upon Claus the Mantle of Immortality!' said Ak, boldly. That this demand was wholly unexpected was proved by the immortals springing to their feet and looking into each other's face with dismay and then upon Ak with wonder.  For it was a grave matter, this parting with the Mantle of Immortality. The Queen of the Water Sprites spoke in her low, clear voice, and the words sounded like raindrops splashing upon a window-pane. 'In all the world there is but one Mantle of Immortality,' she said. The King of the Sound Fays added: 'It has existed since the Beginning, and no mortal has ever dared to claim it.' And the Master Mariner of the World arose and stretched his limbs, saying: 'Only by the vote of every immortal can it be bestowed upon a mortal.' 'I know all this,' answered Ak, quietly.  'But the Mantle exists, and if it was created, as you say, in the Beginning, it was because the Supreme Master knew that some day it would be required.  Until now no mortal has deserved it, but who among you dares deny that the good Claus deserves it?  Will you not all vote to bestow it upon him?' They were silent, still looking upon one another questioningly. 'Of what use is the Mantle of Immortality unless it is worn?' demanded Ak.  'What will it profit any one of us to allow it to remain in its lonely shrine for all time to come?' 'Enough!' cried the Gnome King, abruptly.  'We will vote on the matter, yes or no.  For my part, I say yes!' 'And I!' said the Fairy Queen, promptly, and Ak rewarded her with a smile. 'My people in Burzee tell me they have learned to love him; therefore I vote to give Claus the Mantle,' said the King of the Ryls. 'He is already a comrade of the Knooks,' announced the ancient King of that band.  'Let him have immortality!' 'Let him have it, let him have it!' sighed the King of the Wind Demons. 'Why not?' asked the King of the Sleep Fays.  'He never disturbs the slumbers my people allow humanity.  Let the good Claus be immortal!' 'I do not object,' said the King of the Sound Imps. 'Nor I,' murmured the Queen of the Water Sprites. 'If Claus does not receive the Mantle it is clear none other can ever claim it,' remarked the King of the Light Elves, 'so let us have done with the thing for all time.' 'The Wood-Nymphs were first to adopt him,' said Queen Zurline.  'Of course I shall vote to make him immortal.' Ak now turned to the Master Husbandman of the World, who held up his right arm and said 'Yes!' And the Master Mariner of the World did likewise, after which Ak, with sparkling eyes and smiling face, cried out: 'I thank you, fellow immortals!  For all have voted 'yes,' and so to our dear Claus shall fall the one Mantle of Immortality that it is in our power to bestow!' 'Let us fetch it at once,' said the Fay King; 'I'm in a hurry.' They bowed assent, and instantly the Forest glade was deserted.  But in a place midway between the earth and the sky was suspended a gleaming crypt of gold and platinum, aglow with soft lights shed from the facets of countless gems.  Within a high dome hung the precious Mantle of Immortality, and each immortal placed a hand on the hem of the splendid Robe and said, as with one voice: 'We bestow this Mantle upon Claus, who is called the Patron Saint of Children!' At this the Mantle came away from its lofty crypt, and they carried it to the house in the Laughing Valley. The Spirit of Death was crouching very near to the bedside of Claus, and as the immortals approached she sprang up and motioned them back with an angry gesture.  But when her eyes fell upon the Mantle they bore she shrank away with a low moan of disappointment and quitted that house forever. Softly and silently the immortal Band dropped upon Claus the precious Mantle, and it closed about him and sank into the outlines of his body and disappeared from view.  It became a part of his being, and neither mortal nor immortal might ever take it from him. Then the Kings and Queens who had wrought this great deed dispersed to their various homes, and all were well contented that they had added another immortal to their Band. And Claus slept on, the red blood of everlasting life coursing swiftly through his veins; and on his brow was a tiny drop of water that had fallen from the ever-melting gown of the Queen of the Water Sprites, and over his lips hovered a tender kiss that had been left by the sweet Nymph Necile.  For she had stolen in when the others were gone to gaze with rapture upon the immortal form of her foster son. 2.  When the World Grew Old The next morning, when Santa Claus opened his eyes and gazed around the familiar room, which he had feared he might never see again, he was astonished to find his old strength renewed and to feel the red blood of perfect health coursing through his veins.  He sprang from his bed and stood where the bright sunshine came in through his window and flooded him with its merry, dancing rays.  He did not then understand what had happened to restore to him the vigor of youth, but in spite of the fact that his beard remained the color of snow and that wrinkles still lingered in the corners of his bright eyes, old Santa Claus felt as brisk and merry as a boy of sixteen, and was soon whistling contentedly as he busied himself fashioning new toys. Then Ak came to him and told of the Mantle of Immortality and how Claus had won it through his love for little children. It made old Santa look grave for a moment to think he had been so favored; but it also made him glad to realize that now he need never fear being parted from his dear ones.  At once he began preparations for making a remarkable assortment of pretty and amusing playthings, and in larger quantities than ever before; for now that he might always devote himself to this work he decided that no child in the world, poor or rich, should hereafter go without a Christmas gift if he could manage to supply it. The world was new in the days when dear old Santa Claus first began toy-making and won, by his loving deeds, the Mantle of Immortality. And the task of supplying cheering words, sympathy and pretty playthings to all the young of his race did not seem a difficult undertaking at all.  But every year more and more children were born into the world, and these, when they grew up, began spreading slowly over all the face of the earth, seeking new homes; so that Santa Claus found each year that his journeys must extend farther and farther from the Laughing Valley, and that the packs of toys must be made larger and ever larger. So at length he took counsel with his fellow immortals how his work might keep pace with the increasing number of children that none might be neglected.  And the immortals were so greatly interested in his labors that they gladly rendered him their assistance.  Ak gave him his man Kilter, 'the silent and swift.'  And the Knook Prince gave him Peter, who was more crooked and less surly than any of his brothers. And the Ryl Prince gave him Nuter, the sweetest tempered Ryl ever known.  And the Fairy Queen gave him Wisk, that tiny, mischievous but lovable Fairy who knows today almost as many children as does Santa Claus himself. With these people to help make the toys and to keep his house in order and to look after the sledge and the harness, Santa Claus found it much easier to prepare his yearly load of gifts, and his days began to follow one another smoothly and pleasantly. Yet after a few generations his worries were renewed, for it was remarkable how the number of people continued to grow, and how many more children there were every year to be served.  When the people filled all the cities and lands of one country they wandered into another part of the world; and the men cut down the trees in many of the great forests that had been ruled by Ak, and with the wood they built new cities, and where the forests had been were fields of grain and herds of browsing cattle. You might think the Master Woodsman would rebel at the loss of his forests; but not so.  The wisdom of Ak was mighty and farseeing. 'The world was made for men,' said he to Santa Claus, 'and I have but guarded the forests until men needed them for their use.  I am glad my strong trees can furnish shelter for men's weak bodies, and warm them through the cold winters.  But I hope they will not cut down all the trees, for mankind needs the shelter of the woods in summer as much as the warmth of blazing logs in winter.  And, however crowded the world may grow, I do not think men will ever come to Burzee, nor to the Great Black Forest, nor to the wooded wilderness of Braz; unless they seek their shades for pleasure and not to destroy their giant trees.' By and by people made ships from the tree-trunks and crossed over oceans and built cities in far lands; but the oceans made little difference to the journeys of Santa Claus.  His reindeer sped over the waters as swiftly as over land, and his sledge headed from east to west and followed in the wake of the sun.  So that as the earth rolled slowly over Santa Claus had all of twenty-four hours to encircle it each Christmas Eve, and the speedy reindeer enjoyed these wonderful journeys more and more. So year after year, and generation after generation, and century after century, the world grew older and the people became more numerous and the labors of Santa Claus steadily increased.  The fame of his good deeds spread to every household where children dwelt.  And all the little ones loved him dearly; and the fathers and mothers honored him for the happiness he had given them when they too were young; and the aged grandsires and granddames remembered him with tender gratitude and blessed his name. 3.  The Deputies of Santa Claus However, there was one evil following in the path of civilization that caused Santa Claus a vast amount of trouble before he discovered a way to overcome it.  But, fortunately, it was the last trial he was forced to undergo. One Christmas Eve, when his reindeer had leaped to the top of a new building, Santa Claus was surprised to find that the chimney had been built much smaller than usual.  But he had no time to think about it just then, so he drew in his breath and made himself as small as possible and slid down the chimney. 'I ought to be at the bottom by this time,' he thought, as he continued to slip downward; but no fireplace of any sort met his view, and by and by he reached the very end of the chimney, which was in the cellar. 'This is odd!' he reflected, much puzzled by this experience.  'If there is no fireplace, what on earth is the chimney good for?' Then he began to climb out again, and found it hard work, the space being so small.  And on his way up he noticed a thin, round pipe sticking through the side of the chimney, but could not guess what it was for. Finally he reached the roof and said to the reindeer: 'There was no need of my going down that chimney, for I could find no fireplace through which to enter the house.  I fear the children who live there must go without playthings this Christmas.' Then he drove on, but soon came to another new house with a small chimney.  This caused Santa Claus to shake his head doubtfully, but he tried the chimney, nevertheless, and found it exactly like the other. Moreover, he nearly stuck fast in the narrow flue and tore his jacket trying to get out again; so, although he came to several such chimneys that night, he did not venture to descend any more of them. 'What in the world are people thinking of, to build such useless chimneys?' he exclaimed.  'In all the years I have traveled with my reindeer I have never seen the like before.' True enough; but Santa Claus had not then discovered that stoves had been invented and were fast coming into use.  When he did find it out he wondered how the builders of those houses could have so little consideration for him, when they knew very well it was his custom to climb down chimneys and enter houses by way of the fireplaces.  Perhaps the men who built those houses had outgrown their own love for toys, and were indifferent whether Santa Claus called on their children or not.  Whatever the explanation might be, the poor children were forced to bear the burden of grief and disappointment. The following year Santa Claus found more and more of the new-fashioned chimneys that had no fireplaces, and the next year still more.  The third year, so numerous had the narrow chimneys become, he even had a few toys left in his sledge that he was unable to give away, because he could not get to the children. The matter had now become so serious that it worried the good man greatly, and he decided to talk it over with Kilter and Peter and Nuter and Wisk. Kilter already knew something about it, for it had been his duty to run around to all the houses, just before Christmas, and gather up the notes and letters to Santa Claus that the children had written, telling what they wished put in their stockings or hung on their Christmas trees.  But Kilter was a silent fellow, and seldom spoke of what he saw in the cities and villages.  The others were very indignant. 'Those people act as if they do not wish their children to be made happy!' said sensible Peter, in a vexed tone.  'The idea of shutting out such a generous friend to their little ones!' 'But it is my intention to make children happy whether their parents wish it or not,' returned Santa Claus.  'Years ago, when I first began making toys, children were even more neglected by their parents than they are now; so I have learned to pay no attention to thoughtless or selfish parents, but to consider only the longings of childhood.' 'You are right, my master,' said Nuter, the Ryl; 'many children would lack a friend if you did not consider them, and try to make them happy.' 'Then,' declared the laughing Wisk, 'we must abandon any thought of using these new-fashioned chimneys, but become burglars, and break into the houses some other way.' 'What way?' asked Santa Claus. 'Why, walls of brick and wood and plaster are nothing to Fairies.  I can easily pass through them whenever I wish, and so can Peter and Nuter and Kilter.  Is it not so, comrades?' 'I often pass through the walls when I gather up the letters,' said Kilter, and that was a long speech for him, and so surprised Peter and Nuter that their big round eyes nearly popped out of their heads. 'Therefore,' continued the Fairy, 'you may as well take us with you on your next journey, and when we come to one of those houses with stoves instead of fireplaces we will distribute the toys to the children without the need of using a chimney.' 'That seems to me a good plan,' replied Santa Claus, well pleased at having solved the problem.  'We will try it next year.' That was how the Fairy, the Pixie, the Knook and the Ryl all rode in the sledge with their master the following Christmas Eve; and they had no trouble at all in entering the new-fashioned houses and leaving toys for the children that lived in them. And their deft services not only relieved Santa Claus of much labor, but enabled him to complete his own work more quickly than usual, so that the merry party found themselves at home with an empty sledge a full hour before daybreak. The only drawback to the journey was that the mischievous Wisk persisted in tickling the reindeer with a long feather, to see them jump; and Santa Claus found it necessary to watch him every minute and to tweak his long ears once or twice to make him behave himself. But, taken all together, the trip was a great success, and to this day the four little folk always accompany Santa Claus on his yearly ride and help him in the distribution of his gifts. But the indifference of parents, which had so annoyed the good Saint, did not continue very long, and Santa Claus soon found they were really anxious he should visit their homes on Christmas Eve and leave presents for their children. So, to lighten his task, which was fast becoming very difficult indeed, old Santa decided to ask the parents to assist him. 'Get your Christmas trees all ready for my coming,' he said to them; 'and then I shall be able to leave the presents without loss of time, and you can put them on the trees when I am gone.' And to others he said: 'See that the children's stockings are hung up in readiness for my coming, and then I can fill them as quick as a wink.' And often, when parents were kind and good-natured, Santa Claus would simply fling down his package of gifts and leave the fathers and mothers to fill the stockings after he had darted away in his sledge. 'I will make all loving parents my deputies!' cried the jolly old fellow, 'and they shall help me do my work.  For in this way I shall save many precious minutes and few children need be neglected for lack of time to visit them.' Besides carrying around the big packs in his swift-flying sledge old Santa began to send great heaps of toys to the toy-shops, so that if parents wanted larger supplies for their children they could easily get them; and if any children were, by chance, missed by Santa Claus on his yearly rounds, they could go to the toy-shops and get enough to make them happy and contented.  For the loving friend of the little ones decided that no child, if he could help it, should long for toys in vain.  And the toy-shops also proved convenient whenever a child fell ill, and needed a new toy to amuse it; and sometimes, on birthdays, the fathers and mothers go to the toy-shops and get pretty gifts for their children in honor of the happy event. Perhaps you will now understand how, in spite of the bigness of the world, Santa Claus is able to supply all the children with beautiful gifts.  To be sure, the old gentleman is rarely seen in these days; but it is not because he tries to keep out of sight, I assure you.  Santa Claus is the same loving friend of children that in the old days used to play and romp with them by the hour; and I know he would love to do the same now, if he had the time.  But, you see, he is so busy all the year making toys, and so hurried on that one night when he visits our homes with his packs, that he comes and goes among us like a flash; and it is almost impossible to catch a glimpse of him. And, although there are millions and millions more children in the world than there used to be, Santa Claus has never been known to complain of their increasing numbers. 'The more the merrier!' he cries, with his jolly laugh; and the only difference to him is the fact that his little workmen have to make their busy fingers fly faster every year to satisfy the demands of so many little ones. 'In all this world there is nothing so beautiful as a happy child,' says good old Santa Claus; and if he had his way the children would all be beautiful, for all would be happy. There were three of them Jerry, Jimmy, and Kathleen. Of course, Jerry's name was Gerald, and not Jeremiah, whatever you may think; and Jimmy's name was James; and Kathleen was never called by her name at all, but Cathy, or Catty, or Puss Cat, when her brothers were pleased with her, and Scratch Cat when they were not pleased. And they were at school in a little town in the West of England the boys at one school, of course, and the girl at another, because the sensible habit of having boys and girls at the same school is not yet as common as I hope it will be some day. They used to see each other on Saturdays and Sundays at the house of a kind maiden lady; but it was one of those houses where it is impossible to play. You know the kind of house, don't you? There is a sort of a something about that kind of house that makes you hardly able even to talk to each other when you are left alone, and playing seems unnatural and affected. So they looked forward to the holidays, when they should all go home and be together all day long, in a house where playing was natural and conversation possible, and where the Hampshire forests and fields were full of interesting things to do and see. Their Cousin Betty was to be there too, and there were plans. Betty's school broke up before theirs, and so she got to the Hampshire home first, and the moment she got there she began to have measles, so that my three couldn't go home at all. You may imagine their feelings. The thought of seven weeks at Miss Hervey's was not to be borne, and all three wrote home and said so. This astonished their parents very much, because they had always thought it was so nice for the children to have dear Miss Hervey's to go to. However, they were 'jolly decent about it , as Jerry said, and after a lot of letters and telegrams, it was arranged that the boys should go and stay at Kathleen's school, where there were now no girls left and no mistresses except the French one. 'It'll be better than being at Miss Hervey's,' said Kathleen, when the boys came round to ask Mademoiselle when it would be convenient for them to come; 'and, besides, our school's not half so ugly as yours. We do have tablecloths on the tables and curtains at the windows, and yours is all deal boards, and desks, and inkiness.' When they had gone to pack their boxes Kathleen made all the rooms as pretty as she could with flowers in jam jars marigolds chiefly, because there was nothing much else in the back garden. There were geraniums in the front garden, and calceolarias and lobelias; of course, the children were not allowed to pick these. 'We ought to have some sort of play to keep us going through the holidays,' said Kathleen, when tea was over, and she had unpacked and arranged the boys clothes in the painted chests of drawers, feeling very grown-up and careful as she neatly laid the different sorts of clothes in tidy little heaps in the drawers. 'Suppose we write a book.' 'You couldn't,' said Jimmy. 'I didn't mean me, of course,' said Kathleen, a little injured; 'I meant us.' 'Too much fag,' said Gerald briefly. 'If we wrote a book,' Kathleen persisted, 'about what the insides of schools really are like, people would read it and say how clever we were.' 'More likely expel us,' said Gerald. 'No; we'll have an out-of-doors game bandits, or something like that. It wouldn't be bad if we could get a cave and keep stores in it, and have our meals there.' 'There aren't any caves,' said Jimmy, who was fond of contradicting everyone. 'And, besides, your precious Mamselle won't let us go out alone, as likely as not.' 'Oh, we'll see about that,' said Gerald. 'I'll go and talk to her like a father.' 'Like that?' Kathleen pointed the thumb of scorn at him, and he looked in the glass. 'To brush his hair and his clothes and to wash his face and hands was to our hero but the work of a moment,' said Gerald, and went to suit the action to the word. It was a very sleek boy, brown and thin and interesting-looking, that knocked at the door of the parlour where Mademoiselle sat reading a yellow-covered book and wishing vain wishes. Gerald could always make himself look interesting at a moment's notice, a very useful accomplishment in dealing with strange grown-ups. It was done by opening his grey eyes rather wide, allowing the corners of his mouth to droop, and assuming a gentle, pleading expression, resembling that of the late little Lord Fauntleroy who must, by the way, be quite old now, and an awful prig. 'Entrez!' said Mademoiselle, in shrill French accents. So he entered. 'Eh bien?' she said rather impatiently. 'I hope I am not disturbing you,' said Gerald, in whose mouth, it seemed, butter would not have melted. 'But no,' she said, somewhat softened. 'What is it that you desire?' 'I thought I ought to come and say how do you do,' said Gerald, 'because of you being the lady of the house.' He held out the newly-washed hand, still damp and red. She took it. 'You are a very polite little boy,' she said. 'Not at all,' said Gerald, more polite than ever. 'I am so sorry for you. It must be dreadful to have us to look after in the holidays.' 'But not at all,' said Mademoiselle in her turn. 'I am sure you will be very good childrens.' Gerald's look assured her that he and the others would be as near angels as children could be without ceasing to be human.'We'll try,' he said earnestly. 'Can one do anything for you?' asked the French governess kindly. 'Oh, no, thank you,' said Gerald. 'We don't want to give you any trouble at all. And I was thinking it would be less trouble for you if we were to go out into the woods all day tomorrow and take our dinner with us something cold, you know so as not to be a trouble to the cook.' 'You are very considerate,' said Mademoiselle coldly. Then Gerald's eyes smiled; they had a trick of doing this when his lips were quite serious. Mademoiselle caught the twinkle, and she laughed and Gerald laughed too. 'Little deceiver!' she said. 'Why not say at once you want to be free of surveillance, how you say overwatching without pretending it is me you wish to please?' 'You have to be careful with grown-ups, ' said Gerald, 'but it isn't all pretence either. We don't want to trouble you and we don't want you to ' 'To trouble you. Eh bien! Your parents, they permit these days at woods?' 'Oh, yes,' said Gerald truthfully. 'Then I will not be more a dragon than the parents. I will forewarn the cook. Are you content?' 'Rather!' said Gerald. 'Mademoiselle, you are a dear.' 'A deer?' she repeated 'a stag?' 'No, a a cherie,' said Gerald 'a regular A1 cherie. And you sha'n't repent it. Is there anything we can do for you wind your wool, or find your spectacles, or ?' 'He thinks me a grandmother!' said Mademoiselle, laughing more than ever. 'Go then, and be not more naughty than you must.' 'Well, what luck?' the others asked. 'It's all right,' said Gerald indifferently. 'I told you it would be. The ingenuous youth won the regard of the foreign governess, who in her youth had been the beauty of her humble village.' 'I don't believe she ever was. She's too stern,' said Kathleen. 'Ah!' said Gerald, 'that's only because you don't know how to manage her. She wasn't stern with me.' 'I say,' what a humbug you are though, aren't you?' said Jimmy. 'No, I'm a dip what's-its-name? Something like an ambassador. Dipsoplomatist that's what I am. Anyhow, we've got our day, and if we don't find a cave in it my name's not Jack Robinson.' Mademoiselle, less stern than Kathleen had ever seen her, presided at supper, which was bread and treacle spread several hours before, and now harder and drier than any other food you can think of. Gerald was very polite in handing her butter and cheese, and pressing her to taste the bread and treacle. 'Bah! it is like sand in the mouth of a dryness! Is it possible this pleases you?' 'No,' said Gerald, 'it is not possible, but it is not polite for boys to make remarks about their food!' She laughed, but there was no more dried bread and treacle for supper after that. 'How do you do it?' Kathleen whispered admiringly as they said good night. 'Oh, it's quite easy when you've once got a grownup to see what you're after. You'll see, I shall drive her with a rein of darning cotton after this.' Next morning Gerald got up early and gathered a little bunch of pink carnations from a plant which he found hidden among the marigolds. He tied it up with black cotton and laid it on Mademoiselle's plate. She smiled and looked quite handsome as she stuck the flowers in her belt. 'Do you think it's quite decent,' Jimmy asked later 'sort of bribing people to let you do as you like with flowers and things and passing them the salt?' 'It's not that,' said Kathleen suddenly. 'I know what Gerald means, only I never think of the things in time myself. You see, if you want grown-ups to be nice to you the least you can do is to be nice to them and think of little things to please them. I never think of any myself. Jerry does; that's why all the old ladies like him. It's not bribery. It's a sort of honesty like paying for things.' 'Well, anyway,' said Jimmy, putting away the moral question, 'we've got a ripping day for the woods.' They had. The wide High Street, even at the busy morning hour almost as quiet as a dream-street, lay bathed in sunshine; the leaves shone fresh from last night's rain, but the road was dry, and in the sunshine the very dust of it sparkled like diamonds. The beautiful old houses, standing stout and strong, looked as though they were basking in the sunshine and enjoying it. 'But are there any woods?' asked Kathleen as they passed the market-place. 'It doesn't much matter about woods,' said Gerald dreamily, 'we're sure to find something. One of the chaps told me his father said when he was a boy there used to be a little cave under the bank in a lane near the Salisbury Road; but he said there was an enchanted castle there too, so perhaps the cave isn't true either.' 'If we were to get horns,' said Kathleen, 'and to blow them very hard all the way, we might find a magic castle.' 'If you've got the money to throw away on horns...' said Jimmy contemptuously. 'Well, I have, as it happens, so there!' said Kathleen. And the horns were bought in a tiny shop with a bulging window full of a tangle of toys and sweets and cucumbers and sour apples. And the quiet square at the end of the town where the church is, and the houses of the most respectable people, echoed to the sound of horns blown long and loud. But none of the houses turned into enchanted castles. Away they went along the Salisbury Road, which was very hot and dusty, so they agreed to drink one of the bottles of ginger-beer. 'We might as well carry the ginger-beer inside us as inside the bottle,' said Jimmy, 'and we can hide the bottle and call for it as we come back. Presently they came to a place where the road, as Gerald said, went two ways at once. 'That looks like adventures,' said Kathleen; and they took the right-hand road, and the next time they took a turning it was a left-hand one, 'so as to be quite fair,' Jimmy said, and then a right-hand one and then a left, and so on, till they were completely lost. 'Completely,' said Kathleen; 'how jolly!' And now trees arched overhead, and the banks of the road were high and bushy. The adventurers had long since ceased to blow their horns. It was too tiring to go on doing that, when there was no one to be annoyed by it. 'Oh, kriky!' observed Jimmy suddenly, 'let's sit down a bit and have some of our dinner. We might call it lunch, you know,' he added persuasively. So they sat down in the hedge and ate the ripe red gooseberries that were to have been their dessert. And as they sat and rested and wished that their boots did not feel so full of feet, Gerald leaned back against the bushes, and the bushes gave way so that he almost fell over backward. Something had yielded to the pressure of his back, and there was the sound of something heavy that fell. 'Oh, Jimminy!' he remarked, recovering himself suddenly; 'there's something hollow in there the stone I was leaning against simply went!' 'I wish it was a cave,' said Jimmy; 'but of course it isn't.' 'If we blow the horns perhaps it will be,' said Kathleen, and hastily blew her own. Gerald reached his hand through the bushes. 'I can't feel anything but air,' he said; 'it's just a hole full of emptiness. The other two pulled back the bushes. There certainly was a hole in the bank. 'I'm going to go in,' observed Gerald. 'Oh, don't!' said his sister. 'I wish you wouldn't. Suppose there were snakes!' 'Not likely,' said Gerald, but he leaned forward and struck a match. 'It is a cave!' he cried, and put his knee on the mossy stone he had been sitting on, scrambled over it, and disappeared. A breathless pause followed. 'You all right?' asked Jimmy. 'Yes; come on. You'd better come feet first there's a bit of a drop.' 'I'll go next,' said Kathleen, and went feet first, as advised. The feet waved wildly in the air. 'Look out!' said Gerald in the dark; 'you'll have my eye out. Put your feet down, girl, not up. It's no use trying to fly here there's no room.' He helped her by pulling her feet forcibly down and then lifting her under the arms. She felt rustling dry leaves under her boots, and stood ready to receive Jimmy, who came in head first, like one diving into an unknown sea. 'It is a cave,' said Kathleen. 'The young explorers,' explained Gerald, blocking up the hole of entrance with his shoulders, 'dazzled at first by the darkness of the cave, could see nothing.' 'Darkness doesn't dazzle,' said Jimmy. 'I wish we'd got a candle,' said Kathleen. 'Yes, it does,' Gerald contradicted 'could see nothing. But their dauntless leader, whose eyes had grown used to the dark while the clumsy forms of the others were bunging up the entrance, had made a discovery. 'Oh, what!' Both the others were used to Gerald's way of telling a story while he acted it, but they did sometimes wish that he didn't talk quite so long and so like a book in moments of excitement. 'He did not reveal the dread secret to his faithful followers till one and all had given him their word of honour to be calm.' 'We'll be calm all right,' said Jimmy impatiently.'Well, then,' said Gerald, ceasing suddenly to be a book and becoming a boy, 'there's a light over there look behind you!' They looked. And there was. A faint greyness on the brown walls of the cave, and a brighter greyness cut off sharply by a dark line, showed that round a turning or angle of the cave there was daylight. 'Attention!' said Gerald; at least, that was what he meant, though what he said was 'Shun!' as becomes the son of a soldier. The others mechanically obeyed. 'You will remain at attention till I give the word 'Slow march!' on which you will advance cautiously in open order, following your hero leader, taking care not to tread on the dead and wounded.' 'I wish you wouldn't!' said Kathleen. 'There aren't any,' said Jimmy, feeling for her hand in the dark; 'he only means, take care not to tumble over stones and things' Here he found her hand, and she screamed. 'It's only me,' said Jimmy. 'I thought you'd like me to hold it. But you're just like a girl.' Their eyes had now begun to get accustomed to the darkness, and all could see that they were in a rough stone cave, that went straight on for about three or four yards and then turned sharply to the right. 'Death or victory!' remarked Gerald. 'Now, then Slow march!' He advanced carefully, picking his way among the loose earth and stones that were the floor of the cave. 'A sail, a sail!' he cried, as he turned the corner. 'How splendid!' Kathleen drew a long breath as she came out into the sunshine. 'I don't see any sail,' said Jimmy, following. The narrow passage ended in a round arch all fringed with ferns and creepers. They passed through the arch into a deep, narrow gully whose banks were of stones, moss-covered; and in the crannies grew more ferns and long grasses. Trees growing on the top of the bank arched across, and the sunlight came through in changing patches of brightness, turning the gully to a roofed corridor of goldy-green. The path, which was of greeny-grey flagstones where heaps of leaves had drifted, sloped steeply down, and at the end of it was another round arch, quite dark inside, above which rose rocks and grass and bushes. 'It's like the outside of a railway tunnel,' said James. 'It's the entrance to the enchanted castle,' said Kathleen. 'Let's blow the horns.' 'Dry up!' said Gerald. 'The bold Captain, reproving the silly chatter of his subordinates ,' 'I like that!' said Jimmy, indignant. 'I thought you would,' resumed Gerald 'of his subordinates, bade them advance with caution and in silence, because after all there might be somebody about, and the other arch might be an ice-house or something dangerous. 'What?' asked Kathleen anxiously. 'Bears, perhaps,' said Gerald briefly. 'There aren't any bears without bars in England, anyway,' said Jimmy. 'They call bears bars in America,' he added absently. 'Quick march!' was Gerald's only reply. And they marched. Under the drifted damp leaves the path was firm and stony to their shuffling feet. At the dark arch they stopped. 'There are steps down,' said Jimmy. 'It is an ice-house,' said Gerald. 'Don't let's,' said Kathleen. 'Our hero,' said Gerald, 'who nothing could dismay, raised the faltering hopes of his abject minions by saying that he was jolly well going on, and they could do as they liked about it.' 'If you call names,' said Jimmy, 'you can go on by yourself. He added, 'So there!' 'It's part of the game, silly,' explained Gerald kindly. 'You can be Captain tomorrow, so you'd better hold your jaw now, and begin to think about what names you'll call us when it's your turn.' Very slowly and carefully they went down the steps. A vaulted stone arched over their heads. Gerald struck a match when the last step was found to have no edge, and to be, in fact, the beginning of a passage, turning to the left. 'This,' said Jimmy, 'will take us back into the road.' 'Or under it,' said Gerald. 'We've come down eleven steps.' They went on, following their leader, who went very slowly for fear, as he explained, of steps. The passage was very dark. 'I don't half like it!' whispered Jimmy. Then came a glimmer of daylight that grew and grew, and presently ended in another arch that looked out over a scene so like a picture out of a book about Italy that everyone's breath was taken away, and they simply walked forward silent and staring. A short avenue of cypresses led, widening as it went, to a marble terrace that lay broad and white in the sunlight. The children, blinking, leaned their arms on the broad, flat balustrade and gazed. Immediately below them was a lake just like a lake in 'The Beauties of Italy' a lake with swans and an island and weeping willows; beyond it were green slopes dotted with groves of trees, and amid the trees gleamed the white limbs of statues. Against a little hill to the left was a round white building with pillars, and to the right a waterfall came tumbling down among mossy stones to splash into the lake. Steps fed from the terrace to the water, and other steps to the green lawns beside it. Away across the grassy slopes deer were feeding, and in the distance where the groves of trees thickened into what looked almost a forest were enormous shapes of grey stone, like nothing that the children had ever seen before. 'That chap at school ,' said Gerald. 'It is an enchanted castle,' said Kathleen. 'I don't see any castle,' said Jimmy. 'What do you call that, then?' Gerald pointed to where, beyond a belt of lime-trees, white towers and turrets broke the blue of the sky. 'There doesn't seem to be anyone about,' said Kathleen, 'and yet it's all so tidy. I believe it is magic' 'Magic mowing machines,' Jimmy suggested. 'If we were in a book it would be an enchanted castle certain to be,' said Kathleen. 'It is an enchanted castle,' said Gerald in hollow tones. 'But there aren't any' Jimmy was quite positive. 'How do you know? Do you think there's nothing in the world but what you've seen?' His scorn was crushing. 'I think magic went out when people began to have steam-engines,' Jimmy insisted, 'and newspapers, and telephones and wireless telegraphing.' 'Wireless is rather like magic when you come to think of it,' said Gerald. 'Oh, that sort!' Jimmy's contempt was deep. 'Perhaps there's given up being magic because people didn't believe in it any more,' said Kathleen. 'Well, don't let's spoil the show with any silly old not believing,' said Gerald with decision. 'I'm going to believe in magic as hard as I can. This is an enchanted garden, and that's an enchanted castle, and I'm jolly well going to explore.' The dauntless knight then led the way, leaving his ignorant squires to follow or not, just as they jolly well chose. He rolled off the balustrade and strode firmly down towards the lawn, his boots making, as they went, a clatter full of determination. The others followed. There never was such a garden out of a picture or a fairy-tale. They passed quite close by the deer, who only raised their pretty heads to look, and did not seem startled at all. And after a long stretch of turf they passed under the heaped-up heavy masses of lime-trees and came into a rose-garden, bordered with thick, close-cut yew hedges, and lying red and pink and green and white in the sun, like a giant's many-coloured, highly-scented pocket-handkerchief. 'I know we shall meet a gardener in a minute, and he'll ask what we re doing here. And then what will you say?' Kathleen asked with her nose in a rose. 'I shall say we have lost our way, and it will be quite true,' said Gerald. But they did not meet a gardener or anybody else, and the feeling of magic got thicker and thicker, till they were almost afraid of the sound of their feet in the great silent place. Beyond the rose garden was a yew hedge with an arch cut in it, and it was the beginning of a maze like the one in Hampton Court. 'Now,' said Gerald, 'you mark my words. In the middle of this maze we shall find the secret enchantment. Draw your swords, my merry men all, and hark forward tallyho in the utmost silence. Which they did. It was very hot in the maze, between the close yew hedges, and the way to the maze's heart was hidden well. Again and again they found themselves at the black yew arch that opened on the rose garden, and they were all glad that they had brought large, clean pocket-handkerchiefs with them. It was when they found themselves there for the fourth time that Jimmy suddenly cried, 'Oh, I wish ' and then stopped short very suddenly. 'Oh!' he added in quite a different voice, 'where's the dinner?' And then in a stricken silence they all remembered that the basket with the dinner had been left at the entrance of the cave. Their thoughts dwelt fondly on the slices of cold mutton, the six tomatoes, the bread and butter, the screwed-up paper of salt, the apple turnovers, and the little thick glass that one drank the ginger-beer out of. 'Let's go back,' said Jimmy, 'now this minute, and get our things and have our dinner.' 'Let's have one more try at the maze. I hate giving things up,' said Gerald. 'I am so hungry!' said Jimmy. 'Why didn't you say so before?' asked Gerald bitterly. 'I wasn't before.' 'Then you can't be now. You don't get hungry all in a minute. What's that?' That was a gleam of red that lay at the foot of the yew-hedge a thin little line, that you would hardly have noticed unless you had been staring in a fixed and angry way at the roots of the hedge. It was a thread of cotton. Gerald picked it up. One end of it was tied to a thimble with holes in it, and the other,  'There is no other end,' said Gerald, with firm triumph. 'It's a clew that's what it is. What price cold mutton now? I've always felt something magic would happen some day, and now it has.' 'I expect the gardener put it there,' said Jimmy. 'With a Princess's silver thimble on it? Look! there's a crown on the thimble.' There was. 'Come,' said Gerald in low, urgent tones, 'if you are adventurers be adventurers; and anyhow, I expect someone has gone along the road and bagged the mutton hours ago.' He walked forward, winding the red thread round his fingers as he went. And it was a clew, and it led them right into the middle of the maze. And in the very middle of the maze they came upon the wonder. The red clew led them up two stone steps to a round grass plot. There was a sun-dial in the middle, and all round against the yew hedge a low, wide marble seat. The red clew ran straight across the grass and by the sun-dial, and ended in a small brown hand with jewelled rings on every finger. The hand was, naturally, attached to an arm, and that had many bracelets on it, sparkling with red and blue and green stones. The arm wore a sleeve of pink and gold brocaded silk, faded a little here and there but still extremely imposing, and the sleeve was part of a dress, which was worn by a lady who lay on the stone seat asleep in the sun. The rosy gold dress fell open over an embroidered petticoat of a soft green colour. There was old yellow lace the colour of scalded cream, and a thin white veil spangled with silver stars covered the face. 'It's the enchanted Princess,' said Gerald, now really impressed. 'I told you so.' 'It's the Sleeping Beauty,' said Kathleen. 'It is look how old-fashioned her clothes are, like the pictures of Marie Antoinette's ladies in the history book. She has slept for a hundred years. Oh, Gerald, you're the eldest; you must be the Prince, and we never knew it.' 'She isn't really a Princess,' said Jimmy. But the others laughed at him, partly because his saying things like that was enough to spoil any game, and partly because they really were not at all sure that it was not a Princess who lay there as still as the sunshine. Every stage of the adventure the cave, the wonderful gardens, the maze, the clew, had deepened the feeling of magic, till now Kathleen and Gerald were almost completely bewitched. 'Lift the veil up,' Jerry, said Kathleen in a whisper, 'if she isn't beautiful we shall know she can't be the Princess. 'Lift it yourself,' said Gerald. 'I expect you're forbidden to touch the figures,' said Jimmy. 'It's not wax, silly,' said his brother. 'No,' said his sister, 'wax wouldn't be much good in this sun. And, besides, you can see her breathing. It's the Princess right enough.' She very gently lifted the edge of the veil and turned it back. The Princess's face was small and white between long plaits of black hair. Her nose was straight and her brows finely traced. There were a few freckles on cheekbones and nose. 'No wonder,' whispered Kathleen, 'sleeping all these years in all this sun! Her mouth was not a rosebud. But all the same 'Isn't she lovely!' Kathleen murmured. 'Not so dusty,' Gerald was understood to reply. 'Now, Jerry,' said Kathleen firmly, 'you're the eldest.' 'Of course I am,' said Gerald uneasily. 'Well, you've got to wake the Princess.' 'She's not a Princess,' said Jimmy, with his hands in the pockets of his knickerbockers; 'she's only a little girl dressed up.' 'But she's in long dresses,' urged Kathleen. 'Yes, but look what a little way down her frock her feet come. She wouldn't be any taller than Jerry if she was to stand up.' 'Now then,' urged Kathleen. 'Jerry, don't be silly. You've got to do it.' 'Do what?' asked Gerald, kicking his left boot with his right. 'Why, kiss her awake, of course.' 'Not me!' was Gerald's unhesitating rejoinder. 'Well, someone's got to.' 'She'd go for me as likely as not the minute she woke up,' said Gerald anxiously. 'I'd do it like a shot,' said Kathleen, 'but I don't suppose it ud make any difference me kissing her.' She did it; and it didn't. The Princess still lay in deep slumber. 'Then you must, Jimmy. I dare say you'll do. Jump back quickly before she can hit you.' 'She won't hit him, he's such a little chap,' said Gerald. 'Little yourself!' said Jimmy. 'I don't mind kissing her. I'm not a coward, like Some People. Only if I do, I'm going to be the dauntless leader for the rest of the day.' 'No, look here hold on!' cried Gerald, 'perhaps I'd better ' But, in the meantime, Jimmy had planted a loud, cheerful-sounding kiss on the Princess's pale cheek, and now the three stood breathless, awaiting the result. And the result was that the Princess opened large, dark eyes, stretched out her arms, yawned a little, covering her mouth with a small brown hand, and said, quite plainly and distinctly, and without any room at all for mistake: 'Then the hundred years are over? How the yew hedges have grown! Which of you is my Prince that aroused me from my deep sleep of so many long years?' 'I did,' said Jimmy fearlessly, for she did not look as though she were going to slap anyone. 'My noble preserver!' said the Princess, and held out her hand. Jimmy shook it vigorously. 'But I say,' said he, 'you aren't really a Princess, are you?' 'Of course I am,' she answered; 'who else could I be? Look at my crown!' She pulled aside the spangled veil, and showed beneath it a coronet of what even Jimmy could not help seeing to be diamonds. 'But ' said Jimmy. 'Why,' she said, opening her eyes very wide, 'you must have known about my being here, or you'd never have come. How did you get past the dragons?' Gerald ignored the question. 'I say,' he said, 'do you really believe in magic, and all that?' 'I ought to,' she said, 'if anybody does. Look, here's the place where I pricked my finger with the spindle.' She showed a little scar on her wrist. 'Then this really is an enchanted castle?' 'Of course it is,' said the Princess. 'How stupid you are!' She stood up, and her pink brocaded dress lay in bright waves about her feet. 'I said her dress would be too long,' said Jimmy. 'It was the right length when I went to sleep,' said the Princess; 'it must have grown in the hundred years.' 'I don't believe you're a Princess at all,' said Jimmy; 'at least ' 'Don't bother about believing it, if you don't like,' said the Princess. 'It doesn't so much matter what you believe as what I am. She turned to the others. 'Let's go back to the castle,' she said, 'and I'll show you all my lovely jewels and things. Wouldn't you like that?' 'Yes, said Gerald with very plain hesitation. 'But ' 'But what?' The Princess's tone was impatient. 'But we're most awfully hungry.' 'Oh, so am I!' cried the Princess. 'We've had nothing to eat since breakfast.' 'And it's three now,' said the Princess, looking at the sun-dial. 'Why, you've had nothing to eat for hours and hours and hours. But think of me! I haven't had anything to eat for a hundred years.' Come along to the castle. 'The mice will have eaten everything,' said Jimmy sadly. He saw now that she really was a Princess. 'Not they,' cried the Princess joyously. 'You forget everything's enchanted here. Time simply stood still for a hundred years. Come along, and one of you must carry my train, or I shan't be able to move now it's grown such a frightful length.' When you are young so many things are difficult to believe, and yet the dullest people will tell you that they are true such things, for instance, as that the earth goes round the sun, and that it is not flat but round. But the things that seem really likely, like fairy-tales and magic, are, so say the grown-ups, not true at all. Yet they are so easy to believe, especially when you see them happening. And, as I am always telling you, the most wonderful things happen to all sorts of people, only you never hear about them because the people think that no one will believe their stories, and so they don't tell them to any one except me. And they tell me, because they know that I can believe anything. When Jimmy had awakened the Sleeping Princess, and she had invited the three children to go with her to her palace and get something to eat, they all knew quite surely that they had come into a place of magic happenings. And they walked in a slow procession along the grass towards the castle. The Princess went first, and Kathleen carried her shining train; then came Jimmy, and Gerald came last. They were all quite sure that they had walked right into the middle of a fairy-tale, and they were the more ready to believe it because they were so tired and hungry. They were, in fact, so hungry and tired that they hardly noticed where they were going, or observed the beauties of the formal gardens through which the pink-silk Princess was leading them. They were in a sort of dream, from which they only partially awakened to find themselves in a big hail, with suits of armour and old flags round the walls, the skins of beasts on the floor, and heavy oak tables and benches ranged along it. The Princess entered, slow and stately, but once inside she twitched her sheeny train out of Jimmy's hand and turned to the three. 'You just wait here a minute,' she said, 'and mind you don't talk while I'm away. This castle is crammed with magic, and I don't know what will happen if you talk.' And with that, picking up the thick goldy-pink folds under her arms, she ran out, as Jimmy said afterwards, 'most unprincesslike,' showing as she ran black stockings and black strap shoes. Jimmy wanted very much to say that he didn't believe anything would happen, only he was afraid something would happen if he did, so he merely made a face and put out his tongue. The others pretended not to see this, which was much more crushing than anything they could have said. So they sat in silence, and Gerald ground the heel of his boot upon the marble floor. Then the Princess came back, very slowly and kicking her long skirts in front of her at every step. She could not hold them up now because of the tray she carried. It was not a silver tray, as you might have expected, but an oblong tin one. She set it down noisily on the end of the long table and breathed a sigh of relief.. 'Oh! it was heavy,' she said. I don't know what fairy feast the children's fancy had been busy with. Anyhow, this was nothing like it. The heavy tray held a loaf of bread, a lump of cheese, and a brown jug of water. The rest of its heaviness was just plates and mugs and knives. 'Come along,' said the Princess hospitably. 'I couldn't find anything but bread and cheese but it doesn't matter, because everything's magic here, and unless you have some dreadful secret fault the bread and cheese will turn into anything you like. What would you like?' she asked Kathleen. 'Roast chicken,' said Kathleen, without hesitation. The pinky Princess cut a slice of bread and laid it on a dish. 'There you are,' she said, 'roast chicken. Shall I carve it, or will you?' 'You, please,' said Kathleen, and received a piece of dry bread on a plate. 'Green peas?' asked the Princess, cut a piece of cheese and laid it beside the bread. Kathleen began to eat the bread, cutting it up with knife and fork as you would eat chicken. It was no use owning that she didn't see any chicken and peas, or anything but cheese and dry bread, because that would be owning that she had some dreadful secret fault. 'If I have, it is a secret, even from me,' she told herself. The others asked for roast beef and cabbage and got it, she supposed, though to her it only looked like dry bread and Dutch cheese. 'I do wonder what my dreadful secret fault is,' she thought, as the Princess remarked that, as for her, she could fancy a slice of roast peacock. 'This one, she added, lifting a second mouthful of dry bread on her fork, 'is quite delicious.' 'It's a game, isn't it?' asked Jimmy suddenly. 'What's a game?' asked the Princess, frowning. 'Pretending it's beef the bread and cheese, I mean.' 'A game? But it is beef. Look at it,' said the Princess, opening her eyes very wide. 'Yes, of course,' said Jimmy feebly. 'I was only joking.' Bread and cheese is not perhaps so good as roast beef or chicken or peacock (I'm not sure about the peacock. I never tasted peacock, did you?); but bread and cheese is, at any rate, very much better than nothing when you have gone on having nothing since breakfast (gooseberries and ginger-beer hardly count) and it is long past your proper dinner-time. Everyone ate and drank and felt much better. 'Now,' said the Princess, brushing the bread crumbs off her green silk lap, 'if you're sure you won't have any more meat you can come and see my treasures. Sure you won't take the least bit more chicken? No? Then follow me.' She got up and they followed her down the long hall to the end where the great stone stairs ran up at each side and joined in a broad flight leading to the gallery above. Under the stairs was a hanging of tapestry. 'Beneath this arras,' said the Princess, 'is the door leading to my private apartments.' She held the tapestry up with both hands, for it was heavy, and showed a little door that had been hidden by it. 'The key,' she said, 'hangs above.' And so it did, on a large rusty nail. 'Put it in,' said the Princess, 'and turn it.' Gerald did so, and the great key creaked and grated in the lock. 'Now push,' she said; 'push hard, all of you. They pushed hard, all of them. The door gave way, and they fell over each other into the dark space beyond. The Princess dropped the curtain and came after them, closing the door behind her. 'Look out!' she said; 'look out!' there are two steps down. 'Thank you,' said Gerald, rubbing his knee at the bottom of the steps. 'We found that out for ourselves.' 'I'm sorry,' said the Princess, 'but you can't have hurt yourselves much. Go straight on. There aren't any more steps.' They went straight on in the dark. 'When you come to the door just turn the handle and go in. Then stand still till I find the matches. I know where they are.' 'Did they have matches a hundred years ago?' asked Jimmy. 'I meant the tinder-box,' said the Princess quickly. 'We always called it the matches. Don't you? Here, let me go first.' She did, and when they had reached the door she was waiting for them with a candle in her hand. She thrust it on Gerald. 'Hold it steady,' she said, and undid the shutters of a long window, so that first a yellow streak and then a blazing great oblong of light flashed at them and the room was full of sunshine. 'It makes the candle look quite silly,' said Jimmy. 'So it does, said the Princess, and blew out the candle. Then she took the key from the outside of the door, put it in the inside keyhole, and turned it. The room they were in was small and high. Its domed ceiling was of deep blue with gold stars painted on it. The walls were of wood, panelled and carved, and there was no furniture in it whatever. 'This,' said the Princess, 'is my treasure chamber.' 'But where, asked Kathleen politely, 'are the treasures?' 'Don't you see them?' asked the Princess. 'No, we don't,' said Jimmy bluntly. 'You don't come that bread-and-cheese game with me not twice over, you don't!' 'If you really don't see them,' said the Princess, 'I suppose I shall have to say the charm. Shut your eyes, please. And give me your word of honour you won't look till I tell you, and that you'll never tell anyone what you've seen.' Their words of honour were something that the children would rather not have given just then, but they gave them all the same, and shut their eyes tight. 'Wiggadil yougadoo begadee leegadeeve nowgadow?' said the Princess rapidly; and they heard the swish of her silk train moving across the room. Then there was a creaking, rustling noise. 'She's locking us in!' cried Jimmy. 'Your word of honour,' gasped Gerald. 'Oh, do be quick!' moaned Kathleen. 'You may look,' said the voice of the Princess. And they looked. The room was not the same room, yet yes, the starry-vaulted blue ceiling was there, and below it half a dozen feet of the dark panelling, but below that the walls of the room blazed and sparkled with white and blue and red and green and gold and silver. Shelves ran round the room, and on them were gold cups and silver dishes, and platters and goblets set with gems, ornaments of gold and silver, tiaras of diamonds, necklaces of rubies, strings of emeralds and pearls, all set out in unimaginable splendour against a background of faded blue velvet. It was like the Crown jewels that you see when your kind uncle takes you to the Tower, only there seemed to be far more jewels than you or anyone else has ever seen together at the Tower or anywhere else. The three children remained breathless, open-mouthed, staring at the sparkling splendours all about them, while the Princess stood, her arm stretched out in a gesture of command, and a proud smile on her lips. 'My word!' said Gerald, in a low whisper. But no one spoke out loud. They waited as if spellbound for the Princess to speak. She spoke. 'What price bread-and-cheese games now?' she asked triumphantly. 'Can I do magic, or can't I?' 'You can; oh, you can!' said Kathleen. 'May we may we touch?' asked Gerald. 'All that's mine is yours,' said the Princess, with a generous wave of her brown hand, and added quickly, 'Only, of course, you mustn't take anything away with you.' 'We're not thieves!' said Jimmy. The others were already turning over the wonderful things on the blue velvet shelves. 'Perhaps not,' said the Princess, 'but you're a very unbelieving little boy. You think I can't see inside you, but I can. I know what you've been thinking.' 'What?' asked Jimmy. 'Oh, you know well enough,' said the Princess. 'You're thinking about the bread and cheese that I changed into beef, and about your secret fault. I say, let's all dress up and you be princes and princesses too.' 'To crown our hero,' said Gerald, lifting a gold crown with a cross on the top, 'was the work of a moment.' He put the crown on his head, and added a collar of SS and a zone of sparkling emeralds, which would not quite meet round his middle. He turned from fixing it by an ingenious adaptation of his belt to find the others already decked with diadems, necklaces, and rings. 'How splendid you look!' said the Princess, 'and how I wish your clothes were prettier. What ugly clothes people wear nowadays! A hundred years ago ' Kathleen stood quite still with a diamond bracelet raised in her hand. 'I say,' she said. 'The King and Queen?' 'What King and Queen?' asked the Princess. 'Your father and mother,' your sorrowing parents, said Kathleen. 'They'll have waked up by now. Won't they be wanting to see you, after a hundred years, you know?' 'Oh ah yes,' said the Princess slowly. 'I embraced my rejoicing parents when I got the bread and cheese. They re having their dinner. They won't expect me yet. Here,' she added, hastily putting a ruby bracelet on Kathleen's arm, 'see how splendid that is!' Kathleen would have been quite content to go on all day trying on different jewels and looking at herself in the little silver-framed mirror that the Princess took from one of the shelves, but the boys were soon weary of this amusement. 'Look here,' said Gerald, 'if you're sure your father and mother won't want you, let's go out and have a jolly good game of something. You could play besieged castles awfully well in that maze unless you can do any more magic tricks.' 'You forget,' said the Princess, 'I'm grown up. I don't play games. And I don't like to do too much magic at a time, it's so tiring. Besides, it'll take us ever so long to put all these things back in their proper places.' It did. The children would have laid the jewels just anywhere; but the Princess showed them that every necklace, or ring, or bracelet had its own home on the velvet a slight hollowing in the shelf beneath, so that each stone fitted into its own little nest. As Kathleen was fitting the last shining ornament into its proper place, she saw that part of the shelf near it held, not bright jewels, but rings and brooches and chains, as well as queer things that she did not know the names of, and all were of dull metal and odd shapes. 'What's all this rubbish?' she asked. 'Rubbish, indeed!' said the Princess. 'Why those are all magic things! This bracelet anyone who wears it has got to speak the truth. This chain makes you as strong as ten men; if you wear this spur your horse will go a mile a minute; or if you're walking it's the same as seven-league boots.' 'What does this brooch do?' asked Kathleen, reaching out her hand. The princess caught her by the wrist. 'You mustn't touch,' she said; 'if anyone but me touches them all the magic goes out at once and never comes back. That brooch will give you any wish you like.' 'And this ring?' Jimmy pointed. 'Oh, that makes you invisible.' 'What's this?' asked Gerald, showing a curious buckle. 'Oh, that undoes the effect of all the other charms.' 'Do you mean really?' Jimmy asked. 'You're not just kidding?' 'Kidding indeed!' repeated the Princess scornfully. 'I should have thought I'd shown you enough magic to prevent you speaking to a Princess like that!' 'I say,' said Gerald, visibly excited. 'You might show us how some of the things act. Couldn't you give us each a wish?' The Princess did not at once answer. And the minds of the three played with granted wishes brilliant yet thoroughly reasonable  the kind of wish that never seems to occur to people in fairy-tales when they suddenly get a chance to have their three wishes granted. 'No,' said the Princess suddenly, 'no; I can't give wishes to you, it only gives me wishes. But I'll let you see the ring make me invisible. Only you must shut your eyes while I do it.' They shut them. 'Count fifty,' said the Princess, 'and then you may look. And then you must shut them again, and count fifty, and I'll reappear.' Gerald counted, aloud. Through the counting one could hear a creaking, rustling sound. 'Forty-seven, forty-eight, forty-nine, fifty!' said Gerald, and they opened their eyes. They were alone in the room. The jewels had vanished and so had the Princess. 'She's gone out by the door, of course,' said Jimmy, but the door was locked. 'That is magic,' said Kathleen breathlessly. 'Maskelyne and Devant can do that trick, said Jimmy. 'And I want my tea.' 'Your tea!' Gerald's tone was full of contempt. 'The lovely Princess, he went on, 'reappeared as soon as our hero had finished counting fifty. One, two, three, four ,' Gerald and Kathleen had both closed their eyes. But somehow Jimmy hadn't. He didn't mean to cheat, he just forgot. And as Gerald's count reached twenty he saw a panel under the window open slowly. 'Her,' he said to himself. 'I knew it was a trick!' and at once shut his eyes, like an honourable little boy. On the word 'fifty' six eyes opened. And the panel was closed and there was no Princess. 'She hasn't pulled it off this time,' said Gerald. 'Perhaps you'd better count again,' said Kathleen. 'I believe there's a cupboard under the window,' said Jimmy, 'and she's hidden in it. Secret panel, you know.' 'You looked! That's cheating,' said the voice of the Princess so close to his ear that he quite jumped. 'I didn't cheat.' 'Where on earth What ever ,' said all three together. For still there was no Princess to be seen. 'Come back visible, Princess dear,' said Kathleen. 'Shall we shut our eyes and count again?' 'Don't be silly!' said the voice of the Princess, and it sounded very cross. 'We're not silly,' said Jimmy, and his voice was cross too. 'Why can't you come back and have done with it? You know you're only hiding.' 'Don't!' said Kathleen gently. 'She is invisible, you know.' 'So should I be if I got into the cupboard,' said Jimmy. 'Oh yes,' said the sneering tone of the Princess, 'you think yourselves very clever, I dare say. But I don't mind. We'll play that you can't see me, if you like.' 'Well, but we can't,' said Gerald. 'It's no use getting in a wax. If you're hiding, as Jimmy says, you'd better come out. If you've really turned invisible, you'd better make yourself visible again.' 'Do you really mean,' asked a voice quite changed, but still the Princess's, 'that you can't see me?' 'Can't you see we can't?' asked Jimmy rather unreasonably. The sun was blazing in at the window; the eight-sided room was very hot, and everyone was getting cross. 'You can't see me?' There was the sound of a sob in the voice of the invisible Princess. 'No, I tell you,' said Jimmy, 'and I want my tea and ' What he was saying was broken off short, as one might break a stick of sealing wax. And then in the golden afternoon a really quite horrid thing happened: Jimmy suddenly leaned backwards, then forwards, his eyes opened wide and his mouth too. Backward and forward he went, very quickly and abruptly, then stood still. 'Oh, he's in a fit! Oh, Jimmy, dear Jimmy!' cried Kathleen, hurrying to him. 'What is it, dear, what is it?' 'It's not a fit,' gasped Jimmy angrily. 'She shook me.' 'Yes, said the voice of the Princess, 'and I'll shake him again if he keeps on saying he can't see me.' 'You'd better shake me,' said Gerald angrily. 'I'm nearer your own size.' And instantly she did. But not for long. The moment Gerald felt hands on his shoulders he put up his own and caught those other hands by the wrists. And there he was, holding wrists that he couldn't see. It was a dreadful sensation. An invisible kick made him wince, but he held tight to the wrists. 'Cathy,' he cried, 'come and hold her legs; she's kicking me.' 'Where?' cried Kathleen, anxious to help. 'I don't see any legs.' 'This is her hands I've got,' cried Gerald. 'She is invisible right enough. Get hold of this hand, and then you can feel your way down to her legs.' Kathleen did so. I wish I could make you understand how very, very uncomfortable and frightening it is to feel, in broad daylight, hands and arms that you can't see. 'I won't have you hold my legs,' said the invisible Princess, struggling violently. 'What are you so cross about?' Gerald was quite calm. 'You said you'd be invisible and you are.' 'I'm not.' 'You are really. Look in the glass.' 'I'm not; I can't be.' 'Look in the glass,' Gerald repeated, quite unmoved. 'Let go, then,' she said. Gerald did, and the moment he had done so he found it impossible to believe that he really had been holding invisible hands. 'You're just pretending not to see me,' said the Princess anxiously, 'aren't you? Do say you are. You've had your joke with me. Don't keep it up. I don't like it.' 'On our sacred word of honour,' said Gerald, 'you're still invisible. There was a silence. Then, 'Come,' said the Princess. 'I'll let you out, and you can go. I'm tired of playing with you.' They followed her voice to the door, and through it, and along the little passage into the hall. No one said anything. Everyone felt very uncomfortable. 'Let's get out of this,' whispered Jimmy as they got to the end of the hall. But the voice of the Princess said: 'Come out this way; it's quicker. I think you're perfectly hateful. I'm sorry I ever played with you. Mother always told me not to play with strange children.' A door abruptly opened, though no hand was seen to touch it. 'Come through, can't you!' said the voice of the Princess. It was a little ante-room, with long, narrow mirrors between its long, narrow windows. 'Good-bye, said Gerald. 'Thanks for giving us such a jolly time. Let's part friends, he added, holding out his hand. An unseen hand was slowly put in his, which closed on it, vice-like. 'Now,' he said, 'you've jolly well got to look in the glass and own that we're not liars.' He led the invisible Princess to. one of the mirrors, and held her in front of it by the shoulders. 'Now,' he said, 'you just look for yourself.' There was a silence, and then a cry of despair rang through the room. 'Oh oh oh! I am invisible. Whatever shall I do?' 'Take the ring off,' said Kathleen, suddenly practical. Another silence. 'I can't!' cried the Princess. 'It won't come off. But it can't be the ring; rings don't make you invisible.' 'You said this one did,' said Kathleen, 'and it has.' 'But it can't,' said the Princess. 'I was only playing at magic. I just hid in the secret cupboard it was only a game. Oh, whatever shall I do?' 'A game?' said Gerald slowly; 'but you can do magic  the invisible jewels, and you made them come visible.' 'Oh, it's only a secret spring and the panelling slides up. Oh, what am I to do?' Kathleen moved towards the voice and gropingly got her arms round a pink-silk waist that she couldn't see. Invisible arms clasped her, a hot invisible cheek was laid against hers, and warm invisible tears lay wet between the two faces. 'Don't cry, dear,' said Kathleen; 'let me go and tell the King and Queen.' 'The ?' 'Your royal father and mother.' 'Oh, don't mock me!' said the poor Princess. 'You know that was only a game, too, like ,' 'Like the bread and cheese,' said Jimmy triumphantly. 'I knew that was!' 'But your dress and being asleep in the maze, and ,' 'Oh, I dressed up for fun, because everyone's away at the fair, and I put the clew just to make it all more real. I was playing at Fair Rosamond first, and then I heard you talking in the maze, and I thought what fun; and now I'm invisible, and I shall never come right again, never I know I shan't! It serves me right for lying, but I didn't really think you'd believe it  not more than half, that is,' she added hastily, trying to be truthful. 'But if you're not the Princess, who are you?' asked Kathleen, still embracing the unseen. 'I'm my aunt lives here,' said the invisible Princess. 'She may be home any time. Oh, what shall I do?' 'Perhaps she knows some charm ' 'Oh, nonsense!' said the voice sharply; 'she doesn't believe in charms. She would be so vexed. Oh, I daren't let her see me like this!' she added wildly. 'And all of you here, too. She'd be so dreadfully cross.' The beautiful magic castle that the children had believed in now felt as though it were tumbling about their ears. All that was left was the invisibleness of the Princess. But that, you will own, was a good deal. 'I just said it, moaned the voice, 'and it came true. I wish I'd never played at magic I wish I'd never played at anything at all.' 'Oh, don't say that,' Gerald said kindly. 'Let's go out into the garden, near the lake, where it's cool, and we'll hold a solemn council. You'll like that, won't you?' 'Oh!' cried Kathleen suddenly, 'the buckle; that makes magic come undone!' 'It doesn't really,' murmured the voice that seemed to speak without lips. 'I only just said that.' 'You only 'just said' about the ring,' said Gerald. 'Anyhow, let's try.' 'Not you me,' said the voice. 'You go down to the Temple of Flora, by the lake. I'll go back to the jewel-room by myself. Aunt might see you.' 'She won't see you,' said Jimmy. 'Don't rub it in,' said Gerald. 'Where is the Temple of Flora?' 'That's the way,' the voice said; 'down those steps and along the winding path through the shrubbery. You can't miss it. It's white marble, with a statue goddess inside.' The three children went down to the white marble Temple of Flora that stood close against the side of the little hill, and sat down in its shadowy inside. It had arches all round except against the hill behind the statue, and it was cool and restful. They had not been there five minutes before the feet of a runner sounded loud on the gravel. A shadow, very black and distinct, fell on the white marble floor. 'Your shadow's not invisible, anyhow,' said Jimmy. 'Oh, bother my shadow!' the voice of the Princess replied. 'We left the key inside the door, and it's shut itself with the wind, and it's a spring lock!' There was a heartfelt pause. Then Gerald said, in his most business-like manner: 'Sit down, Princess, and we'll have a thorough good palaver about it.' 'I shouldn't wonder,' said Jimmy, 'if we was to wake up and find it was dreams.' 'No such luck,' said the voice. 'Well,' said Gerald, 'first of all, what's your name, and if you're not a Princess, who are you?' 'I'm I'm,' said a voice broken with sobs, 'I'm the  housekeeper's niece at the castle and my name's Mabel Prowse.' 'That's exactly what I thought,' said Jimmy, without a shadow of truth, because how could he? The others were silent. It was a moment full of agitation and confused ideas. 'Well, anyhow,' said Gerald, 'you belong here.' 'Yes,' said the voice, and it came from the floor, as though its owner had flung herself down in the madness of despair. 'Oh yes, I belong here right enough, but what's the use of belonging anywhere if you're invisible?' Those of my readers who have gone about much with an invisible companion will not need to be told how awkward the whole business is. For one thing, however much you may have been convinced that your companion is invisible, you will, I feel sure, have found yourself every now and then saying, 'This must be a dream!' or 'I know I shall wake up in half a sec!' And this was the case with Gerald, Kathleen, and Jimmy as they sat in the white marble Temple of Flora, looking out through its arches at the sunshiny park and listening to the voice of the enchanted Princess, who really was not a Princess at all, but just the housekeeper's niece, Mabel Prowse; though, as Jimmy said, 'she was enchanted, right enough.' 'It's no use talking,' she said again and again, and the voice came from an empty-looking space between two pillars; 'I never believed anything would happen, and now it has.' 'Well,' said Gerald kindly, 'can we do anything for you? Because, if not, I think we ought to be going.' 'Yes,' said Jimmy; 'I do want my tea!' 'Tea!' said the unseen Mabel scornfully. 'Do you mean to say you'd go off to your teas and leave me after getting me into this mess?' 'Well, of all the unfair Princesses I ever met!' Gerald began. But Kathleen interrupted 'Oh, don't rag her,' she said. 'Think how horrid it must be to be invisible!' 'I don't think,' said the hidden Mabel, 'that my aunt likes me very much as it is. She wouldn't let me go to the fair because I'd forgotten to put back some old trumpery shoe that Queen Elizabeth wore I got it out from the glass case to try it on.' 'Did it fit?' asked Kathleen, with interest 'Not it much too small,' said Mabel. 'I don't believe it ever fitted anyone.' 'I do want my tea!' said Jimmy 'I do really think perhaps we ought to go,' said Gerald. 'You see, it isn't as if we could do anything for you.' 'You'll have to tell your aunt,' said Kathleen kindly 'No, no, no!' moaned Mabel invisibly; 'take me with you. I'll leave her a note to say I've run away to sea.' 'Girls don't run away to sea.'' They might,' said the stone floor between the pillars, 'as stowaways, if nobody wanted a cabin boy cabin girl, I mean.' 'I'm sure you oughtn't,' said Kathleen firmly. 'Well, what am I to do?' 'Really,' said Gerald, 'I don't know what the girl can do. Let her come home with us and have ' 'Tea oh, yes,' said Jimmy, jumping up. 'And have a good council.' 'After tea,' said Jimmy 'But her aunt'lI find she's gone.' 'So she would if I stayed.' 'Oh, come on,' said Jimmy. 'But the aunt'll think something's happened to her.' 'So it has.' 'And she'll tell the police, and they'll look everywhere for me.' 'They'll never find you,' said Gerald. 'Talk of impenetrable disguises!' 'I'm sure,' said Mabel, 'aunt would much rather never see me again than see me like this. She'd never get over it; it might kill her she has spasms as it is. I'll write to her, and we'll put it in the big letter-box at the gate as we go out. Has anyone got a bit of pencil and a scrap of paper?' Gerald had a note-book, with leaves of the shiny kind which you have to write on, not with a blacklead pencil, but with an ivory thing with a point of real lead. And it won't write on any other paper except the kind that is in the book, and this is often very annoying when you are in a hurry. Then was seen the strange spectacle of a little ivory stick, with a leaden point, standing up at an odd, impossible-looking slant, and moving along all by itself as ordinary pencils do when you are writing with them 'May we look over?' asked Kathleen. There was no answer. The pencil went on writing. 'Mayn't we look over?' Kathleen said again.' Of course you may!' said the voice near the paper. 'I nodded, didn't I? Oh, I forgot, my nodding's invisible too.'T he pencil was forming round, clear letters on the page torn out of the note-book. This is what it wrote: 'DEAR AUNT, I am afraid you will not see me again for some time. A lady in a motor-car has adopted me, and we are going straight to the coast and then in a ship. It is useless to try to follow me. Farewell, and may you be happy. I hope you enjoyed the fair MABEL.' 'But that's all lies,' said Jimmy bluntly. 'No, it isn't; it's fancy,' said Mabel. 'If I said I've become invisible, she'd think that was a lie, anyhow.'' Oh, come along,' said Jimmy; 'you can quarrel just as well walking.' Gerald folded up the note as a lady in India had taught him to do years before, and Mabel led them by another and very much nearer way out of the park. And the walk home was a great deal shorter, too, than the walk out had been. The sky had clouded over while they were in the Temple of Flora, and the first spots of rain fell as they got back to the house, very late indeed for tea. Mademoiselle was looking out of the window, and came herself to open the door 'But it is that you are in lateness, in lateness!' she cried. 'You have had a misfortune no? All goes well?' 'We are very sorry indeed,' said Gerald. 'It took us longer to get home than we expected. I do hope you haven't been anxious. I have been thinking about you most of the way home.' 'Go, then,' said the French lady, smiling; 'you shall have them in the same time the tea and the supper.' Which they did. 'How could you say you were thinking about her all the time?' said a voice just by Gerald's ear, when Mademoiselle had left them alone with the bread and butter and milk and baked apples. 'It was just as much a lie as me being adopted by a motor lady.' 'No, it wasn't,' said Gerald, through bread and butter. 'I was thinking about whether she'd be in a wax or not. So there!' There were only three plates, but Jimmy let Mabel have his, and shared with Kathleen. It was rather horrid to see the bread and butter waving about in the air, and bite after bite disappearing from it apparently by no human agency; and the spoon rising with apple in it and returning to the plate empty. Even the tip of the spoon disappeared as long as it was in Mabel's unseen mouth; so that at times it looked as though its bowl had been broken off Everyone was very hungry, and more bread and butter had to be fetched. Cook grumbled when the plate was filled for the third time. 'I tell you what,' said Jimmy; 'I did want my tea.' 'I tell you what,' said Gerald; 'it'll be jolly difficult to give Mabel any breakfast. Mademoiselle will be here then. She'd have a fit if she saw bits of forks with bacon on them vanishing, and then the forks coming back out of vanishment, and the bacon lost for ever.' 'We shall have to buy things to eat and feed our poor captive in secret,' said Kathleen. 'Our money won't last long,' said Jimmy, in gloom. 'Have you got any money?' He turned to where a mug of milk was suspended in the air without visible means of support. 'I've not got much money,' was the reply from near the milk, 'but I've got heaps of ideas.' 'We must talk about everything in the morning,' said Kathleen. 'We must just say good night to Mademoiselle, and then you shall sleep in my bed, Mabel. I'll lend you one of my nightgowns.' 'I'll get my own tomorrow,' said Mabel cheerfully. 'You'll go back to get things?' 'Why not? Nobody can see me. I think I begin to see all sorts of amusing things coming along. It's not half bad being invisible.' It was extremely odd, Kathleen thought, to see the Princess's clothes coming out of nothing. First the gauzy veil appeared hanging in the air. Then the sparkling coronet suddenly showed on the top of the chest of drawers. Then a sleeve of the pinky gown showed, then another, and then the whole gown lay on the floor in a glistening ring as the unseen legs of Mabel stepped out of it. For each article of clothing became visible as Mabel took it off. The nightgown, lifted from the bed, disappeared a bit at a time. 'Get into bed,' said Kathleen, rather nervously. The bed creaked and a hollow appeared in the pillow. Kathleen put out the gas and got into bed; all this magic had been rather upsetting, and she was just the least bit frightened, but in the dark she found it was not so bad. Mabel's arms went round her neck the moment she got into bed, and the two little girls kissed in the kind darkness, where the visible and the invisible could meet on equal terms. 'Good night,' said Mabel. 'You're a darling, Cathy; you've been most awfully good to me, and I shan't forget it. I didn't like to say so before the boys, because I know boys think you're a muff if you're grateful. But I am. Good night.' Kathleen lay awake for some time. She was just getting sleepy when she remembered that the maid who would call them in the morning would see those wonderful Princess clothes. 'I'll have to get up and hide them,' she said. 'What a bother!' And as she lay thinking what a bother it was she happened to fall asleep, and when she woke again it was bright morning, and Eliza was standing in front of the chair where Mabel's clothes lay, gazing at the pink Princess-frock that lay on the top of her heap and saying, 'Law!' 'Oh, don't touch, please!' Kathleen leaped out of bed as Eliza was reaching out her hand. 'Where on earth did you get hold of that?' 'We're going to use it for acting,' said Kathleen, on the desperate inspiration of the moment. 'It's lent me for that.' 'You might show me, miss,' suggested Eliza. 'Oh, please not!' said Kathleen, standing in front of the chair in her nightgown. 'You shall see us act when we are dressed up. There! And you won't tell anyone, will you?' 'Not if you're a good little girl,' said Eliza. 'But you be sure to let me see when you do dress up. But where' Here a bell rang and Eliza had to go, for it was the postman, and she particularly wanted to see him. 'And now,' said Kathleen, pulling on her first stocking, 'we shall have to do the acting. Everything seems very difficult.' 'Acting isn't,' said Mabel; and an unsupported stocking waved in the air and quickly vanished. 'I shall love it.,' 'You forget,' said Kathleen gently, 'invisible actresses can't take part in plays unless they're magic ones.' 'Oh,' cried a voice from under a petticoat that hung in the air, 'I've got such an idea!' 'Tell it us after breakfast,' said Kathleen, as the water in the basin began to splash about and to drip from nowhere back into itself. 'And oh! I do wish you hadn't written such whoppers to your aunt. I'm sure we oughtn't to tell lies for anything.' 'What's the use of telling the truth if nobody believes you?' came from among the splashes 'I don't know,' said Kathleen, 'but I'm sure we ought to tell the truth.' 'You can, if you like,' said a voice from the folds of a towel that waved lonely in front of the wash-hand stand 'All right. We will, then, first thing after brek your brek, I mean. You'll have to wait up here till we can collar something and bring it up to you. Mind you dodge Eliza when she comes to make the bed.' The invisible Mabel found this a fairly amusing game; she further enlivened it by twitching out the corners of tucked-up sheets and blankets when Eliza wasn't looking. 'Drat the clothes!' said Eliza; 'anyone ud think the things was bewitched.' She looked about for the wonderful Princess clothes she had glimpsed earlier in the morning. But Kathleen had hidden them in a perfectly safe place under the mattress, which she knew Eliza never turned. Eliza hastily brushed up from the floor those bits of fluff which come from goodness knows where in the best regulated houses. Mabel, very hungry and exasperated at the long absence of the others at their breakfast, could not forbear to whisper suddenly in Eliza's ear: 'Always sweep under the mats.' The maid started and turned pale. 'I must be going silly,' she murmured; 'though it's just what mother always used to say. Hope I ain't going dotty, like Aunt Emily. Wonderful what you can fancy, ain't it?' She took up the hearth-rug all the same, swept under it, and under the fender. So thorough was she, and so pale, that Kathleen, entering with a chunk of bread raided by Gerald from the pantry window, exclaimed: 'Not done yet. I say, Eliza, you do look ill! What's the matter?' 'I thought I'd give the room a good turn-out,' said Eliza, still very pale. 'Nothing's happened to upset you?' Kathleen asked. She had her own private fears. 'Nothing only my fancy, miss,' said Eliza. 'I always was fanciful from a child dreaming of the pearly gates and them little angels with nothing on only their heads and wings so cheap to dress, I always think, compared with children.' When she was got rid of, Mabel ate the bread and drank water from the tooth-mug. 'I'm afraid it tastes of cherry tooth-paste rather,' said Kathleen apologetically. 'It doesn't matter,' a voice replied from the tilted mug; 'it's more interesting than water. I should think red wine in ballads was rather like this.' 'We've got leave for the day again,' said Kathleen, when the last bit of bread had vanished, 'and Gerald feels like I do about lies, So we're going to tell your aunt where you really are.' 'She won't believe you.' 'That doesn't matter, if we speak the truth,' said Kathleen primly. 'I expect you'll be sorry for it,' said Mabel; 'but come on and, I say, do be careful not to shut me in the door as you go out. You nearly did just now.' In the blazing sunlight that flooded the High Street four shadows to three children seemed dangerously noticeable. A butcher's boy looked far too earnestly at the extra shadow, and his big, liver-coloured lurcher snuffed at the legs of that shadow's mistress and whined uncomfortably. 'Get behind me,' said Kathleen; 'then our two shadows will look like one.' But Mabel's shadow, very visible, fell on Kathleen's back, and the ostler of the Davenant Arms looked up to see what big bird had cast that big shadow. A woman driving a cart with chickens and ducks in it called out: 'Halloa, missy, ain't you blacked yer back, neither! What you been leaning up against?' Everyone was glad when they got out of the town. Speaking the truth to Mabel's aunt did not turn out at all as anyone even Mabel expected. The aunt was discovered reading a pink novelette at the window of the housekeeper's room, which, framed in clematis and green creepers, looked out on a nice little courtyard to which Mabel led the party. 'Excuse me,' said Gerald, 'but I believe you've lost your niece?' 'Not lost, my boy,' said the aunt, who was spare and tall, with a drab fringe and a very genteel voice. 'We could tell you something about her,' said Gerald. 'Now,' replied the aunt, in a warning voice, 'no complaints, please. My niece has gone, and I am sure no one thinks less than I do of her little pranks. If she's played any tricks on you it's only her lighthearted way. Go away, children, I'm busy.' 'Did you get her note?' asked Kathleen. The aunt showed rather more interest than before, but she still kept her finger in the novelette. 'Oh,' she said, 'so you witnessed her departure? Did she seem glad to go?' 'Quite,' said Gerald truthfully. 'Then I can only be glad that she is provided for,' said the aunt. 'I dare say you were surprised. These romantic adventures do occur in our family. Lord Yalding selected me out of eleven applicants for the post of housekeeper here. I've not the slightest doubt the child was changed at birth and her rich relatives have claimed her.' 'But aren't you going to do anything tell the police, or' 'Shish!' said Mabel. 'I won't shish,' said Jimmy. 'Your Mabel's invisible  that's all it is. She's just beside me now.' 'I detest untruthfulness,' said the aunt severely, 'in all its forms. Will you kindly take that little boy away? I am quite satisfied about Mabel.' 'Well,' said Gerald, 'you are an aunt and no mistake! But what will Mabel's father and mother say?' 'Mabel's father and mother are dead,' said the aunt calmly, and a little sob sounded close to Gerald's ear. 'All right,' he said, 'we'll be off. But don't you go saying we didn't tell you the truth, that's all.' 'You have told me nothing,' said the aunt, 'none of you, except that little boy, who has told me a silly falsehood.' 'We meant well,' said Gerald gently. 'You don't mind our having come through the grounds, do you? we're very careful not to touch anything.' 'No visitors are allowed,' said the aunt, glancing down at her novel rather impatiently. 'Ah! but you wouldn't count us visitors,' said Gerald in his best manner. 'We re friends of Mabel's. Our father's Colonel of the th.' 'Indeed!' said the aunt. 'And our aunt's Lady Sandling, so you can be sure we wouldn't hurt anything on the estate.' 'I'm sure you wouldn't hurt a fly,' said the aunt absently. 'Good-bye. Be good children.' And on this they got away quickly. 'Why,' said Gerald, when they were outside the little court, 'your aunt's as mad as a hatter. Fancy not caring what becomes of you, and fancy believing that rot about the motor lady!' 'I knew she'd believe it when I wrote it,' said Mabel modestly. 'She's not mad, only she's always reading novelettes, I read the books in the big library. Oh, it's such a jolly room such a queer smell, like boots, and old leather books sort of powdery at the edges. I'll take you there some day. Now your consciences are all right about my aunt, I'll tell you my great idea. Let's get down to the Temple of Flora. I'm glad you got aunt's permission for the grounds. It would be so awkward for you to have to be always dodging behind bushes when one of the gardeners came along.' 'Yes,' said Gerald modestly, 'I thought of that.' The day was as bright as yesterday had been, and from the white marble temple the Italian-looking landscape looked more than ever like a steel engraving coloured by hand, or an oleographic imitation of one of Turner's pictures. When the three children were comfortably settled on the steps that led up to the white statue, the voice of the fourth child said sadly: 'I'm not ungrateful, hut I'm rather hungry. And you can't be always taking things for me through your larder window. If you like, I'll go back and live in the castle. It's supposed to be haunted. I suppose I could haunt it as well as anyone else. I am a sort of ghost now, you know. I will if you like.' 'Oh no,' said Kathleen kindly; 'you must stay with us. 'But about food. I'm not ungrateful, really I'm not, but breakfast is breakfast, and bread's only bread.' 'If you could get the ring off, you could go back.' 'Yes,' said Mabel's voice, 'but you see, I can't. I tried again last night in bed, and again this morning. And it's like stealing, taking things out of your larder even if it's only bread.' 'Yes, it is,' said Gerald, who had carried out this bold enterprise. 'Well, now, what we must do is to earn some money.' Jimmy remarked that this was all very well. But Gerald and Kathleen listened attentively. 'What I mean to say,' the voice went on, 'I'm really sure is all for the best, me being invisible. We shall have adventures you see if we don t.' 'Adventures,' said the bold buccaneer, 'are not always profitable.' It was Gerald who murmured this. 'This one will be, anyhow, you see. Only you mustn't all go. Look here, if Jerry could make himself look common ' 'That ought to be easy,' said Jimmy. And Kathleen told him not to be so jolly disagreeable. 'I'm not,' said Jimmy, 'only ' 'Only he has an inside feeling that this Mabel of yours is going to get us into trouble,' put in Gerald. 'Like La Belle Dame Sans Merci, and he does not want to be found in future ages alone and palely loitering in the middle of sedge and things.' 'I won't get you into trouble, indeed I won t,' said the voice. 'Why, we're a band of brothers for life, after the way you stood by me yesterday. What I mean is Gerald can go to the fair and do conjuring.' 'He doesn't know any,' said Kathleen. 'I should do it really,' said Mabel, 'but Jerry could look like doing it move things without touching them and all that. But it wouldn't do for all three of you to go. The more there are of children the younger they look, I think, and the more people wonder what they re doing all alone by themselves.' 'The accomplished conjurer deemed these the words of wisdom,' said Gerald; and answered the dismal 'Well, but what about us? of his brother and sister by suggesting that they should mingle unsuspected with the crowd. 'But don't let on that you know me,' he said; 'and try to look as if you belonged to some of the grown-ups at the fair. If you don't, as likely as not you'll have the kind policemen taking the little lost children by the hand and leading them home to their stricken relations French governess, I mean.' 'Let's go now,' said the voice that they never could get quite used to hearing, coming out of different parts of the air as Mabel moved from one place to another. So they went. The fair was held on a waste bit of land, about half a mile from the castle gates. When they got near enough to hear the steam-organ of the merry-go-round, Gerald suggested that as he had ninepence he should go ahead and get something to eat, the amount spent to be paid back out of any money they might make by conjuring. The others waited in the shadows of a deep-banked lane, and he came back, quite soon, though long after they had begun to say what a long time he had been gone. He brought some Barcelona nuts, red-streaked apples, small sweet yellow pears, pale pasty gingerbread, a whole quarter of a pound of peppermint bulls-eyes, and two bottles of ginger-beer. 'It's what they call an investment,' he said, when Kathleen said something about extravagance. 'We shall all need special nourishing to keep our strength up, especially the bold conjurer.' They ate and drank. It was a very beautiful meal, and the far-off music of the steam-organ added the last touch of festivity to the scene. The boys were never tired of seeing Mabel eat, or rather of seeing the strange, magic-looking vanishment of food which was all that showed of Mabel's eating. They were entranced by the spectacle, and pressed on her more than her just share of the feast, just for the pleasure of seeing it disappear. 'My aunt!' said Gerald, again and again; 'that ought to knock 'em!' It did. Jimmy and Kathleen had the start of the others, and when they got to the fair they mingled with the crowd, and were as unsuspected as possible. They stood near a large lady who was watching the Coconut shies, and presently saw a strange figure with its hands in its pockets strolling across the trampled yellowy grass among the bits of drifting paper and the sticks and straws that always litter the ground of an English fair. It was Gerald, but at first they hardly knew him. He had taken off his tie, and round his head, arranged like a turban, was the crimson school-scarf that had supported his white flannels. The tie, one supposed, had taken on the duties of the handkerchief. And his face and hands were a bright black, like very nicely polished stoves! Everyone turned to look at him. 'He's just like a conjurer!' whispered Jimmy. 'I don't suppose it'll ever come off, do you?' They followed him at a distance, and when he went close to the door of a small tent, against whose door-post a long-faced melancholy woman was lounging, they stopped and tried to look as though they belonged to a farmer who strove to send up a number by banging with a big mallet on a wooden block. Gerald went up to the woman. 'Taken much?' he asked, and was told, but not harshly, to go away with his impudence. 'I'm in business myself,' said Gerald, 'I'm a conjurer, from India.' 'Not you!' said the woman; 'you ain't no conjurer. Why, the backs of yer ears is all white.' 'Are they?' said Gerald. 'How clever of you to see that!' He rubbed them with his hands. 'That better?' 'That's all right. What's your little game?' 'Conjuring, really and truly,' said Gerald. 'There's smaller boys than me put on to it in India. Look here, I owe you one for telling me about my ears. If you like to run the show for me I'll go shares. Let me have your tent to perform in, and you do the patter at the door. 'Lor love you! I can't do no patter. And you're getting at me. Let's see you do a bit of conjuring, since you're so clever an all.' 'Right you are,' said Gerald firmly. 'You see this apple? Well, I'll make it move slowly through the air, and then when I say 'Go!' it'll vanish.' 'Yes into your mouth! Get away with your nonsense.' 'You're too clever to be so unbelieving,' said Gerald. 'Look here!' He held out one of the little apples, and the woman saw it move slowly and unsupported along the air. 'Now go!' cried Gerald, to the apple, and it went. 'How's that?' he asked, in tones of triumph. The woman was glowing with excitement, and her eyes shone. 'The best I ever see!' she whispered. 'I'm on, mate, if you know any more tricks like that.' 'Heaps,' said Gerald confidently; 'hold out your hand.' The woman held it out; and from nowhere, as it seemed, the apple appeared and was laid on her hand. The apple was rather damp. She looked at it a moment, and then whispered: 'Come on! there's to be no one in it but just us two. But not in the tent. You take a pitch here, 'longside the tent. It's worth twice the money in the open air.' 'But people won't pay if they can see it all for nothing.' 'Not for the first turn, but they will after  you see. And you'll have to do the patter.' 'Will you lend me your shawl?' Gerald asked. She unpinned it it was a red and black plaid and he spread it on the ground as he had seen Indian conjurers do, and seated himself cross-legged behind it. 'I mustn't have anyone behind me, that's all,' he said; and the woman hastily screened off a little enclosure for him by hanging old sacks to two of the guy-ropes of the tent. 'Now I'm ready, he said. The woman got a drum from the inside of the tent and beat it. Quite soon a little crowd had collected. 'Ladies and gentlemen,' said Gerald, 'I come from India, and I can do a conjuring entertainment the like of which you've never seen. When I see two shillings on the shawl I'll begin.' 'I dare say you will!' said a bystander; and there were several short, disagreeable laughs. 'Of course,' said Gerald, 'if you can't afford two shillings between you' there were about thirty people in the crowd by now 'I say no more.' Two or three pennies fell on the shawl, then a few more then the fall of copper ceased. 'Ninepence,' said Gerald. 'Well, I've got a generous nature. You'll get such a ninepennyworth as you've never had before. I don't wish to deceive you I have an accomplice, but my accomplice is invisible.' The crowd snorted. 'By the aid of that accomplice,' Gerald went on, 'I will read any letter that any of you may have in your pocket. If one of you will just step over the rope and stand beside me, my invisible accomplice will read that letter over his shoulder.' A man stepped forward, a ruddy-faced, horsy-looking person. He pulled a letter from his pocket and stood plain in the sight of all, in a place where everyone saw that no one could see over his shoulder. 'Now!' said Gerald. There was a moment's pause. Then from quite the other side of the enclosure came a faint, faraway, sing-song voice. It said: 'SIR Yours of the fifteenth duly to hand. With regard to the mortgage on your land, we regret our inability ' 'Stow it!' cried the man, turning threateningly on Gerald. He stepped out of the enclosure explaining that there was nothing of that sort in his letter; but nobody believed him, and a buzz of interested chatter began in the crowd, ceasing abruptly when Gerald began to speak. 'Now,' said he, laying the nine pennies down on the shawl, 'you keep your eyes on those pennies, and one by one you'll see them disappear.' And of course they did. Then one by one they were laid down again by the invisible hand of Mabel. The crowd clapped loudly. 'Bravo!' 'That's something like!' 'Show us another!' cried the people in the front rank. And those behind pushed forward. 'Now,' said Gerald, 'you've seen what I can do, but I don't do any more till I see five shillings on this carpet.' And in two minutes seven-and-threepence lay there and Gerald did a little more conjuring. When the people in front didn't want to give any more money, Gerald asked them to stand back and let the others have a look in. I wish I had time to tell you of all the tricks he did the grass round his enclosure was absolutely trampled off by the feet of the people who thronged to look at him. There is really hardly any limit to the wonders you can do if you have an invisible accomplice. All sorts of things were made to move about, apparently by themselves, and even to vanish into the folds of Mabel's clothing. The woman stood by, looking more and more pleasant as she saw the money come tumbling in, and beating her shabby drum every time Gerald stopped conjuring. The news of the conjurer had spread all over the fair. The crowd was frantic with admiration. The man who ran the coconut shies begged Gerald to throw in his lot with him; the owner of the rifle gallery offered him free board and lodging and go shares; and a brisk, broad lady, in stiff black silk and a violet bonnet, tried to engage him for the forthcoming Bazaar for Reformed Bandsmen. And all this time the others mingled with the crowd  quite unobserved, for who could have eyes for anyone but Gerald? It was getting quite late, long past tea-time, and Gerald, who was getting very tired indeed, and was quite satisfied with his share of the money, was racking his brains for a way to get out of it. 'How are we to hook it?' he murmured, as Mabel made his cap disappear from his head by the simple process of taking it off and putting it in her pocket. 'They'll never let us get away. I didn't think of that before.' 'Let me think!' whispered Mabel; and next moment she said, close to his ear: 'Divide the money, and give her something for the shawl. Put the money on it and say. . .' She told him what to say. Gerald's pitch was in the shade of the tent; otherwise, of course, everyone would have seen the shadow of the invisible Mabel as she moved about making things vanish. Gerald told the woman to divide the money, which she did honestly enough. 'Now,' he said, while the impatient crowd pressed closer and closer, 'I'll give you five bob for your shawl. 'Seven-and-six,' said the woman mechanically. 'Righto!' said Gerald, putting his heavy share of the money in his trouser pocket. 'This shawl will now disappear,' he said, picking it up. He handed it to Mabel, who put it on; and, of course, it disappeared. A roar of applause went up from the audience. 'Now,' he said, 'I come to the last trick of all. I shall take three steps backwards and vanish. He took three steps backwards, Mabel wrapped the invisible shawl round him, and he did not vanish. The shawl, being invisible, did not conceal him in the least. 'Yah!' cried a boy's voice in the crowd. 'Look at 'im! 'E knows 'e can't do it.' 'I wish I could put you in my pocket,' said Mabel. The crowd was crowding closer. At any moment they might touch Mabel, and then anything might happen  simply anything. Gerald took hold of his hair with both hands, as his way was when he was anxious or discouraged. Mabel, in invisibility, wrung her hands, as people are said to do in books  that is, she clasped them and squeezed very tight. 'Oh!' she whispered suddenly, 'it's loose. I can get it off.' 'Not ' 'Yes the ring.' 'Come on, young master. Give us summat for our money,' a farm labourer shouted. 'I will,' said Gerald. 'This time I really will vanish. Slip round into the tent,' he whispered to Mabel. 'Push the ring under the canvas. Then slip out at the back and join the others. When I see you with them I'll disappear. Go slow, and I'll catch you up.' 'It's me,' said a pale and obvious Mabel in the ear of Kathleen. 'He's got the ring; come on, before the crowd begins to scatter.' As they went out of the gate they heard a roar of surprise and annoyance rise from the crowd, and knew that this time Gerald really had disappeared. They had gone a mile before they heard footsteps on the road, and looked back. No one was to be seen. Next moment Gerald's voice spoke out of clear, empty-looking space. 'Halloa!' it said gloomily. 'How horrid!' cried Mabel; 'you did make me jump! Take the ring off; it makes me feel quite creepy, you being nothing but a voice.' 'So did you us,' said Jimmy. 'Don't take it off yet,' said Kathleen, who was really rather thoughtful for her age, 'because you're still blackleaded, I suppose, and you might be recognized, and eloped with by gypsies, so that you should go on doing conjuring for ever and ever.' 'I should take it off,' said Jimmy; 'it's no use going about invisible, and people seeing us with Mabel and saying we've eloped with her.' 'Yes,' said Mabel impatiently, 'that would be simply silly. And, besides, I want my ring.' 'It's not yours any more than ours, anyhow,' said Jimmy. 'Yes, it is,' said Mabel. 'Oh, stow it!' said the weary voice of Gerald beside her. 'What's the use of jawing?' 'I want the ring,' said Mabel, rather mulishly. 'Want' the words came out of the still evening air  'want must be your master. You can't have the ring. I can't get it off!' The difficulty was not only that Gerald had got the ring on and couldn't get it off, and was therefore invisible, but that Mabel, who had been invisible and therefore possible to be smuggled into the house, was now plain to be seen and impossible for smuggling purposes. The children would have not only to account for the apparent absence of one of themselves, but for the obvious presence of a perfect stranger. 'I can't go back to aunt. I can't and I won't,' said Mabel firmly, 'not if I was visible twenty times over.' 'She'd smell a rat if you did,' Gerald owned 'about the motor-car, I mean, and the adopting lady. And what we're to say to Mademoiselle about you !' He tugged at the ring. 'Suppose you told the truth,' said Mabel meaningly. 'She wouldn't believe it,' said Cathy; 'or, if she did, she'd go stark, staring, raving mad.' 'No,' said Gerald's voice, 'we daren't tell her. But she's really rather decent. Let's ask her to let you stay the night because it's too late for you to get home.' 'That's all right,' said Jimmy, 'but what about you?' 'I shall go to bed,' said Gerald, 'with a bad headache. Oh, that's not a lie! I've got one right enough. It's the sun, I think. I know blacklead attracts the concentration of the sun.' 'More likely the pears and the gingerbread,' said Jimmy unkindly. 'Well, let's get along. I wish it was me was invisible. I'd do something different from going to bed with a silly headache, I know that.' 'What would you do?' asked the voice of Gerald just behind him. 'Do keep in one place, you silly cuckoo!' said Jimmy. 'You make me feel all jumpy. He had indeed jumped rather violently. 'Here, walk between Cathy and me. 'What would you do?' repeated Gerald, from that apparently unoccupied position. 'I'd be a burglar,' said Jimmy. Cathy and Mabel in one breath reminded him how wrong burgling was, and Jimmy replied: 'Well, then a detective.' 'There's got to be something to detect before you can begin detectiving,' said Mabel. 'Detectives don't always detect things,' said Jimmy, very truly. 'If I couldn't be any other kind I'd be a baffled detective. You could be one all right, and have no end of larks just the same. Why don't you do it?' 'It's exactly what I am going to do,' said Gerald. 'We'll go round by the police-station and see what they've got in the way of crimes.' They did, and read the notices on the board outside. Two dogs had been lost, a purse, and a portfolio of papers 'of no value to any but the owner.' Also Houghton Grange had been broken into and a quantity of silver plate stolen. 'Twenty pounds reward offered for any information that may lead to the recovery of the missing property.' 'That burglary's my lay,' said Gerald; 'I'll detect that. Here comes Johnson,' he added; 'he's going off duty. Ask him about it. The fell detective, being invisible, was unable to pump the constable, but the young brother of our hero made the inquiries in quite a creditable manner. Be creditable, Jimmy.' Jimmy hailed the constable. 'Halloa, Johnson!' he said. And Johnson replied: 'Halloa, young shaver!' 'Shaver yourself!' said Jimmy, but without malice. 'What are you doing this time of night?' the constable asked jocosely. 'All the dicky birds is gone to their little nesteses.' 'We've been to the fair,' said Kathleen. 'There was a conjurer there. I wish you could have seen him.' 'Heard about him,' said Johnson; 'all fake, you know. The quickness of the 'and deceives the hi.' Such is fame. Gerald, standing in the shadow, jingled the loose money in his pocket to console himself. 'What's that?' the policeman asked quickly. 'Our money jingling,' said Jimmy, with perfect truth. 'It's well to be some people,' Johnson remarked; 'wish I'd got my pockets full to jingle with.' 'Well, why haven't you?' asked Mabel. 'Why don't you get that twenty pounds reward?' 'I'll tell you why I don't. Because in this 'ere realm of liberty, and Britannia ruling the waves, you ain't allowed to arrest a chap on suspicion, even if you know puffickly well who done the job.' 'What a shame!' said Jimmy warmly. 'And who do you think did it?' 'I don't think I know.' Johnson's voice was ponderous as his boots. 'It's a man what's known to the police on account of a heap o crimes he's done, but we never can't bring it 'ome to 'im, nor yet get sufficient evidence to convict.' 'Well, said Jimmy, 'when I've left school I'll come to you and be apprenticed, and be a detective. Just now I think we'd better get home and detect our supper. Good night!' They watched the policeman's broad form disappear through the swing door of the police-station; and as it settled itself into quiet again the voice of Gerald was heard complaining bitterly. 'You've no more brains than a halfpenny bun,' he said; 'no details about how and when the silver was taken.' 'But he told us he knew,' Jimmy urged. 'Yes, that's all you've got out of him. A silly policeman's silly idea. Go home and detect your precious supper! It's all you're fit for.' 'What'll you do about supper?' Mabel asked. 'Buns!' said Gerald, 'halfpenny buns. They'll make me think of my dear little brother and sister. Perhaps you've got enough sense to buy buns? I can't go into a shop in this state.' 'Don't you be so disagreeable,' said Mabel with spirit. 'We did our best. If I were Cathy you should whistle for your nasty buns.' 'If you were Cathy the gallant young detective would have left home long ago. Better the cabin of a tramp steamer than the best family mansion that's got a brawling sister in it,' said Gerald. 'You are a bit of an outsider at present, my gentle maiden. Jimmy and Cathy know well enough when their bold leader is chaffing and when he isn't. 'Not when we can't see your face we don't,' said Cathy, in tones of relief. 'I really thought you were in a flaring wax, and so did Jimmy, didn't you?' 'Oh, rot!' said Gerald. 'Come on! This way to the bun shop.' They went, And it was while Cathy and Jimmy were in the shop and the others were gazing through the glass at the jam tarts and Swiss rolls and Victoria sandwiches and Bath buns under the spread yellow muslin in the window, that Gerald discoursed in Mabel's ear of the plans and hopes of one entering on a detective career. 'I shall keep my eyes open tonight, I can tell you,' he began. 'I shall keep my eyes skinned, and no jolly error. The invisible detective may not only find out about the purse and the silver, but detect some crime that isn't even done yet. And I shall hang about until I see some suspicious-looking characters leave the town, and follow them furtively and catch them red-handed, with their hands full of priceless jewels, and hand them over.' 'Oh!' cried Mabel, so sharply and suddenly that Gerald was roused from his dream to express sympathy. 'Pain?' he said quite kindly. 'It's the apples they were rather hard.' 'Oh, it's not that,' said Mabel very earnestly. 'Oh, how awful! I never thought of that before.' 'Never thought of what?' Gerald asked impatiently. 'The window.' 'What window?' 'The panelled-room window. At home, you know at the castle. That settles it I must go home. We left it open and the shutters as well, and all the jewels and things there. Auntie'll never go in; she never does. That settles it; I must go home now this minute.' Here the others issued from the shop, bun-bearing, and the situation was hastily explained to them. 'So you see I must go,' Mabel ended. And Kathleen agreed that she must. But Jimmy said he didn't see what good it would do. 'Because the key's inside the door, anyhow.' 'She will be cross,' said Mabel sadly. 'She'll have to get the gardeners to get a ladder and ' 'Hooray!' said Gerald. 'Here's me! Nobler and more secret than gardeners or ladders was the invisible Jerry. I'll climb in at the window it's all ivy, I know I could and shut the window and the shutters all sereno, put the key back on the nail, and slip out unperceived the back way, threading my way through the maze of unconscious retainers. There'll be plenty of time. I don't suppose burglars begin their fell work until the night is far advanced.' 'Won't you be afraid?' Mabel asked. 'Will it be safe  suppose you were caught?' 'As houses. I can't be,' Gerald answered, and wondered that the question came from Mabel and not from Kathleen, who was usually inclined to fuss a little annoyingly about the danger and folly of adventures. But all Kathleen said was, 'Well, good-bye; we'll come and see you tomorrow, Mabel. The floral temple at half-past ten. I hope you won't get into an awful row about the motor-car lady.' 'Let's detect our supper now,' said Jimmy. 'All right,' said Gerald a little bitterly. It is hard to enter on an adventure like this and to find the sympathetic interest of years suddenly cut off at the meter, as it were. Gerald felt that he ought, at a time like this, to have been the centre of interest. And he wasn't. They could actually talk about supper. Well, let them. He didn't care! He spoke with sharp sternness: 'Leave the pantry window undone for me to get in by when I've done my detecting. Come on, Mabel.' He caught her hand. 'Bags I the buns, though,' he added, by a happy afterthought, and snatching the bag, pressed it on Mabel, and the sound of four boots echoed on the pavement of the High Street as the outlines of the running Mabel grew small with distance. Mademoiselle was in the drawing-room. She was sitting by the window in the waning light reading letters. 'Ah, vous voici!' she said unintelligibly. 'You are again late; and my little Gerald, where is he?' This was an awful moment. Jimmy's detective scheme had not included any answer to this inevitable question. The silence was unbroken till Jimmy spoke. 'He said he was going to bed because he had a headache.' And this, of course, was true. 'This poor Gerald!' said Mademoiselle. 'Is it that I should mount him some supper?' 'He never eats anything when he's got one of his headaches,' Kathleen said. And this also was the truth. Jimmy and Kathleen Went to bed, wholly untroubled by anxiety about their brother, and Mademoiselle pulled out the bundle of letters and read them amid the ruins of the simple supper. 'It is ripping being out late like this,' said Gerald through the soft summer dusk. 'Yes,' said Mabel, a solitary-looking figure plodding along the high-road. 'I do hope auntie won't be very furious.' 'Have another bun,' suggested Gerald kindly, and a sociable munching followed. It was the aunt herself who opened to a very pale and trembling Mabel the door which is appointed for the entrances and exits of the domestic staff at Yalding Towers. She looked over Mabel's head first, as if she expected to see someone taller. Then a very small voice said: 'Aunt!' The aunt started back, then made a step towards Mabel. 'You naughty, naughty girl!' she cried angrily; 'how could you give me such a fright? I've a good mind to keep you in bed for a week for this, miss. Oh, Mabel, thank Heaven you're safe!' And with that the aunt's arms went round Mabel and Mabel's round the aunt in such a hug as they had never met in before. 'But you didn't seem to care a bit this morning,' said Mabel, when she had realized that her aunt really had been anxious, really was glad to have her safe home again. 'How do you know?' 'I was there listening. Don't be angry, auntie.' 'I feel as if I could never be angry with you again, now I've got you safe,' said the aunt surprisingly. 'But how was it?' Mabel asked. 'My dear,' said the aunt impressively, 'I've been in a sort of trance. I think I must be going to be ill. I've always been fond of you, but I didn't want to spoil you. But yesterday, about half-past three, I was talking about you to Mr. Lewson, at the fair, and quite suddenly I felt as if you didn't matter at all. And I felt the same when I got your letter and when those children came. And today in the middle of tea I suddenly woke up and realized that you were gone. It was awful. I think I must be going to be ill. Oh, Mabel, why did you do it?' 'It was a joke,' said Mabel feebly. And then the two went in and the door was shut. 'That's most uncommon odd,' said Gerald, outside; 'looks like more magic to me. I don't feel as if we d got to the bottom of this yet, by any manner of means. There's more about this castle than meets the eye.' There certainly was. For this castle happened to be  but it would not be fair to Gerald to tell you more about it than he knew on that night when he went alone and invisible through the shadowy great grounds of it to look for the open window of the panelled room. He knew that night no more than I have told you; but as he went along the dewy lawns and through the groups of shrubs and trees, where pools lay like giant looking-glasses reflecting the quiet stars, and the white limbs of statues gleamed against a background of shadow, he began to feel well, not excited, not surprised, not anxious, but different. The incident of the invisible Princess had surprised, the incident of the conjuring had excited, and the sudden decision to be a detective had brought its own anxieties; but all these happenings, though wonderful and unusual, had seemed to be, after all, inside the circle of possible things wonderful as the chemical experiments are where two liquids poured together make fire, surprising as legerdemain, thrilling as a juggler's display, but nothing more. Only now a new feeling came to him as he walked through those gardens; by day those gardens were like dreams, at night they were like visions. He could not see his feet as he walked, but he saw the movement of the dewy grass-blades that his feet displaced. And he had that extraordinary feeling so difficult to describe, and yet so real and so unforgettable the feeling that he was in another world, that had covered up and hidden the old world as a carpet covers a floor. The floor was there all right, underneath, but what he walked on was the carpet that covered it and that carpet was drenched in magic, as the turf was drenched in dew. The feeling was very wonderful; perhaps you will feel it some day. There are still some places in the world where it can be felt, but they grow fewer every year. The enchantment of the garden held him. 'I'll not go in yet,' he told himself; 'it's too early. And perhaps I shall never be here at night again. I suppose it is the night that makes everything look so different.' Something white moved under a weeping willow; white hands parted the long, rustling leaves. A white figure came out, a creature with horns and goat's legs and the head and arms of a boy. And Gerald was not afraid. That was the most wonderful thing of all, though he would never have owned it. The white thing stretched its limbs, rolled on the grass, righted itself and frisked away across the lawn. Still something white gleamed under the willow; three steps nearer and Gerald saw that it was the pedestal of a statue empty. 'They come alive,' he said; and another white shape came out of the Temple of Flora and disappeared in the laurels. 'The statues come alive.' There was a crunching of the little stones in the gravel of the drive. Something enormously long and darkly grey came crawling towards him, slowly, heavily. The moon came out just in time to show its shape. It was one of those great lizards that you see at the Crystal Palace, made in stone, of the same awful size which they were millions of years ago when they were masters of the world, before Man was. 'It can't see me,' said Gerald. 'I am not afraid. It's come to life, too.' As it writhed past him he reached out a hand and touched the side of its gigantic tail. It was of stone. It had not 'come alive' as he had fancied, but was alive in its stone. It turned, however, at the touch; but Gerald also had turned, and was running with all his speed towards the house. Because at that stony touch Fear had come into the garden and almost caught him. It was Fear that he ran from, and not the moving stone beast. He stood panting under the fifth window; when he had climbed to the window-ledge by the twisted ivy that clung to the wall, he looked back over the grey slope there was a splashing at the fish-pool that had mirrored the stars the shape of the great stone beast was wallowing in the shallows among the lily-pads. Once inside the room, Gerald turned for another look. The fish-pond lay still and dark, reflecting the moon. Through a gap in the drooping willow the moonlight fell on a statue that stood calm and motionless on its pedestal. Everything was in its place now in the garden. Nothing moved or stirred. 'How extraordinarily rum!' said Gerald. 'I shouldn't have thought you could go to sleep walking through a garden and dream like that.' He shut the window, lit a match, and closed the shutters. Another match showed him the door. He turned the key, went out, locked the door again, hung the key on its usual nail, and crept to the end of the passage. Here he waited, safe in his invisibility, till the dazzle of the matches should have gone from his eyes, and he be once more able to find his way by the moonlight that fell in bright patches on the floor through the barred, unshuttered windows of the hall. 'Wonder where the kitchen is,' said Gerald. He had quite forgotten that he was a detective. He was only anxious to get home and tell the others about that extraordinarily odd dream that he had had in the gardens. 'I suppose it doesn't matter what doors I open. I'm invisible all right still, I suppose? Yes; can't see my hand before my face.' He held up a hand for the purpose. 'Here goes!' He opened many doors, wandered into long rooms with furniture dressed in brown holland covers that looked white in that strange light, rooms with chandeliers hanging in big bags from the high ceilings, rooms whose walls were alive with pictures, rooms whose walls were deadened with rows on rows of old books, state bedrooms in whose great plumed four-posters Queen Elizabeth had no doubt slept. (That Queen, by the way, must have been very little at home, for she seems to have slept in every old house in England.) But he could not find the kitchen. At last a door opened on stone steps that went up there was a narrow stone passage steps that went down a door with a light under it. It was, somehow, difficult to put out one's hand to that door and open it. 'Nonsense!' Gerald told himself, 'don't be an ass! Are you invisible, or aren't you?' Then he opened the door, and someone inside said something in a sudden rough growl. Gerald stood back, flattened against the wall, as a man sprang to the doorway and flashed a lantern into the passage. 'All right,' said the man, with almost a sob of relief. 'It was only the door swung open, it's that heavy that's all.' 'Blow the door!' said another growling voice; 'blessed if I didn't think it was a fair cop that time.' They closed the door again. Gerald did not mind. In fact, he rather preferred that it should be so. He didn't like the look of those men. There was an air of threat about them. In their presence even invisibility seemed too thin a disguise. And Gerald had seen as much as he wanted to see. He had seen that he had been right about the gang. By wonderful luck  beginner's luck, a card-player would have told him he had discovered a burglary on the very first night of his detective career. The men were taking silver out of two great chests, wrapping it in rags, and packing it in baize sacks. The door of the room was of iron six inches thick. It was, in fact, the strong-room, and these men had picked the lock. The tools they had done it with lay on the floor, on a neat cloth roll, such as wood-carvers keep their chisels in. 'Hurry up!' Gerald heard. 'You needn't take all night over it.' The silver rattled slightly. 'You're a rattling of them trays like bloomin' castanets,' said the gruffest voice. Gerald turned and went away, very carefully and very quickly. And it is a most curious thing that, though he couldn't find the way to the servants wing when he had nothing else to think of, yet now, with his mind full, so to speak, of silver forks and silver cups, and the question of who might be coming after him down those twisting passages, he went straight as an arrow to the door that led from the hall to the place he wanted to get to. As he went the happenings took words in his mind. 'The fortunate detective,' he told himself, 'having succeeded beyond his wildest dreams, himself left the spot in search of assistance.' But what assistance? There were, no doubt, men in the house, also the aunt; but he could not warn them. He was too hopelessly invisible to carry any weight with strangers. The assistance of Mabel would not be of much value. The police? Before they could be got and the getting of them presented difficulties the burglars would have cleared away with their sacks of silver. Gerald stopped and thought hard; he held his head with both hands to do it. You know the way the same as you sometimes do for simple equations or the dates of the battles of the Civil War. Then with pencil, note-book, a window-ledge, and all the cleverness he could find at the moment, he wrote: 'You know the room where the silver is. Burglars are burgling it, the thick door is picked. Send a man for police. I will follow the burglars if they get away ere police arrive on the spot.' He hesitated a moment, and ended 'From a Friend this is not a sell.' This letter, tied tightly round a stone by means of a shoelace, thundered through the window of the room where Mabel and her aunt, in the ardour of reunion, were enjoying a supper of unusual charm stewed plums, cream, sponge-cakes, custard in cups, and cold bread-and-butter pudding. Gerald, in hungry invisibility, looked wistfully at the supper before he threw the stone. He waited till the shrieks had died away, saw the stone picked up, the warning letter read. 'Nonsense!' said the aunt, growing calmer. 'How wicked! Of course it's a hoax.' 'Oh! do send for the police, like he says,' wailed Mabel. 'Like who says?' snapped the aunt. 'Whoever it is,' Mabel moaned. 'Send for the police at once,' said Gerald, outside, in the manliest voice he could find. 'You'll only blame yourself if you don t. I can't do any more for you.' 'I I'll set the dogs on you!' cried the aunt. 'Oh, auntie, don't!' Mabel was dancing with agitation. 'It's true I know it's true. Do do wake Bates!' 'I don't believe a word of it,' said the aunt. No more did Bates when, owing to Mabel's persistent worryings, he was awakened. But when he had seen the paper, and had to choose whether he'd go to the strong-room and see that there really wasn't anything to believe or go for the police on his bicycle, he chose the latter course. When the police arrived the strong-room door stood ajar, and the silver, or as much of it as the three men could carry, was gone. Gerald's note-book and pencil came into play again later on that night. It was five in the morning before he crept into bed, tired out and cold as a stone. 'Master Gerald!' it was Eliza's voice in his ears 'it's seven o clock and another fine day, and there's been another burglary My cats alive!' she screamed, as she drew up the blind and turned towards the bed; 'look at his bed, all crocked with black, and him not there!' 'Oh, Jiminy!' It was a scream this time. Kathleen came running from her room; Jimmy sat up in his bed and rubbed his eyes. 'Whatever is it?' Kathleen cried. 'I dunno when I 'ad such a turn. Eliza sat down heavily on a box as she spoke. 'First thing his bed all empty and black as the chimley back, and him not in it, and then when I looks again he is in it all the time. I must be going silly. I thought as much when I heard them haunting angel voices yesterday morning. But I'll tell Mamselle of you, my lad, with your tricks, you may rely on that. Blacking yourself all over and crocking up your clean sheets and pillow-cases. It's going back of beyond, this is.' 'Look here,' said Gerald slowly; 'I'm going to tell you something.' Eliza simply snorted, and that was rude of her; but then, she had had a shock and had not got over it. 'Can you keep a secret?' asked Gerald, very earnest through the grey of his partly rubbed-off blacklead. 'Yes,' said Eliza. 'Then keep it and I'll give you two bob.' 'But what was you going to tell me?' 'That. About the two bob and the secret. And you keep your mouth shut.' 'I didn't ought to take it,' said Eliza, holding out her hand eagerly. 'Now you get up, and mind you wash all the corners, Master Gerald.' 'Oh, I'm so glad you're safe,' said Kathleen, when Eliza had gone. 'You didn't seem to care much last night,' said Gerald coldly. 'I can't think how I let you go. I didn't care last night. But when I woke this morning and remembered!' 'There, that'll do it'll come off on you,' said Gerald through the reckless hugging of his sister. 'How did you get visible?' Jimmy asked. 'It just happened when she called me the ring came off.' 'Tell us all about everything,' said Kathleen. 'Not yet, said Gerald mysteriously. 'Where's the ring?' Jimmy asked after breakfast. 'I want to have a try now.' 'I I forgot it,' said Gerald; 'I expect it's in the bed somewhere. But it wasn't. Eliza had made the bed. 'I'll swear there ain't no ring there,' she said. 'I should 'a seen it if there had'a been.' 'Search and research proving vain,' said Gerald, when every corner of the bedroom had been turned out and the ring had not been found, 'the noble detective hero of our tale remarked that he would have other fish to fry in half a jiff, and if the rest of you want to hear about last night...' 'Let's keep it till we get to Mabel,' said Kathleen heroically. 'The assignation was ten-thirty, wasn't it? Why shouldn't Gerald gas as we go along? I don't suppose anything very much happened, anyhow.' This, of course, was Jimmy. 'That shows,' remarked Gerald sweetly, 'how much you know. The melancholy Mabel will await the tryst without success, as far as this one is concerned.' 'Fish, fish, other fish other fish I fry!'' he warbled to the tune of 'Cherry Ripe' , till Kathleen could have pinched him. Jimmy turned coldly away, remarking, 'When you've quite done.' But Gerald went on singing 'Where the lips of Johnson smile, There's the land of Cherry Isle. Other fish, other fish, Fish I fry. Stately Johnson, come and buy!' 'How can you,' asked Kathleen, 'be so aggravating?' 'I don't know,' said Gerald, returning to prose. 'Want of sleep or intoxication of success, I mean. Come where no one can hear us. 'Oh, come to some island where no one can hear, And beware of the keyhole that's glued to an ear,'' he whispered, opened the door suddenly, and there, sure enough, was Eliza, stooping without. She flicked feebly at the wainscot with a duster, but concealment was vain. 'You know what listeners never hear,' said Jimmy severely. 'I didn't, then so there!' said Eliza, whose listening ears were crimson. So they passed out, and up the High Street, to sit on the churchyard wall and dangle their legs. And all the way Gerald's lips were shut into a thin, obstinate line. 'Now,' said Kathleen. 'Oh, Jerry, don't be a goat! I'm simply dying to hear what happened.' 'That's better,' said Gerald, and he told his story. As he told it some of the white mystery and magic of the moonlit gardens got into his voice and his words, so that when he told of the statues that came alive, and the great beast that was alive through all its stone, Kathleen thrilled responsive, clutching his arm, and even Jimmy ceased to kick the wall with his boot heels, and listened open-mouthed. Then came the thrilling tale of the burglars, and the warning letter flung into the peaceful company of Mabel, her aunt, and the bread-and-butter pudding. Gerald told the story with the greatest enjoyment and such fullness of detail that the church clock chimed half-past eleven as he said, 'Having done all that human agency could do, and further help being despaired of, our gallant young detective Hullo, there's Mabel!' There was. The tail-board of a cart shed her almost at their feet. 'I couldn't wait any longer,' she explained, 'when you didn't come. And I got a lift. Has anything more happened?' The burglars had gone when Bates got to the strong-room. 'You don't mean to say all that wheeze is real?' Jimmy asked. 'Of course it's real,' said Kathleen. 'Go on, Jerry. He's just got to where he threw the stone into your bread-and-butter pudding, Mabel. Go on. Mabel climbed on to the wall. 'You've got visible again quicker than I did,' she said. Gerald nodded and resumed: 'Our story must be told in as few words as possible, owing to the fish-frying taking place at twelve, and it's past the half-hour now. Having left his missive to do its warning work, Gerald de Sherlock Holmes sped back, wrapped in invisibility, to the spot where by the light of their dark-lanterns the burglars were still still burgling with the utmost punctuality and despatch. I didn't see any sense in running into danger, so I just waited outside the passage where the steps are you know?' Mabel nodded. 'Presently they came out, very cautiously, of course, and looked about them. They didn't see me so deeming themselves unobserved they passed in silent Indian file along the passage one of the sacks of silver grazed my front part and out into the night.' 'But which way?' 'Through the little looking-glass room where you looked at yourself when you were invisible. The hero followed swiftly on his invisible tennis-shoes. The three miscreants instantly sought the shelter of the groves and passed stealthily among the rhododendrons and across the park, and his voice dropped and he looked straight before him at the pinky convolvulus netting a heap of stones beyond the white dust of the road 'the stone things that come alive, they kept looking out from between bushes and under trees and I saw them all right, but they didn't see me. They saw the burglars though, right enough; but the burglars couldn't see them. Rum, wasn't it?' 'The stone things?' Mabel had to have them explained to her. 'I never saw them come alive,' she said, 'and I've been in the gardens in the evening as often as often. 'I saw them,' said Gerald stiffly. 'I know, I know,' Mabel hastened to put herself right with him; 'what I mean to say is I shouldn't wonder if they re only visible when you're invisible the liveness of them, I mean, not the stoniness.' Gerald understood, and I'm sure I hope you do. 'I shouldn't wonder if you're right,' he said. 'The castle garden's enchanted right enough; but what I should like to know is how and why. I say, come on, I've got to catch Johnson before twelve. We'll walk as far as the market and then we'll have to run for it.' 'But go on with the adventure,' said Mabel. 'You can talk as we go.' 'Oh, do it is so awfully thrilling!' This pleased Gerald, of course. 'Well, I just followed, you know, like in a dream, and they got out the cavy way you know, where we got in and I jolly well thought I d lost them; I had to wait till they'd moved off down the road so that they shouldn't hear me rattling the stones, and I had to tear to catch them up. I took my shoes off I expect my stockings are done for. And I followed and followed and followed and they went through the place where the poor people live, and right down to the river. And I say, we must run for it.' So the story stopped and the running began. They caught Johnson in his own back-yard washing at a bench against his own back-door. 'Look here, Johnson,' Gerald said, 'what'll you give me if I put you up to winning that fifty pounds reward?' 'Halves,' said Johnson promptly, 'and a clout 'long-side your head if you was coming any of your nonsense over me.' 'It's not nonsense,' said Gerald very impressively. 'If you'll let us in I'll tell you all about it. And when you've caught the burglars and got the swag back you just give me a quid for luck. I won't ask for more.' 'Come along in, then,' said Johnson, 'if the young ladies'll excuse the towel. But I bet you do want something more off of me. Else why not claim the reward yourself?' 'Great is the wisdom of Johnson he speaks winged words.' The children were all in the cottage now, and the door was shut. 'I want you never to let on who told you. Let them think it was your own unaided pluck and far-sightedness.' 'Sit you down,' said Johnson, 'and if you're kidding you'd best send the little gells home afore I begin on you.' 'I am not kidding,' replied Gerald loftily, 'never less. And anyone but a policeman would see why I don't want anyone to know it was me. I found it out at dead of night, in a place where I wasn't supposed to be; and there'd be a beastly row if they found out at home about me being out nearly all night. Now do you see, my bright-eyed daisy?' Johnson was now too interested, as Jimmy said afterwards, to mind what silly names he was called. He said he did see and asked to see more. 'Well, don't you ask any questions, then. I'll tell you all it's good for you to know. Last night about eleven I was at Yalding Towers. No it doesn't matter how I got there or what I got there for and there was a window open and I got in, and there was a light. And it was in the strong-room, and there were three men, putting silver in a bag.' 'Was it you give the warning, and they sent for the police?' Johnson was leaning eagerly forward, a hand on each knee. 'Yes, that was me. You can let them think it was you, if you like. You were off duty, weren't you?' 'I was,' said Johnson, 'in the arms of Murphy ' 'Well, the police didn't come quick enough. But I was there a lonely detective. And I followed them.' 'You did?' 'And I saw them hide the booty and I know the other stuff from Houghton's Court's in the same place, and I heard them arrange about when to take it away.' 'Come and show me where,' said Johnson, jumping up so quickly that his Windsor arm-chair fell over backwards, with a crack, on the red-brick floor. 'Not so,' said Gerald calmly; 'if you go near the spot before the appointed time you'll find the silver, but you'll never catch the thieves.' 'You're right there.' The policeman picked up his chair and sat down in it again. 'Well?' 'Well, there's to be a motor to meet them in the lane beyond the boat-house by Sadler's Rents at one o clock tonight. They'll get the things out at half-past twelve and take them along in a boat. So now's your chance to fill your pockets with chink and cover yourself with honour and glory.' 'So help me!' Johnson was pensive and doubtful still 'So help me! you couldn't have made all this up out of your head.' 'Oh yes, I could. But I didn't. Now look here. It's the chance of your lifetime, Johnson! A quid for me, and a still tongue for you, and the job's done. Do you agree?' 'Oh, I agree right enough,' said Johnson. 'I agree. But if you're coming any of your larks ' 'Can't you see he isn't?' Kathleen put in impatiently. 'He's not a liar we none of us are.' 'If you're not on, say so,' said Gerald, 'and I'll find another policeman with more sense.' 'I could split about you being out all night,' said Johnson. 'But you wouldn't be so ungentlemanly,' said Mabel brightly. 'Don't you be so unbelieving, when we're trying to do you a good turn.' 'If I were you,' Gerald advised, 'I'd go to the place where the silver is, with two other men. You could make a nice little ambush in the wood-yard it's close there. And I'd have two or three more men up trees in the lane to wait for the motor-car.' 'You ought to have been in the force, you ought,' said Johnson admiringly; 'but s'pose it was a hoax!' 'Well, then you'd have made an ass of yourself I don't suppose it ud be the first time,' said Jimmy. 'Are you on?' said Gerald in haste. 'Hold your jaw, Jimmy, you idiot!' 'Yes,' said Johnson. 'Then when you're on duty you go down to the wood-yard, and the place where you see me blow my nose is the place. The sacks are tied with string to the posts under the water. You just stalk by in your dignified beauty and make a note of the spot. That's where glory waits you, and when Fame elates you and you're a sergeant, please remember me.' Johnson said he was blessed. He said it more than once, and then remarked that he was on, and added that he must be off that instant minute. Johnson's cottage lies just out of the town beyond the blacksmith's forge and the children had come to it through the wood. They went back the same way, and then down through the town, and through its narrow, unsavoury streets to the towing-path by the timber yard. Here they ran along the trunks of the big trees, peeped into the saw-pit, and the men were away at dinner and this was a favourite play place of every boy within miles made themselves a see-saw with a fresh cut, sweet-smelling pine plank and an elm-root. 'What a ripping place!' said Mabel, breathless on the seesaw's end. 'I believe I like this better than pretending games or even magic.' 'So do I,' said Jimmy. 'Jerry, don't keep sniffing so  you'll have no nose left.' 'I can't help it,' Gerald answered; 'I daren't use my hankey for fear Johnson's on the lookout somewhere unseen. I wish I'd thought of some other signal.' Sniff! 'No, nor I shouldn't want to now if I hadn't got not to. That's what's so rum. The moment I got down here and remembered what I'd said about the signal I began to have a cold and Thank goodness! here he is.' The children, with a fine air of unconcern, abandoned the see-saw. 'Follow my leader!' Gerald cried, and ran along a barked oak trunk, the others following. In and out and round about ran the file of children, over heaps of logs, under the jutting ends of piled planks, and just as the policeman's heavy boots trod the towing-path Gerald halted at the end of a little landing-stage of rotten boards, with a rickety handrail, cried 'Pax!' and blew his nose with loud fervour. 'Morning,' he said immediately. 'Morning,' said Johnson. 'Got a cold, ain't you?' 'Ah! I shouldn't have a cold if I'd got boots like yours,' returned Gerald admiringly. 'Look at them. Anyone ud know your fairy footstep a mile off. How do you ever get near enough to anyone to arrest them?' He skipped off the landing-stage, whispered as he passed Johnson, 'Courage, promptitude, and dispatch. That's the place,' and was off again, the active leader of an active procession. 'We've brought a friend home to dinner,' said Kathleen, when Eliza opened the door. 'Where's Mademoiselle?' 'Gone to see Yalding Towers. Today's show day, you know. An just you hurry over your dinners. It's my afternoon out, and my gentleman friend don't like it if he's kept waiting.' 'All right, we'll eat like lightning,' Gerald promised. 'Set another place, there's an angel.' They kept their word. The dinner it was minced veal and potatoes and rice-pudding, perhaps the dullest food in the world was over in a quarter of an hour. 'And now,' said Mabel, when Eliza and a jug of hot water had disappeared up the stairs together, 'where's the ring? I ought to put it back.' 'I haven't had a turn yet,' said Jimmy. 'When we find it Cathy and I ought to have turns same as you and Gerald did.' 'When you find it ?' Mabel's pale face turned paler between her dark locks. 'I'm very sorry we're all very sorry,' began Kathleen, and then the story of the losing had to be told. 'You couldn't have looked properly,' Mabel protested. 'It can't have vanished.' 'You don't know what it can do no more do we. It's no use getting your quills up, fair lady. Perhaps vanishing itself is just what it does do. You see, it came off my hand in the bed. We looked everywhere.' 'Would you mind if I looked?' Mabel's eyes implored her little hostess. 'You see, if it's lost it's my fault. It's almost the same as stealing. That Johnson would say it was just the same. I know he would.' 'Let's all look again,' said Cathy, jumping up. 'We were rather in a hurry this morning.' So they looked, and they looked. In the bed, under the bed, under the carpet, under the furniture. They shook the curtains, they explored the corners, and found dust and flue, but no ring. They looked, and they looked. Everywhere they looked. Jimmy even looked fixedly at the ceiling, as though he thought the ring might have bounced up there and stuck. But it hadn't. 'Then,' said Mabel at last, 'your housemaid must have stolen it. That's all. I shall tell her I think so.' And she would have done it too, but at that moment the front door banged and they knew that Eliza had gone forth in all the glory of her best things to meet her 'gentleman friend' . 'It's no use,' Mabel was almost in tears; 'look here will you leave me alone? Perhaps you others looking distracts me. And I'll go over every inch of the room by myself.' 'Respecting the emotion of their guest, the kindly charcoal-burners withdrew,' said Gerald. And they closed the door softly from the outside on Mabel and her search. They waited for hers of course politeness demanded it, and besides, they had to stay at home to let Mademoiselle in; though it was a dazzling day, and Jimmy had just remembered that Gerald's pockets were full of the money earned at the fair, and that nothing had yet been bought with that money, except a few buns in which he had had no share. And of course they waited impatiently. It seemed about an hour, and was really quite ten minutes, before they heard the bedroom door open and Mabel's feet on the stairs. 'She hasn't found it,' Gerald said. 'How do you know?' Jimmy asked. 'The way she walks,' said Gerald. You can, in fact, almost always tell whether the thing has been found that people have gone to look for by the sound of their feet as they return. Mabel's feet said 'No go' as plain as they could speak. And her face confirmed the cheerless news. A sudden and violent knocking at the back door prevented anyone from having to be polite about how sorry they were, or fanciful about being sure the ring would turn up soon. All the servants except Eliza were away on their holidays, so the children went together to open the door, because, as Gerald said, if it was the baker they could buy a cake from him and eat it for dessert. 'That kind of dinner sort of needs dessert,' he said. But it was not the baker, When they opened the door they saw in the paved court where the pump is, and the dust-bin, and the water-butt, a young man, with his hat very much on one side, his mouth open under his fair bristly mustache, and his eyes as nearly round as human eyes can be. He wore a suit of a bright mustard colour, a blue necktie, and a goldish watch-chain across his waistcoat. His body was thrown back and his right arm stretched out towards the door, and his expression was that of a person who is being dragged somewhere against his will. He looked so strange that Kathleen tried to shut the door in his face, murmuring, 'Escaped insane.' But the door would not close. There was something in the way. 'Leave go of me!' said the young man. 'Ho yus! I'll leave go of you!' It was the voice of Eliza but no Eliza could be seen. 'Who's got hold of you?' asked Kathleen. 'She has, miss,' replied the unhappy stranger. 'Who's she?' asked Kathleen, to gain time, as she afterwards explained, for she now knew well enough that what was keeping the door open was Eliza's unseen foot. 'My fyongsay, miss. At least it sounds like her voice, and it feels like her bones, but something's come over me, miss, an I can't see her.' 'That's what he keeps on saying,' said Eliza's voice. 'E's my gentleman friend; is 'e gone dotty, or is it me?' 'Both, I shouldn't wonder,' said Jimmy. 'Now,' said Eliza, 'you call yourself a man; you look me in the face and say you can't see me.' 'Well I can't,' said the wretched gentleman friend. 'If I'd stolen a ring,' said Gerald, looking at the sky, 'I should go indoors and be quiet, not stand at the back door and make an exhibition of myself.' 'Not much exhibition about her,' whispered Jimmy; 'good old ring!' 'I haven't stolen anything,' said the gentleman friend. 'Here, you leave me be. It's my eyes has gone wrong. Leave go of me, d'ye hear?' Suddenly his hand dropped and he staggered back against the water-butt. Eliza had 'left go' of him. She pushed past the children, shoving them aside with her invisible elbows. Gerald caught her by the arm with one hand, felt for her ear with the other, and whispered, 'You stand still and don't say a word. If you do well, what's to stop me from sending for the police?' Eliza did not know what there was to stop him. So she did as she was told, and stood invisible and silent, save for a sort of blowing, snorting noise peculiar to her when she was out of breath. The mustard-coloured young man had recovered his balance, and stood looking at the children with eyes, if possible, rounder than before. 'What is it?' he gasped feebly. 'What's up? What's it all about?' 'If you don't know, I'm afraid we can't tell you,' said Gerald politely. 'Have I been talking very strange-like?' he asked, taking off his hat and passing his hand over his forehead. 'Very,' said Mabel. 'I hope I haven't said anything that wasn't good manners,' he said anxiously. 'Not at all,' said Kathleen. 'You only said your fiancee had hold of your hand, and that you couldn't see her.' 'No more I can.' 'No more can we,' said Mabel. 'But I couldn't have dreamed it, and then come along here making a penny show of myself like this, could I?' 'You know best,' said Gerald courteously. 'But,' the mustard-coloured victim almost screamed, 'do you mean to tell me...' 'I don't mean to tell you anything,' said Gerald quite truly, 'but I'll give you a bit of advice. You go home and lie down a bit and put a wet rag on your head. You'll be all right tomorrow.' 'But I haven't ' 'I should,' said Mabel; 'the sun's very hot, you know.' 'I feel all right now,' he said, 'but well, I can only say I'm sorry, that's all I can say. I've never been taken like this before, miss. I'm not subject to it don't you think that. But I could have sworn Eliza Ain't she gone out to meet me?' 'Eliza's in-doors,' said Mabel. 'She can't come out to meet anybody today.' 'You won't tell her about me carrying on this way, will you, miss? It might set her against me if she thought I was liable to fits, which I never was from a child.' 'We won't tell Eliza anything about you.' 'And you'll overlook the liberty?' 'Of course. We know you couldn't help it,' said Kathleen. 'You go home and lie down. I'm sure you must need it. Good afternoon.' 'Good afternoon, I'm sure, miss,' he said dreamily. 'All the same I can feel the print of her finger-bones on my hand while I'm saying it. And you won't let it get round to my boss my employer I mean? Fits of all sorts are against a man in any trade.' 'No, no, no, it's all right good-bye,' said everyone. And a silence fell as he went slowly round the water-butt and the green yard-gate shut behind him. The silence was broken by Eliza. 'Give me up!' she said. 'Give me up to break my heart in a prison cell!' There was a sudden splash, and a round wet drop lay on the doorstep. 'Thunder shower,' said Jimmy; but it was a tear from Eliza. 'Give me up,' she went on, 'give me up' splash 'but don't let me be took here in the town where I'm known and respected' splash. 'I'll walk ten miles to be took by a strange police not Johnson as keeps company with my own cousin' splash. 'But I do thank you for one thing. You didn't tell Elf as I'd stolen the ring. And I didn't splash  I only sort of borrowed it, it being my day out, and my gentleman friend such a toff, like you can see for yourselves.' The children had watched, spellbound, the interesting tears that became visible as they rolled off the invisible nose of the miserable Eliza. Now Gerald roused himself, and spoke. 'It's no use your talking,' he said. 'We can't see you!' 'That's what he said,' said Eliza's voice, 'but ' 'You can't see yourself,' Gerald went on. 'Where's your hand?' Eliza, no doubt, tried to see it, and of course failed; for instantly, with a shriek that might have brought the police if there had been any about, she went into a violent fit of hysterics. The children did what they could, everything that they had read of in books as suitable to such occasions, but it is extremely difficult to do the right thing with an invisible housemaid in strong hysterics and her best clothes. That was why the best hat was found, later on, to be completely ruined, and why the best blue dress was never quite itself again. And as they were burning bits of the feather dusting-brush as nearly under Eliza's nose as they could guess, a sudden spurt of flame and a horrible smell, as the flame died between the quick hands of Gerald, showed but too plainly that Eliza's feather boa had tried to help. It did help. Eliza 'came to' with a deep sob and said, 'Don't burn me real ostrich stole; I'm better now.' They helped her up and she sat down on the bottom step, and the children explained to her very carefully and quite kindly that she really was invisible, and that if you steal or even borrow rings you can never be sure what will happen to you. 'But 'ave I got to go on stopping like this,' she moaned, when they had fetched the little mahogany looking-glass from its nail over the kitchen sink, and convinced her that she was really invisible, 'for ever and ever? An we was to a bin married come Easter. No one won't marry a gell as 'e can't see. It ain't likely.' 'No, not for ever and ever,' said Mabel kindly, 'but you've got to go through with it like measles. I expect you'll be all right tomorrow.' 'Tonight, I think,' said Gerald. 'We'll help you all we can, and not tell anyone,' said Kathleen. 'Not even the police,' said Jimmy. 'Now let's get Mademoiselle's tea ready,' said Gerald. 'And ours,' said Jimmy. 'No,' said Gerald, 'we'll have our tea out. We'll have a picnic and we'll take Eliza. I'll go out and get the cakes.' 'I sha'n't eat no cake, Master Jerry,' said Eliza's voice, 'so don't you think it. You'd see it going down inside my chest. It wouldn't he what I should call nice of me to have cake showing through me in the open air. Oh, it's a dreadful judgment  just for a borrow!' They reassured her, set the tea, deputed Kathleen to let in Mademoiselle who came home tired and a little sad, it seemed waited for her and Gerald and the cakes, and started off for Yalding Towers. 'Picnic parties aren't allowed,' said Mabel. 'Ours will be,' said Gerald briefly. 'Now, Eliza, you catch on to Kathleen's arm and I'll walk behind to conceal your shadow. My aunt! take your hat off; it makes your shadow look like I don't know what. People will think we're the county lunatic asylum turned loose.' It was then that the hat, becoming visible in Kathleen's hand, showed how little of the sprinkled water had gone where it was meant to go on Eliza's face. 'Me best 'at,' said Eliza, and there was a silence with sniffs in it. 'Look here,' said Mabel, 'you cheer up. Just you think this is all a dream. It's just the kind of thing you might dream if your conscience bad got pains in it about the ring.' 'But will I wake up again?' 'Oh yes, you'll wake up again. Now we're going to bandage your eyes and take you through a very small door, and don't you resist, or we'll bring a policeman into the dream like a shot.' I have not time to describe Eliza's entrance into the cave. She went head first: the girls propelled and the boys received her. If Gerald had not thought of tying her hands someone would certainly have been scratched. As it was Mabel's hand was scraped between the cold rock and a passionate boot-heel. Nor will I tell you all that she said as they led her along the fern-bordered gully and through the arch into the wonderland of Italian scenery. She had but little language left when they removed her bandage under a weeping willow where a statue of Diana, bow in hand, stood poised on one toe a most unsuitable attitude for archery, I have always thought. 'Now,' said Gerald, 'it's all over nothing but niceness now and cake and things.' 'It's time we did have our tea,' said Jimmy. And it was. Eliza, once convinced that her chest, though invisible, was not transparent, and that her companions could not by looking through it count how many buns she had eaten, made an excellent meal. So did the others. If you want really to enjoy your tea, have minced veal and potatoes and rice-pudding for dinner, with several hours of excitement to follow, and take your tea late. The soft, cool green and grey of the garden were changing the green grew golden, the shadows black, and the lake where the swans were mirrored upside down, under the Temple of Phoebus, was bathed in rosy light from the little fluffy clouds that lay opposite the Sunset. 'It is pretty,' said Eliza, 'just like a picture-postcard, ain't it? the tuppenny kind.' 'I ought to be getting home,' said Mabel. 'I can't go home like this. I'd stay and be a savage and live in that white hut if it had any walls and doors,' said Eliza. 'She means the Temple of Dionysus,' said Mabel, pointing to it. The sun set suddenly behind the line of black fir-trees on the top of the slope, and the white temple, that had been pink, turned grey. 'It would be a very nice place to live in even as it is,' said Kathleen. 'Draughty,' said Eliza, 'and law, what a lot of steps to clean! What they make houses for without no walls to 'em? Who'd live in,' She broke off, stared, and added: 'What's that?' 'What?' 'That white thing coming down the steps. Why, it's a young man in statooary.' 'The statues do come alive here, after sunset,' said Gerald in very matter-of-fact tones. 'I see they do.' Eliza did not seem at all surprised or alarmed. 'There's another of 'em. Look at them little wings to his feet like pigeons.' 'I expect that's Mercury,' said Gerald. 'It's 'Hermes' under the statue that's got wings on its feet, said Mabel, 'but ' '1 don't see any statues,' said Jimmy. 'What are you punching me for?' 'Don't you see?' Gerald whispered; but he need not have been so troubled, for all Eliza's attention was with her wandering eyes that followed hither and thither the quick movements of unseen statues. 'Don't you see? The statues come alive when the sun goes down and you can't see them unless you're invisible and I if you do see them you're not frightened unless you touch them.' 'Let's get her to touch one and see,' said Jimmy. 'E's lep into the water,' said Eliza in a rapt voice. 'My, can't he swim neither! And the one with the pigeons wings is flying all over the lake having larks with 'im. I do call that pretty. It's like cupids as you see on wedding-cakes. And here's another of 'em, a little chap with long ears and a baby deer galloping alongside! An look at the lady with the biby, throwing it up and catching it like as if it was a ball. I wonder she ain't afraid. But it's pretty to see 'em.' The broad park lay stretched before the children in growing greyness and a stillness that deepened. Amid the thickening shadows they could see the statues gleam white and motionless. But Eliza saw other things. She watched in silence presently, and they watched silently, and the evening fell like a veil that grew heavier and blacker. And it was night. And the moon came up above the trees. 'Oh,' cried Eliza suddenly, 'here's the dear little boy with the deer he's coming right for me, bless his heart!' Next moment she was screaming, and her screams grew fainter and there was the sound of swift boots on gravel. 'Come on!' cried Gerald; 'she touched it, and then she was frightened, Just like I was. Run! she'll send everyone in the town mad if she gets there like that. Just a voice and boots! Run! Run! They ran. But Eliza had the start of them. Also when she ran on the grass they could not hear her footsteps and had to wait for the sound of leather on far-away gravel. Also she was driven by fear, and fear drives fast. She went, it seemed, the nearest way, invisibly through the waxing moonlight, seeing she only knew what amid the glades and groves. 'I'll stop here; see you tomorrow,' gasped Mabel, as the loud pursuers followed Eliza's clatter across the terrace. 'She's gone through the stable yard.' 'The back way,' Gerald panted as they turned the corner of their own street, and he and Jimmy swung in past the water-butt. An unseen but agitated presence seemed to be fumbling with the locked back-door. The church clock struck the half-hour. 'Half-past nine,' Gerald had just breath to say. 'Pull at the ring. Perhaps it'll come off now.' He spoke to the bare doorstep. But it was Eliza, dishevelled, breathless, her hair coming down, her collar crooked, her dress twisted and disordered, who suddenly held out a hand a hand that they could see; and in the hand, plainly visible in the moonlight, the dark circle of the magic ring. 'Alf a mo!' said Eliza's gentleman friend next morning. He was waiting for her when she opened the door with pail and hearthstone in her hand. 'Sorry you couldn't come out yesterday.' 'So'm I.' Eliza swept the wet flannel along the top step. 'What did you do?' 'I 'ad a bit of a headache,' said the gentleman friend. 'I laid down most of the afternoon. What were you up to?' 'Oh, nothing pertickler,' said Eliza. 'Then it was all a dream, she said, when he was gone; 'but it'll be a lesson to me not to meddle with anybody's old ring again in a hurry.' 'So they didn't tell 'er about me behaving like I did,' said he as he went 'sun, I suppose like our Army in India. I hope I ain't going to be liable to it, that's all!' Johnson was the hero of the hour. It was he who had tracked the burglars, laid his plans, and recovered the lost silver. He had not thrown the stone public opinion decided that Mabel and her aunt must have been mistaken in supposing that there was a stone at all. But he did not deny the warning letter. It was Gerald who went out after breakfast to buy the newspaper, and who read aloud to the others the two columns of fiction which were the Liddlesby Observer's report of the facts. As he read every mouth opened wider and wider, and when he ceased with 'this gifted fellow-townsman with detective instincts which out-rival those of Messrs. Lecoq and Holmes, and whose promotion is now assured,' there was quite a blank silence. 'Well,' said Jimmy, breaking it, 'he doesn't stick it on neither, does he?' 'I feel,' said Kathleen, 'as if it was our fault as if it was us had told all these whoppers; because if it hadn't been for you they couldn't have, Jerry. How could he say all that?' 'Well,' said Gerald, trying to be fair, 'you know, after all, the chap had to say something. I'm glad I ' He stopped abruptly. 'You're glad you what?' 'No matter,' said he, with an air of putting away affairs of state. 'Now, what are we going to do today? The faithful Mabel approaches; she will want her ring. And you and Jimmy want it too. Oh, I know. Mademoiselle hasn't had any attention paid to her for more days than our hero likes to confess.' 'I wish you wouldn't always call yourself 'our hero', said Jimmy; 'you aren't mine, anyhow.' 'You're both of you mine,' said Kathleen hastily. 'Good little girl.' Gerald smiled annoyingly. 'Keep baby brother in a good temper till Nursie comes back.' 'You're not going out without us?' Kathleen asked in haste. 'I haste away, 'Tis market day,' sang Gerald, 'And in the market there Buy roses for my fair. If you want to come too, get your boots on, and look slippy about it.' 'I don't want to come,' said Jimmy, and sniffed. Kathleen turned a despairing look on Gerald. 'Oh, James, James,' said Gerald sadly, 'how difficult you make it for me to forget that you're my little brother! If ever I treat you like one of the other chaps, and rot you like I should Turner or Moberley or any of my pals well, this is what comes of it.' 'You don't call them your baby brothers,' said Jimmy, and truly. 'No; and I'll take precious good care I don't call you it again. Come on, my hero and heroine. The devoted Mesrour is your salaaming slave.' The three met Mabel opportunely at the corner of the square where every Friday the stalls and the awnings and the green umbrellas were pitched, and poultry, pork, pottery, vegetables, drapery, sweets, toys, tools, mirrors, and all sorts of other interesting merchandise were spread out on trestle tables, piled on carts whose horses were stabled and whose shafts were held in place by piled wooden cases, or laid out, as in the case of crockery and hardware, on the bare flag-stones of the market-place. The sun was shining with great goodwill, and, as Mabel remarked, 'all Nature looked smiling and gay.' There were a few bunches of flowers among the vegetables, and the children hesitated, balanced in choice. 'Mignonette is sweet,' said Mabel. 'Roses are roses,' said Kathleen. 'Carnations are tuppence,' said Jimmy; and Gerald, sniffing among the bunches of tightly-tied tea-roses, agreed that this settled it. So the carnations were bought, a bunch of yellow ones, like sulphur, a bunch of white ones like clotted cream, and a bunch of red ones like the cheeks of the doll that Kathleen never played with. They took the carnations home, and Kathleen's green hair-ribbon came in beautifully for tying them up, which was hastily done on the doorstep. Then discreetly Gerald knocked at the door of the drawing-room, where Mademoiselle seemed to sit all day. 'Entrez!' came her voice; and Gerald entered. She was not reading, as usual, but bent over a sketch-book; on the table was an open colour-box of un-English appearance, and a box of that slate-coloured liquid so familiar alike to the greatest artist in watercolours and to the humblest child with a sixpenny paintbox. 'With all of our loves,' said Gerald, laying the flowers down suddenly before her. 'But it is that you are a dear child. For this it must that I embrace you no?' And before Gerald could explain that he was too old, she kissed him with little quick French pecks on the two cheeks. 'Are you painting?' he asked hurriedly, to hide his annoyance at being treated like a baby. 'I achieve a sketch of yesterday,' she answered; and before he had time to wonder what yesterday would look like in a picture she showed him a beautiful and exact sketch of Yalding Towers. 'Oh, I say ripping!' was the critic's comment. 'I say, mayn't the others come and see?' The others came, including Mabel, who stood awkwardly behind the rest, and looked over Jimmy's shoulder. 'I say, you are clever,' said Gerald respectfully. 'To what good to have the talent, when one must pass one's life at teaching the infants?' said Mademoiselle. 'It must be fairly beastly,' Gerald owned. 'You, too, see the design?' Mademoiselle asked Mabel, adding: 'A friend from the town, yes?' 'How do you do?' said Mabel politely. 'No, I'm not from the town. I live at Yalding Towers.' The name seemed to impress Mademoiselle very much. Gerald anxiously hoped in his own mind that she was not a snob. 'Yalding Towers,' she repeated, 'but this is very extraordinary. Is it possible that you are then of the family of Lord Yalding?' 'He hasn't any family,' said Mabel; 'he's not married.' 'I would say are you how you say? cousin sister  niece?' 'No,' said Mabel, flushing hotly, 'I'm nothing grand at all. I'm Lord Yalding's housekeeper's niece.' 'But you know Lord Yalding, is it not?' 'No,' said Mabel, 'I've never seen him.' 'He comes then never to his chateau?' 'Not since I've lived there. But he's coming next week.' 'Why lives he not there?' Mademoiselle asked. 'Auntie says he's too poor,' said Mabel, and proceeded to tell the tale as she had heard it in the housekeeper's room: how Lord Yalding's uncle had left all the money he could leave away from Lord Yalding to Lord Yalding's second cousin, and poor Lord Yalding had only just enough to keep the old place in repair, and to live very quietly indeed somewhere else, but not enough to keep the house open or to live there; and how he couldn't sell the house because it was 'in tale . 'What is it then in tail?' asked Mademoiselle. 'In a tale that the lawyers write out,' said Mabel, proud of her knowledge and flattered by the deep interest of the French governess; 'and when once they've put your house in one of their tales you can't sell it or give it away, but you have to leave it to your son, even if you don't want to.' 'But how his uncle could he be so cruel to leave him the chateau and no money?' Mademoiselle asked; and Kathleen and Jimmy stood amazed at the sudden keenness of her interest in what seemed to them the dullest story. 'Oh, I can tell you that too,' said Mabel. 'Lord Yalding wanted to marry a lady his uncle didn't want him to, a barmaid or a ballet lady or something, and he wouldn't give her up, and his uncle said, 'Well then,' and left everything to the cousin.' 'And you say he is not married.' 'No the lady went into a convent; I expect she's bricked-up alive by now.' 'Bricked ?' 'In a wall, you know,: said Mabel, pointing explainingly at the pink and gilt roses of the wall-paper, 'shut up to kill them. That's what they do to you in convents.' 'Not at all,' said Mademoiselle; 'in convents are very kind good women; there is but one thing in convents that is detestable the locks on the doors. Sometimes people cannot get out, especially when they are very young and their relations have placed them there for their welfare and happiness. But brick how you say it? enwalling ladies to kill them. No it does itself never. And this lord he did not then seek his lady?' 'Oh, yes he sought her right enough,' Mabel assured her; 'but there are millions of convents, you know, and he had no idea where to look, and they sent back his letters from the post-office, and ' 'Ciel!' cried Mademoiselle, 'but it seems that one knows all in the housekeeper's saloon.' 'Pretty well all,' said Mabel simply. 'And you think he will find her? No?' 'Oh, he'll find her all right,' said Mabel, 'when he's old and broken down, you know and dying; and then a gentle Sister of Charity will soothe his pillow, and just when he's dying she'll reveal herself and say: 'My own lost love!' and his face will light up with a wonderful joy and he'll expire with her beloved name on his parched lips.' Mademoiselle's was the silence of sheer astonishment. 'You do the prophecy, it appears?' she said at last. 'Oh no,' said Mabel; 'I got that out of a book. I can tell you lots more fatal love-stories any time you like.' The French governess gave a little jump, as though she had suddenly remembered something. 'It is nearly dinner-time,' she said. 'Your friend Mabelle, yes will be your convivial, and in her honour we will make a little feast. My beautiful flowers  put them to the water, Kathleen. I run to buy the cakes. Wash the hands, all, and be ready when I return.' Smiling and nodding to the children, she left them, and ran up the stairs. 'Just as if she was young,' said Kathleen. 'She is young,' said Mabel. 'Heaps of ladies have offers of marriage when they re no younger than her. I've seen lots of weddings too, with much older brides. And why didn't you tell me she was so beautiful?' 'Is she?' asked Kathleen. 'Of course she is; and what a darling to think of cakes for me, and calling me a convivial!' 'Look here,' said Gerald, 'I call this jolly decent of her. You know, governesses never have more than the meanest pittance, just enough to sustain life, and here she is spending her little all on us. Supposing we just don't go out today, but play with her instead. I expect she's most awfully bored really.' 'Would she really like it?' Kathleen wondered. 'Aunt Emily says grown-ups never really like playing. They do it to please us. 'They little know,' Gerald answered, 'how often we do it to please them.' 'We've got to do that dressing-up with the Princess clothes anyhow we said we would,' said Kathleen. 'Let's treat her to that.' 'Rather near tea-time,' urged Jimmy, 'so that there'll be a fortunate interruption and the play won't go on for ever.' 'I suppose all the things are safe?' Mabel asked. 'Quite. I told you where I put them. Come on, Jimmy; let's help lay the table. We'll get Eliza to put out the best china.' They went. 'It was lucky,' said Gerald, struck by a sudden thought, 'that the burglars didn't go for the diamonds in the treasure-chamber.' 'They couldn't,' said Mabel almost in a whisper; 'they didn't know about them. I don't believe anybody knows about them, except me and you, and you're sworn to secrecy. This, you will remember, had been done almost at the beginning. I know aunt doesn't know. I just found out the spring by accident. Lord Yalding's kept the secret well.' 'I wish I'd got a secret like that to keep,' said Gerald. 'If the burglars do know,' said Mabel, 'it'll all come out at the trial. Lawyers make you tell everything you know at trials, and a lot of lies besides.' 'There won't be any trial,' said Gerald, kicking the leg of the piano thoughtfully. 'No trial?' 'It said in the paper,' Gerald went on slowly, ''The miscreants must have received warning from a confederate, for the admirable preparations to arrest them as they returned for their ill-gotten plunder were unavailing. But the police have a clew.'' 'What a pity!' said Mabel. 'You needn't worry they haven't got any old clew,' said Gerald, still attentive to the piano leg. 'I didn't mean the clew; I meant the confederate.' 'It's a pity you think he's a pity, because he was me,' said Gerald, standing up and leaving the piano leg alone. He looked straight before him, as the boy on the burning deck may have looked. 'I couldn't help it,' he said. 'I know you'll think I'm a criminal, but I couldn't do it. I don't know how detectives can. I went over a prison once, with father; and after I'd given the tip to Johnson I remembered that, and I just couldn't. I know I'm a beast, and not worthy to be a British citizen.' 'I think it was rather nice of you,' said Mabel kindly. 'How did you warn them?' 'I just shoved a paper under the man's door the one that I knew where he lived to tell him to lie low.' 'Oh! do tell me what did you put on it exactly?' Mabel warmed to this new interest. 'It said: 'The police know all except your names. Be virtuous and you are safe. But if there's any more burgling I shall split and you may rely on that from a friend.' I know it was wrong, but I couldn't help it. Don't tell the others. They wouldn't understand why I did it. I don't understand it myself.' 'I do, said Mabel: it's because you've got a kind and noble heart.' 'Kind fiddlestick, my good child!' said Gerald, suddenly losing the burning boy expression and becoming in a flash entirely himself. 'Cut along and wash your hands; you're as black as ink.' 'So are you,' said Mabel, 'and I'm not. It's dye with me. Auntie was dyeing a blouse this morning. It told you how in Home Drivel and she's as black as ink too, and the blouse is all streaky. Pity the ring won't make just parts of you invisible the dirt, for instance.' 'Perhaps,' Gerald said unexpectedly, 'it won't make even all of you invisible again.' 'Why not? You haven't been doing anything to it have you?' Mabel sharply asked. 'No; but didn't you notice you were invisible twenty-one hours; I was fourteen hours invisible, and Eliza only seven that's seven less each time. And now we've come to ' 'How frightfully good you are at sums!' said Mabel, awe-struck. 'You see, it's got seven hours less each time, and seven from seven is nought; it's got to be something different this time. And then afterwards it can't be minus seven, because I don't see how  unless it made you more visible thicker, you know.' 'Don't!' said Mabel; 'you make my head go round.' 'And there's another odd thing,' Gerald went on; 'when you're invisible your relations don't love you. Look at your aunt, and Cathy never turning a hair at me going burgling. We haven't got to the bottom of that ring yet. Crikey! here's Mademoiselle with the cakes. Run, bold bandits wash for your lives!' They ran It was not cakes only; it was plums and grapes and jam tarts and soda-water and raspberry vinegar, and chocolates in pretty boxes and pure, thick, rich cream in brown jugs, also a big bunch of roses. Mademoiselle was strangely merry for a governess. She served out the cakes and tarts with a liberal hand, made wreaths of the flowers for all their heads she was not eating much herself drank the health of Mabel, as the guest of the day, in the beautiful pink drink that comes from mixing raspberry vinegar and soda-water, and actually persuaded Jimmy to wear his wreath, on the ground that the Greek gods as well as the goddesses always wore wreaths at a feast. There never was such a feast provided by any French governess since French governesses began. There were jokes and stories and laughter. Jimmy showed all those tricks with forks and corks and matches and apples which are so deservedly popular. Mademoiselle told them stories of her own schooldays when she was 'a quite little girl with two tight tresses  so', and when they could not understand the tresses, called for paper and pencil and drew the loveliest little picture of herself when she was a child with two short fat pig-tails sticking out from her head like knitting-needles from a ball of dark worsted. Then she drew pictures of everything they asked for, till Mabel pulled Gerald's jacket and whispered: 'The acting!' 'Draw us the front of a theatre,' said Gerald tactfully 'a French theatre.' 'They are the same thing as the English theatres,' Mademoiselle told him. 'Do you like acting the theatre, I mean?' 'But yes I love it.' 'All right,' said Gerald briefly. 'We'll act a play for you now this afternoon if you like.' 'Eliza will be washing up,' Cathy whispered, 'and she was promised to see it.' 'Or this evening,' said Gerald 'and please, Mademoiselle, may Eliza come in and look on?' 'But certainly,' said Mademoiselle; 'amuse yourselves well, my children.' 'But it's you,' said Mabel suddenly, 'that we want to amuse. Because we love you very much don't we, all of you?' 'Yes,' the chorus came unhesitatingly. Though the others would never have thought of saying such a thing on their own account. Yet, as Mabel said it, they found to their surprise that it was true. 'Tiens!' said Mademoiselle, 'you love the old French governess? Impossible,' and she spoke rather indistinctly. 'You're not old,' said Mabel; 'at least not so very, she added brightly, and you're as lovely as a Princess.' 'Go then, flatteress!' said Mademoiselle, laughing; and Mabel went. The others were already half-way up the stairs. Mademoiselle sat in the drawing-room as usual, and it was a good thing that she was not engaged in serious study, for it seemed that the door opened and shut almost ceaselessly all throughout the afternoon. Might they have the embroidered antimacassars and the sofa cushions? Might they have the clothes-line out of the washhouse? Eliza said they mightn't, but might they? Might they have the sheepskin hearth-rugs? Might they have tea in the garden, because they had almost got the stage ready in the dining-room, and Eliza wanted to set tea? Could Mademoiselle lend them any coloured clothes scarves or dressing-gowns, or anything bright? Yes, Mademoiselle could, and did silk things, surprisingly lovely for a governess to have. Had Mademoiselle any rouge? They had always heard that French ladies No. Mademoiselle hadn't and to judge by the colour of her face, Mademoiselle didn't need it. Did Mademoiselle think the chemist sold rouge or had she any false hair to spare? At this challenge Mademoiselle's pale fingers pulled out a dozen hairpins, and down came the loveliest blue-black hair, hanging to her knees in straight, heavy lines. 'No, you terrible infants,' she cried. 'I have not the false hair, nor the rouge. And my teeth you want them also, without doubt?' She showed them in a laugh. 'I said you were a Princess,' said Mabel, 'and now I know. You're Rapunzel. Do always wear your hair like that! May we have the peacock fans, please, off the mantelpiece, and the things that loop back the curtains, and all the handkerchiefs you've got?' Mademoiselle denied them nothing. They had the fans and the handkerchiefs and some large sheets of expensive drawing-paper out of the school cupboard, and Mademoiselle's best sable paint-brush and her paint-box. 'Who would have thought,' murmured Gerald, pensively sucking the brush and gazing at the paper mask he had just painted, 'that she was such a brick in disguise? I wonder why crimson lake always tastes just like Liebig's Extract.' Everything was pleasant that day somehow. There are some days like that, you know, when everything goes well from the very beginning; all the things you want are in their places, nobody misunderstands you, and all that you do turns out admirably. How different from those other days which we all know too well, when your shoe-lace breaks, your comb is mislaid, your brush spins on its back on the floor and lands under the bed where you can't get at it you drop the soap, your buttons come off, an eyelash gets into your eye, you have used your last clean handkerchief, your collar is frayed at the edge and cuts your neck, and at the very last moment your suspender breaks, and there is no string. On such a day as this you are naturally late for breakfast, and everyone thinks you did it on purpose. And the day goes on and on, getting worse and worse you mislay your exercise-book, you drop your arithmetic in the mud, your pencil breaks, and when you open your knife to sharpen the pencil you split your nail. On such a day you jam your thumb in doors, and muddle the messages you are sent on by grown-ups. You upset your tea, and your bread-and-butter won't hold together for a moment. And when at last you get to bed usually in disgrace it is no comfort at all to you to know that not a single bit of it is your own fault. This day was not one of those days, as you will have noticed. Even the tea in the garden there was a bricked bit by a rockery that made a steady floor for the tea-table was most delightful, though the thoughts of four out of the five were busy with the coming play, and the fifth had thoughts of her own that had had nothing to do with tea or acting. Then there was an interval of slamming doors, interesting silences, feet that flew up and down stairs. It was still good daylight when the dinner-bell rang  the signal had been agreed upon at tea-time, and carefully explained to Eliza. Mademoiselle laid down her book and passed out of the sunset-yellowed hail into the faint yellow gaslight of the dining-room. The giggling Eliza held the door open before her, and followed her in. The shutters had been closed streaks of daylight showed above and below them. The green-and-black tablecloths of the school dining-tables were supported on the clothes-line from the backyard. The line sagged in a graceful curve, but it answered its purpose of supporting the curtains which concealed that part of the room which was the stage. Rows of chairs had been placed across the other end of the room all the chairs in the house, as it seemed and Mademoiselle started violently when she saw that fully half a dozen of these chairs were occupied. And by the queerest people, too an old woman with a poke bonnet tied under her chin with a red handkerchief, a lady in a large straw hat wreathed in flowers and the oddest hands that stuck out over the chair in front of her, several men with strange, clumsy figures, and all with hats on. 'But,' whispered Mademoiselle, through the chinks of the tablecloths, 'you have then invited other friends? You should have asked me, my children.' Laughter and something like a 'hurrah' answered her from behind the folds of the curtaining tablecloths. 'All right, Mademoiselle Rapunzel,' cried Mabel; 'turn the gas up. It's only part of the entertainment.' Eliza, still giggling, pushed through the lines of chairs, knocking off the hat of one of the visitors as she did so, and turned up the three incandescent burners. Mademoiselle looked at the figure seated nearest to her, stooped to look more closely, half laughed, quite screamed, and sat down suddenly. 'Oh!' she cried, 'they are not alive!' Eliza, with a much louder scream, had found out the same thing and announced it differently. 'They ain't got no insides,' said she. The seven members of the audience seated among the wilderness of chairs had, indeed, no insides to speak of. Their bodies were bolsters and rolled-up blankets, their spines were broom-handles, and their arm and leg bones were hockey sticks and umbrellas. Their shoulders were the wooden crosspieces that Mademoiselle used for keeping her jackets in shape; their hands were gloves stuffed out with handkerchiefs; and their faces were the paper masks painted in the afternoon by the untutored brush of Gerald, tied on to the round heads made of the ends of stuffed bolster-cases. The faces were really rather dreadful. Gerald had done his best, but even after his best had been done you would hardly have known they were faces, some of them, if they hadn't been in the positions which faces usually occupy, between the collar and the hat. Their eyebrows were furious with lamp-black frowns their eyes the size, and almost the shape, of five-shilling pieces, and on their lips and cheeks had been spent much crimson lake and nearly the whole of a half-pan of vermilion. 'You have made yourself an auditors, yes? Bravo!' cried Mademoiselle, recovering herself and beginning to clap. And to the sound of that clapping the curtain went up or, rather, apart. A voice said, in a breathless, choked way, 'Beauty and the Beast,' and the stage was revealed. It was a real stage too the dining-tables pushed close together and covered with pink-and-white counterpanes. It was a little unsteady and creaky to walk on, but very imposing to look at. The scene was simple, but convincing. A big sheet of cardboard, bent square, with slits cut in it and a candle behind, represented, quite transparently, the domestic hearth; a round hat-tin of Eliza s, supported on a stool with a night-light under it, could not have been mistaken, save by wilful malice, for anything but a copper. A waste-paper basket with two or three school dusters and an overcoat in it, and a pair of blue pyjamas over the back of a chair, put the finishing touch to the scene. It did not need the announcement from the wings, 'The laundry at Beauty's home.' It was so plainly a laundry and nothing else. In the wings: 'They look just like a real audience, don't they?' whispered Mabel. 'Go on, Jimmy don't forget the Merchant has to be pompous and use long words.' Jimmy, enlarged by pillows under Gerald's best overcoat which had been intentionally bought with a view to his probable growth during the two years which it was intended to last him, a Turkish towel turban on his head and an open umbrella over it, opened the first act in a simple and swift soliloquy: 'I am the most unlucky merchant that ever was. I was once the richest merchant in Bagdad, but I lost all my ships, and now I live in a poor house that is all to bits; you can see how the rain comes through the roof, and my daughters take in washing. And ,' The pause might have seemed long, but Gerald rustled in, elegant in Mademoiselle's pink dressing-gown and the character of the eldest daughter. 'A nice drying day,' he minced. 'Pa dear, put the umbrella the other way up. It'll save us going out in the rain to fetch water. Come on, sisters, dear father's got us a new wash-tub. Here's luxury!' Round the umbrella, now held the wrong way up, the three sisters knelt and washed imaginary linen. Kathleen wore a violet skirt of Eliza s, a blue blouse of her own, and a cap of knotted handkerchiefs. A white nightdress girt with a white apron and two red carnations in Mabel's black hair left no doubt as to which of the three was Beauty. The scene went very well. The final dance with waving towels was all that there is of charming, Mademoiselle said; and Eliza was so much amused that, as she said, she got quite a nasty stitch along of laughing so hearty. You know pretty well what Beauty and the Beast would be like acted by four children who had spent the afternoon in arranging their costumes and so had left no time for rehearsing what they had to say. Yet it delighted them, and it charmed their audience. And what more can any play do, even Shakespeare's? Mabel, in her Princess clothes, was a resplendent Beauty; and Gerald a Beast who wore the drawing-room hearthrugs with an air of indescribable distinction. If Jimmy was not a talkative merchant, he made it up with a stoutness practically unlimited, and Kathleen surprised and delighted even herself by the quickness with which she changed from one to the other of the minor characters fairies, servants, and messengers. It was at the end of the second act that Mabel, whose costume, having reached the height of elegance, could not be bettered and therefore did not need to be changed, said to Gerald, sweltering under the weighty magnificence of his beast-skin: 'I say, you might let us have the ring back.' 'I'm going to,' said Gerald, who had quite forgotten it. 'I'll give it you in the next scene. Only don't lose it, or go putting it on. You might go out all together and never be seen again, or you might get seven times as visible as anyone else, so that all the rest of us would look like shadows beside you, you'd be so thick, or ,' 'Ready!' said Kathleen, bustling in, once more a wicked sister. Gerald managed to get his hand into his pocket under his hearthrug, and when he rolled his eyes in agonies of sentiment, and said, 'Farewell, dear Beauty! Return quickly, for if you remain long absent from your faithful beast he will assuredly perish,' he pressed a ring into her hand and added: 'This is a magic ring that will give you anything you wish. When you desire to return to your own disinterested beast, put on the ring and utter your wish. Instantly you will be by my side.' Beauty-Mabel took the ring, and it was the ring. The curtains closed to warm applause from two pairs of hands. The next scene went splendidly. The sisters were almost too natural in their disagreeableness, and Beauty's annoyance when they splashed her Princess's dress with real soap and water was considered a miracle of good acting. Even the merchant rose to something more than mere pillows, and the curtain fell on his pathetic assurance that in the absence of his dear Beauty he was wasting away to a shadow. And again two pairs of hands applauded. 'Here, Mabel, catch hold,' Gerald appealed from under the weight of a towel-horse, the tea-urn, the tea-tray, and the green baize apron of the boot boy, which together with four red geraniums from the landing, the pampas-grass from the drawing-room fireplace, and the india-rubber plants from the drawing-room window were to represent the fountains and garden of the last act. The applause had died away. 'I wish,' said Mabel, taking on herself the weight of the tea-urn, 'I wish those creatures we made were alive. We should get something like applause then.' 'I'm jolly glad they aren't, said Gerald, arranging the baize and the towel-horse. 'Brutes! It makes me feel quite silly when I catch their paper eyes.' The curtains were drawn back. There lay the hearthrug-coated beast, in flat abandonment among the tropic beauties of the garden, the pampas-grass shrubbery, the india-rubber plant bushes, the geranium-trees and the urn fountain. Beauty was ready to make her great entry in all the thrilling splendour of despair. And then suddenly it all happened. Mademoiselle began it: she applauded the garden scene with hurried little clappings of her quick French hands. Eliza's fat red palms followed heavily, and then someone else was clapping, six or seven people, and their clapping made a dull padded sound. Nine faces instead of two were turned towards the stage, and seven out of the nine were painted, pointed paper faces. And every hand and every face was alive. The applause grew louder as Mabel glided forward, and as she paused and looked at the audience her unstudied pose of horror and amazement drew forth applause louder still; but it was not loud enough to drown the shrieks of Mademoiselle and Eliza as they rushed from the room, knocking chairs over and crushing each other in the doorway. Two distant doors banged, Mademoiselle's door and Eliza's door. 'Curtain! curtain! quick!' cried Beauty-Mabel, in a voice that wasn't Mabel's or the Beauty's. 'Jerry those things have come alive. Oh, whatever shall we do?' Gerald in his hearthrugs leaped to his feet. Again that flat padded applause marked the swish of cloths on clothes-line as Jimmy and Kathleen drew the curtains. 'What's up?' they asked as they drew. 'You've done it this time!' said Gerald to the pink, perspiring Mabel. 'Oh, bother these strings!' 'Can't you burst them? I've done it?' retorted Mabel. 'I like that!' 'More than I do,' said Gerald. 'Oh, it's all right,' said Mabel. 'Come on. We must go and pull the things to pieces then they can't go on being alive.' 'It's your fault, anyhow,' said Gerald with every possible absence of gallantry. 'Don't you see? It's turned into a wishing ring. I knew something different was going to happen. Get my knife out of my pocket this string's in a knot. Jimmy, Cathy, those Ugly-Wuglies have come alive because Mabel wished it. Cut out and pull them to pieces.' Jimmy and Cathy peeped through the curtain and recoiled with white faces and staring eyes. 'Not me!' was the brief rejoinder of Jimmy. Cathy said, 'Not much!' And she meant it, anyone could see that. And now, as Gerald, almost free of the hearthrugs, broke his thumb-nail on the stiffest blade of his knife, a thick rustling and a sharp, heavy stumping sounded beyond the curtain. 'They're going out!' screamed Kathleen 'walking out on their umbrella and broomstick legs. You can't stop them, Jerry, they re too awful!' 'Everybody in the town'll be insane by tomorrow night if we don't stop them,' cried Gerald. 'Here, give me the ring I'll unwish them.' He caught the ring from the unresisting Mabel, cried, 'I wish the Uglies weren't alive,' and tore through the door. He saw, in fancy, Mabel's wish undone, and the empty hall strewed with limp bolsters, hats, umbrellas, coats and gloves, prone abject properties from which the brief life had gone out for ever. But the hall was crowded with live things, strange things all horribly short as broom sticks and umbrellas are short. A limp hand gesticulated. A pointed white face with red cheeks looked up at him, and wide red lips said something, he could not tell what. The voice reminded him of the old beggar down by the bridge who had no roof to his mouth. These creatures had no roofs to their mouths, of course they had no 'Aa 00 re  o me me oo a oo ho el?' said the voice again. And it had said it four times before Gerald could collect himself sufficiently to understand that this horror alive, and most likely quite uncontrollable  was saying, with a dreadful calm, polite persistence: 'Can you recommend me to a good hotel?' 'Can you recommend me to a good hotel?' The speaker had no inside to his head. Gerald had the best of reasons for knowing it. The speaker's coat had no shoulders inside it only the cross-bar that a jacket is slung on by careful ladies. The hand raised in interrogation was not a hand at all; it was a glove lumpily stuffed with pocket-handkerchiefs; and the arm attached to it was only Kathleen's school umbrella. Yet the whole thing was alive, and was asking a definite, and for anybody else, anybody who really was a body, a reasonable question. With a sensation of inward sinking, Gerald realized that now or never was the time for him to rise to the occasion. And at the thought he inwardly sank more deeply than before. It seemed impossible to rise in the very smallest degree. 'I beg your pardon' was absolutely the best he could do; and the painted, pointed paper face turned to him once more, and once more said: 'Aa 00 re  o me me oo a oo ho el?' 'You want a hotel?' Gerald repeated stupidly, 'a good hotel?' 'A oo ho el,' reiterated the painted lips. 'I'm awfully sorry,' Gerald went on one can always be polite, of course, whatever happens, and politeness came natural to him 'but all our hotels shut so early about eight, I think.' 'Och em er,' said the Ugly-Wugly. Gerald even now does not understand how that practical joke hastily wrought of hat, overcoat, paper face and limp hands could have managed, by just being alive, to become perfectly respectable, apparently about fifty years old, and obviously well known and respected in his own suburb the kind of man who travels first class and smokes expensive cigars. Gerald knew this time, without need of repetition, that the Ugly-Wugly had said: 'Knock 'em up.' 'You can't,' Gerald explained; 'they re all stone deaf every single person who keeps a hotel in this town. It's,' he wildly plunged 'it's a County Council law. Only deaf people are allowed to keep hotels. It's because of the hops in the beer,' he found himself adding; 'you know, hops are so good for ear-ache.' 'I 0 wy ollo oo,' said the respectable Ugly-Wugly; and Gerald was not surprised to find that the thing did 'not quite follow him.' 'It is a little difficult at first,' he said. The other Ugly-Wuglies were crowding round. The lady in the poke bonnet said Gerald found he was getting quite clever at understanding the conversation of those who had no roofs to their mouths: 'If not a hotel, a lodging.' 'My lodging is on the cold ground,' sang itself unbidden and unavailing in Gerald's ear. Yet stay was it unavailing? 'I do know a lodging,' he said slowly, 'but ,' The tallest of the Ugly-Wuglies pushed forward. He was dressed in the old brown overcoat and top-hat which always hung on the school hat-stand to discourage possible burglars by deluding them into the idea that there was a gentleman-of-the-house, and that he was at home. He had an air at once more sporting and less reserved than that of the first speaker, and anyone could see that he was not quite a gentleman. 'Wa I wo oo oh,' he began, but the lady Ugly-Wugly in the flower-wreathed hat interrupted him. She spoke more distinctly than the others, owing, as Gerald found afterwards, to the fact that her mouth had been drawn open, and the flap cut from the aperture had been folded back so that she really had something like a roof to her mouth, though it was only a paper one. 'What I want to know,' Gerald understood her to say, 'is where are the carriages we ordered?' 'I don't know,' said Gerald, 'but I'll find out. But we ought to be moving,' he added; 'you see, the performance is over, and they want to shut up the house and put the lights out. Let's be moving.' 'Eh ech e oo-ig,' repeated the respectable Ugly-Wugly, and stepped towards the front door. 'Oo urn oo,' said the flower-wreathed one; and Gerald assures me that her vermilion lips stretched in a smile. 'I shall be delighted,' said Gerald with earnest courtesy, 'to do anything, of course. Things do happen so awkwardly when you least expect it. I could go with you, and get you a lodging, if you'd only wait a few moments in the in the yard. It's quite a superior sort of yard, he went on, as a wave of surprised disdain passed over their white paper faces not a common yard, you know; the pump,' he added madly, 'has just been painted green all over, and the dustbin is enamelled iron.' The Ugly-Wuglies turned to each other in consultation, and Gerald gathered that the greenness of the pump and the enamelled character of the dustbin made, in their opinion, all the difference. 'I'm awfully sorry,' he urged eagerly, 'to have to ask you to wait, but you see I've got an uncle who's quite mad, and I have to give him his gruel at half-past nine. He won't feed out of any hand but mine.' Gerald did not mind what he said. The only people one is allowed to tell lies to are the Ugly-Wuglies; they are all clothes and have no insides, because they are not human beings, but only a sort of very real visions, and therefore cannot be really deceived, though they may seem to be. Through the back door that has the blue, yellow, red, and green glass in it, down the iron steps into the yard, Gerald led the way, and the Ugly-Wuglies trooped after him. Some of them had boots, but the ones whose feet were only broomsticks or umbrellas found the open-work iron stairs very awkward. 'If you wouldn't mind,' said Gerald, 'just waiting under the balcony? My uncle is so very mad. If he were to see see any strangers I mean, even aristocratic ones I couldn't answer for the consequences.' 'Perhaps, said the flower-hatted lady nervously, 'it would be better for us to try and find a lodging ourselves?' 'I wouldn't advise you to,' said Gerald as grimly as he knew how; 'the police here arrest all strangers. It's the new law the Liberals have just made,' he added convincingly, 'and you'd get the sort of lodging you wouldn't care for I couldn't bear to think of you in a prison dungeon,' he added tenderly. 'I ah wi oo er papers,' said the respectable Ugly-Wugly, and added something that sounded like 'disgraceful state of things.' However, they ranged themselves under the iron balcony. Gerald gave one last look at them and wondered, in his secret heart, why he was not frightened, though in his outside mind he was congratulating himself on his bravery. For the things did look rather horrid. In that light it was hard to believe that they were really only clothes and pillows and sticks with no insides. As he went up the steps he heard them talking among themselves in that strange language of theirs, all oo's and ah's; and he thought he distinguished the voice of the respectable Ugly-Wugly saying, 'Most gentlemanly lad,' and the wreathed-hatted lady answering warmly: 'Yes, indeed.' The coloured-glass door closed behind him. Behind him was the yard, peopled by seven impossible creatures. Before him lay the silent house, peopled, as he knew very well, by five human beings as frightened as human beings could be. You think, perhaps, that Ugly-Wuglies are nothing to be frightened of. That's only because you have never seen one come alive. You must make one any old suit of your father s, and a hat that he isn't wearing, a bolster or two, a painted paper face, a few sticks and a pair of boots will do the trick; get your father to lend you a wishing ring, give it back to him when it has done its work, and see how you feel then. Of course the reason why Gerald was not afraid was that he had the ring; and, as you have seen, the wearer of that is not frightened by anything unless he touches that thing. But Gerald knew well enough how the others must be feeling. That was why he stopped for a moment in the hall to try and imagine what would have been most soothing to him if he had been as terrified as he knew they were. 'Cathy! I say! What ho, Jimmy! Mabel ahoy!' he cried in a loud, cheerful voice that sounded very unreal to himself. The dining-room door opened a cautious inch. 'I say such larks!' Gerald went on, shoving gently at the door with his shoulder. 'Look out! what are you keeping the door shut for?' 'Are you alone?' asked Kathleen in hushed, breathless tones. 'Yes, of course. Don't be a duffer!' The door opened, revealing three scared faces and the disarranged chairs where that odd audience had sat. 'Where are they? Have you unwished them? We heard them talking. Horrible!' 'They're in the yard,' said Gerald with the best imitation of joyous excitement that he could manage. 'It is such fun! They're just like real people, quite kind and jolly. It's the most ripping lark. Don't let on to Mademoiselle and Eliza. I'll square them. Then Kathleen and Jimmy must go to bed, and I'll see Mabel home, and as soon as we get outside I must find some sort of lodging for the Ugly-Wuglies they are such fun though. I do wish you could all go with me.' 'Fun?' echoed Kathleen dismally and doubting. 'Perfectly killing,' Gerald asserted resolutely. 'Now, you just listen to what I say to Mademoiselle and Eliza, and back me up for all you're worth. 'But,' said Mabel, 'you can't mean that you're going to leave me alone directly we get out, and go off with those horrible creatures. They look like fiends.' 'You wait till you've seen them close,' Gerald advised. 'Why, they re just ordinary the first thing one of them did was to ask me to recommend it to a good hotel! I couldn't understand it at first, because it has no roof to its mouth, of course.' It was a mistake to say that, Gerald knew it at once. Mabel and Kathleen were holding hands in a way that plainly showed how a few moments ago they had been clinging to each other in an agony of terror. Now they clung again. And Jimmy, who was sitting on the edge of what had been the stage, kicking his boots against the pink counterpane, shuddered visibly. 'It doesn't matter,' Gerald explained 'about the roofs, I mean; you soon get to understand. I heard them say I was a gentlemanly lad as I was coming away. They wouldn't have cared to notice a little thing like that if they'd been fiends, you know.' 'It doesn't matter how gentlemanly they think you; if you don't see me home you aren't, that's all. Are you going to?' Mabel demanded. 'Of course I am. We shall have no end of a lark. Now for Mademoiselle.' He had put on his coat as he spoke and now ran up the stairs. The others, herding in the hall, could hear his light-hearted there s-nothing-unusual-the-matter-whatever-did-you-bolt-like-that-for knock at Mademoiselle's door, the reassuring 'It's only me Gerald, you know,' the pause, the opening of the door, and the low-voiced parley that followed; then Mademoiselle and Gerald at Eliza's door, voices of reassurance; Eliza's terror, bluntly voluble, tactfully soothed. 'Wonder what lies he's telling them,' Jimmy grumbled. 'Oh! not lies,' said Mabel; 'he's only telling them as much of the truth as it's good for them to know.' 'If you'd been a man,' said Jimmy witheringly, 'you'd have been a beastly Jesuit, and hid up chimneys.' 'If I were only just a boy,' Mabel retorted, 'I shouldn't be scared out of my life by a pack of old coats.' 'I'm so sorry you were frightened,' Gerald's honeyed tones floated down the staircase; 'we didn't think about you being frightened. And it was a good trick, wasn't it?' 'There!' whispered Jimmy, 'he's been telling her it was a trick of ours.' 'Well, so it was,' said Mabel stoutly. 'It was indeed a wonderful trick,' said Mademoiselle; 'and how did you move the mannikins?' 'Oh, we've often done it with strings, you know,' Gerald explained. 'That's true, too,' Kathleen whispered. 'Let us see you do once again this trick so remarkable,' said Mademoiselle, arriving at the bottom-stair mat. 'Oh, I've cleared them all out,' said Gerald. ('So he has, from Kathleen aside to Jimmy.) 'We were so sorry you were startled; we thought you wouldn't like to see them again.' 'Then,' said Mademoiselle brightly, as she peeped into the untidy dining-room and saw that the figures had indeed vanished, 'if we supped and discoursed of your beautiful piece of theatre?' Gerald explained fully how much his brother and sister would enjoy this. As for him Mademoiselle would see that it was his duty to escort Mabel home, and kind as it was of Mademoiselle to ask her to stay the night, it could not be, on account of the frenzied and anxious affection of Mabel's aunt. And it was useless to suggest that Eliza should see Mabel home, because Eliza was nervous at night unless accompanied by her gentleman friend. So Mabel was hatted with her own hat and cloaked with a cloak that was not hers; and she and Gerald went out by the front door, amid kind last words and appointments for the morrow. The moment that front door was shut Gerald caught Mabel by the arm and led her briskly to the corner of the side street which led to the yard. Just round the corner he stopped. 'Now,' he said, 'what I want to know is are you an idiot or aren't you?' 'Idiot yourself!' said Mabel, but mechanically, for she saw that he was in earnest. 'Because I'm not frightened of the Ugly-Wuglies. They're as harmless as tame rabbits. But an idiot might be frightened, and give the whole show away. If you're an idiot, say so, and I'll go back and tell them you're afraid to walk home, and that I'll go and let your aunt know you're stopping.' 'I'm not an idiot,' said Mabel; 'and,' she added, glaring round her with the wild gaze of the truly terror-stricken, 'I'm not afraid of anything.' 'I'm going to let you share my difficulties and dangers,' said Gerald; 'at least, I'm inclined to let you. I wouldn't do as much for my own brother, I can tell you. And if you queer my pitch I'll never speak to you again or let the others either.' 'You're a beast, that's what you are! I don't need to be threatened to make me brave. I am.' 'Mabel,' said Gerald, in low, thrilling tones, for he saw that the time had come to sound another note, 'I know you're brave. I believe in you, That's why I've arranged it like this. I'm certain you've got the heart of a lion under that black-and-white exterior. Can I trust you? To the death?' Mabel felt that to say anything but 'Yes' was to throw away a priceless reputation for courage. So 'Yes' was what she said. 'Then wait here. You're close to the lamp. And when you see me coming with them remember they re as harmless as serpents I mean doves. Talk to them just like you would to anyone else. See?' He turned to leave her, but stopped at her natural question: 'What hotel did you say you were going to take them to?' 'Oh, Jimminy!' the harassed Gerald caught at his hair with both hands. 'There! you see, Mabel, you're a help already.' he had, even at that moment, some tact left. 'I clean forgot! I meant to ask you isn't there any lodge or anything in the Castle grounds where I could put them for the night? The charm will break, you know, some time, like being invisible did, and they'll just be a pack of coats and things that we can easily carry home any day. Is there a lodge or anything?' 'There's a secret passage,' Mabel began but at the moment the yard-door opened and an Ugly-Wugly put out its head and looked anxiously down the street. 'Righto!' Gerald ran to meet it. It was all Mabel could do not to run in an opposite direction with an opposite motive. It was all she could do, but she did it, and was proud of herself as long as ever she remembered that night. And now, with all the silent precaution necessitated by the near presence of an extremely insane uncle, the Ugly-Wuglies, a grisly band, trooped out of the yard door. 'Walk on your toes, dear,' the bonneted Ugly-Wugly whispered to the one with a wreath; and even at that thrilling crisis Gerald wondered how she could, since the toes of one foot were but the end of a golf club and of the other the end of a hockey-stick. Mabel felt that there was no shame in retreating to the lamp-post at the street corner, but, once there, she made herself halt and no one but Mabel will ever know how much making that took. Think of it to stand there, firm and quiet, and wait for those hollow, unbelievable things to come up to her, clattering on the pavement with their stumpy feet or borne along noiselessly, as in the case of the flower-hatted lady, by a skirt that touched the ground, and had, Mabel knew very well, nothing at all inside it. She stood very still; the insides of her hands grew cold and damp, but still she stood, saying over and over again: 'They re not true they can't be true. It's only a dream they aren't really true. They can't be.' And then Gerald was there, and all the Ugly-Wuglies crowding round, and Gerald saying: 'This is one of our friends Mabel the Princess in the play, you know. Be a man!' he added in a whisper for her ear alone. Mabel, all her nerves stretched tight as banjo strings, had an awful instant of not knowing whether she would be able to be a man or whether she would be merely a shrieking and running little mad girl. For the respectable Ugly-Wugly shook her limply by the hand. ('He can't be true,' she told herself), and the rose-wreathed one took her arm with a soft-padded glove at the end of an umbrella arm, and said: 'You dear, clever little thing! Do walk with me!' in a gushing, girlish way, and in speech almost wholly lacking in consonants. Then they all walked up the High Street as if, as Gerald said, they were anybody else. It was a strange procession, but Liddlesby goes early to bed, and the Liddlesby police, in common with those of most other places, wear boots that one can hear a mile off. If such boots had been heard, Gerald would have had time to turn back and head them off. He felt now that he could not resist a flush of pride in Mabel's courage as he heard her polite rejoinders to the still more polite remarks of the amiable Ugly-Wuglies. He did not know how near she was to the scream that would throw away the whole thing and bring the police and the residents out to the ruin of everybody. They met no one, except one man, who murmured, 'Guy Fawkes, swelp me!' and crossed the road hurriedly; and when, next day, he told what he had seen, his wife disbelieved him, and also said it was a judgement on him, which was unreasonable. Mabel felt as though she were taking part in a very completely arranged nightmare, but Gerald was in it too Gerald, who had asked if she was an idiot. Well, she wasn't. But she soon would be, she felt. Yet she went on answering the courteous vowel-talk of these impossible people. She had often heard her aunt speak of impossible people. Well, now she knew what they were like. Summer twilight had melted into summer moonlight. The shadows of the Ugly-Wuglies on the white road were much more horrible than their more solid selves. Mabel wished it had been a dark night, and then corrected the wish with a hasty shudder. Gerald, submitting to a searching interrogatory from the tall-hatted Ugly-Wugly as to his schools, his sports, pastimes, and ambitions, wondered how long the spell would last. The ring seemed to work in sevens. Would these things have seven hours'life or fourteen or twenty-one?'His mind lost itself in the intricacies of the seven-times table (a teaser at the best of times) and only found itself with a shock when the procession found itself at the gates of the Castle grounds. Locked of course. 'You see,' he explained, as the Ugly-Wuglies vainly shook the iron gates with incredible hands; 'it's so very late. There is another way. But you have to climb through a hole.' 'The ladies,' the respectable Ugly-Wugly began objecting; but the ladies with one voice affirmed that they loved adventures. 'So frightfully thrilling,' added the one who wore roses. So they went round by the road, and coming to the hole it was a little difficult to find in the moonlight, which always disguises the most familiar things  Gerald went first with the bicycle lantern which he had snatched as his pilgrims came out of the yard; the shrinking Mabel followed, and then the Ugly-Wuglies, with hollow rattlings of their wooden limbs against the stone, crept through, and with strange vowel-sounds of general amazement, manly courage, and feminine nervousness, followed the light along the passage through the fern-hung cutting and under the arch. When they emerged on the moonlit enchantment of the Italian garden a quite intelligible 'Oh!' of surprised admiration broke from more than one painted paper lip; and the respectable Ugly-Wugly was understood to say that it must be quite a show-place by George, sir! yes. Those marble terraces and artfully serpentining gravel walks surely never had echoed to steps so strange. No shadows so wildly unbelievable had, for all its enchantments, ever fallen on those smooth, grey, dewy lawns. Gerald was thinking this, or something like it (what he really thought was, 'I bet there never was such ado as this, even here! ), when he saw the statue of Hermes leap from its pedestal and run towards him and his company with all the lively curiosity of a street boy eager to be in at a street fight. He saw, too, that he was the only one who perceived that white advancing presence. And he knew that it was the ring that let him see what by others could not be seen. He slipped it from his finger. Yes; Hermes was on his pedestal, still as the snow man you make in the Christmas holidays. He put the ring on again, and there was Hermes, circling round the group and gazing deep in each unconscious Ugly-Wugly face. 'This seems a very superior hotel,' the tall-hatted Ugly-Wugly was saying; 'the grounds are laid out with what you might call taste.' 'We should have to go in by the back door,' said Mabel suddenly. 'The front door's locked at half-past nine.' A short, stout Ugly-Wugly in a yellow and blue cricket cap, who had hardly spoken, muttered something about an escapade, and about feeling quite young again. And now they had skirted the marble-edged pool where the goldfish swam and glimmered, and where the great prehistoric beast had come down to bathe and drink. The water flashed white diamonds in the moonlight, and Gerald alone of them all saw that the scaly-plated vast lizard was even now rolling and wallowing there among the lily pads. They hastened up the steps of the Temple of Flora. The back of it, where no elegant arch opened to the air, was against one of those sheer hills, almost cliffs, that diversified the landscape of that garden. Mabel passed behind the statue of the goddess, fumbled a little, and then Gerald's lantern, flashing like a searchlight, showed a very high and very narrow doorway: the stone that was the door, and that had closed it, revolved slowly under the touch of Mabel's fingers. 'This way,' she said, and panted a little. The back of her neck felt cold and goose-fleshy. 'You lead the way, my lad, with the lantern,' said the suburban Ugly-Wugly in his bluff, agreeable way. 'I I must stay behind to close the door,' said Gerald. 'The Princess can do that. We'll help her,' said the wreathed one with effusion; and Gerald thought her horribly officious. He insisted gently that he would be the one responsible for the safe shutting of that door. 'You wouldn't like me to get into trouble, I'm sure,' he urged; and the Ugly-Wuglies, for the last time kind and reasonable, agreed that this, of all things, they would most deplore. 'You take it,' Gerald urged, pressing the bicycle lamp on the elderly Ugly-Wugly; 'you're the natural leader. Go straight ahead. Are there any steps?' he asked Mabel in a whisper. 'Not for ever so long,' she whispered back. 'It goes on for ages, and then twists round.' 'Whispering,' said the smallest Ugly-Wugly suddenly, 'ain't manners.' 'He hasn't any, anyhow,' whispered the lady Ugly-Wugly; 'don't mind him quite a self-made man,' and squeezed Mabel's arm with horrible confidential flabbiness. The respectable Ugly-Wugly leading with the lamp, the others following trustfully, one and all disappeared into that narrow doorway; and Gerald and Mabel standing without, hardly daring to breathe lest a breath should retard the procession, almost sobbed with relief. Prematurely, as it turned out. For suddenly there was a rush and a scuffle inside the passage, and as they strove to close the door the Ugly-Wuglies fiercely pressed to open it again. Whether they saw something in the dark passage that alarmed them, whether they took it into their empty heads that this could not be the back way to any really respectable hotel, or whether a convincing sudden instinct warned them that they were being tricked, Mabel and Gerald never knew. But they knew that the Ugly- Wuglies were no longer friendly and commonplace, that a fierce change had come over them. Cries of 'No, No!' 'We won't go on!' 'Make him lead!' broke the dreamy stillness of the perfect night. There were screams from ladies voices, the hoarse, determined shouts of strong Ugly- Wuglies roused to resistance, and, worse than all, the steady pushing open of that narrow stone door that had almost closed upon the ghastly crew. Through the chink of it they could be seen, a writhing black crowd against the light of the bicycle lamp; a padded hand reached round the door; stick-boned arms stretched out angrily towards the world that that door, if it closed, would shut them off from for ever. And the tone of their consonantless speech was no longer conciliatory and ordinary; it was threatening, full of the menace of unbearable horrors. The padded hand fell on Gerald's arm, and instantly all the terrors that he had, so far, only known in imagination became real to him, and he saw, in the sort of flash that shows drowning people their past lives, what it was that he had asked of Mabel, and that she had given. 'Push, push for your life!' he cried, and setting his heel against the pedestal of Flora, pushed manfully. 'I can't any more oh, I can't!' moaned Mabel, and tried to use her heel likewise but her legs were too short. 'They mustn't get out, they mustn't!' Gerald panted. 'You'll know it when we do,' came from inside the door in tones which fury and mouth-rooflessness would have made unintelligible to any ears but those sharpened by the wild fear of that unspeakable moment. 'What's up, there?' cried suddenly a new voice a voice with all its consonants comforting, clean-cut, and ringing, and abruptly a new shadow fell on the marble floor of Flora's temple. 'Come and help push!' Gerald's voice only just reached the newcomer. 'If they get out they'll kill us all.' A strong, velveteen-covered shoulder pushed suddenly between the shoulders of Gerald and Mabel; a stout man's heel sought the aid of the goddess's pedestal; the heavy, narrow door yielded slowly, it closed, its spring clicked, and the furious, surging, threatening mass of Ugly-Wuglies was shut in, and Gerald and Mabel oh, incredible relief! were shut out. Mabel threw herself on the marble floor, sobbing slow, heavy sobs of achievement and exhaustion. If I had been there I should have looked the other way, so as not to see whether Gerald yielded himself to the same abandonment. The newcomer he appeared to be a gamekeeper Gerald decided later looked down on well, certainly on Mabel, and said: 'Come on, don't be a little duffer.' (He may have said, 'a couple of little duffers .) 'Who is it, and what's it all about?' 'I can't possibly tell you,' Gerald panted. 'We shall have to see about that, shan't we,' said the newcomer amiably. 'Come out into the moonlight and let's review the situation.' Gerald, even in that topsy-turvy state of his world, found time to think that a gamekeeper who used such words as that had most likely a romantic past. But at the same time he saw that such a man would be far less easy to 'square' with an unconvincing tale than Eliza, or Johnson, or even Mademoiselle. In fact, he seemed, with the only tale that they had to tell, practically unsquarable. Gerald got up if he was not up already, or still up  and pulled at the limp and now hot hand of the sobbing Mabel; and as he did so the unsquarable one took his hand, and thus led both children out from under the shadow of Flora's dome into the bright white moonlight that carpeted Flora's steps. Here he sat down, a child on each side of him, drew a hand of each through his velveteen arm, pressed them to his velveteen sides in a friendly, reassuring way, and said: 'Now then! Go ahead!' Mabel merely sobbed. We must excuse her. She had been very brave, and I have no doubt that all heroines, from Joan of Arc to Grace Darling, have had their sobbing moments. But Gerald said: 'It's no use. If I made up a story you'd see through it.' 'That's a compliment to thy discernment, anyhow,' said the stranger. 'What price telling me the truth?' 'If we told you the truth,' said Gerald, 'you wouldn't believe it.' 'Try me,' said the velveteen one. He was clean-shaven, and had large eyes that sparkled when the moonlight touched them. 'I can't,' said Gerald, and it was plain that he spoke the truth. 'You'd either think we were mad, and get us shut up, or else Oh, it's no good. Thank you for helping us, and do let us go home.' 'I wonder,' said the stranger musingly, 'whether you have any imagination.' 'Considering that we invented them ' Gerald hotly began, and stopped with late prudence. 'If by 'them' you mean the people whom I helped you to imprison in yonder tomb,' said the Stranger, loosing Mabel's hand to put his arm round her, 'remember that I saw and heard them. And with all respect to your imagination, I doubt whether any invention of yours would be quite so convincing.' Gerald put his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands. 'Collect yourself,' said the one in velveteen; 'and while you are collecting, let me just put the thing from my point of view. I think you hardly realize my position. I come down from London to take care of a big estate.' 'I thought you were a gamekeeper,' put in Gerald. Mabel put her head on the stranger's shoulder. 'Hero in disguise, then, I know,' she sniffed. 'Not at all,' said he; 'bailiff would be nearer the mark. On the very first evening I go out to take the moonlit air, and approaching a white building, hear sounds of an agitated scuffle, accompanied by frenzied appeals for assistance. Carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment, I do assist and shut up goodness knows who behind a stone door. Now, is it unreasonable that I should ask who it is that I've shut up helped to shut up, I mean, and who it is that I've assisted?' 'It's reasonable enough,' Gerald admitted. 'Well then,' said the stranger. 'Well then,' said Gerald, 'the fact is No,' he added after a pause, 'the fact is, I simply can't tell you.' 'Then I must ask the other side,' said Velveteens. 'Let me go I'll undo that door and find out for myself.' 'Tell him,' said Mabel, speaking for the first time. 'Never mind if he believes or not. We can't have them let out.' 'Very well,' said Gerald, 'I'll tell him. Now look here, Mr. Bailiff, will you promise us on an English gentleman's word of honour because, of course, I can see you're that, bailiff or not will you promise that you won't tell any one what we tell you and that you won't have us put in a lunatic asylum, however mad we sound?' 'Yes,' said the stranger, 'I think I can promise that. But if you've been having a sham fight or anything and shoved the other side into that hole, don't you think you'd better let them out? They'll be most awfully frightened, you know. After all, I suppose they are only children.' 'Wait till you hear,' Gerald answered. 'They're not children not much! Shall I just tell about them or begin at the beginning?' 'The beginning, of course,' said the stranger. Mabel lifted her head from his velveteen shoulder and said, 'Let me begin, then. I found a ring, and I said it would make me invisible. I said it in play. And it did. I was invisible twenty-one hours. Never mind where I got the ring. Now, Gerald, you go on.' Gerald went on; for quite a long time he went on, for the story was a splendid one to tell. 'And so,' he ended, 'we got them in there; and when seven hours are over, or fourteen, or twenty-one, or something with a seven in it, they'll just be old coats again. They came alive at half-past nine. I think they'll stop being it in seven hours that's half-past four. Now will you let us go home?''I'll see you home,' said the stranger in a quite new tone of exasperating gentleness. 'Come let's be going.' 'You don't believe us,' said Gerald. 'Of course you don t. Nobody could. But I could make you believe if I chose.' All three stood up, and the stranger stared in Gerald's eyes till Gerald answered his thought. 'No, I don't look mad, do I?' 'No, you aren't. But, come, you're an extraordinarily sensible boy; don't you think you may be sickening for a fever or something?' 'And Cathy and Jimmy and Mademoiselle and Eliza, and the man who said 'Guy Fawkes, swelp me!' and you, you saw them move you heard them call out. Are you sickening for anything?' 'No or at least not for anything but information. Come, and I'll see you home.' 'Mabel lives at the Towers,' said Gerald, as the stranger turned into the broad drive that leads to the big gate. 'No relation to Lord Yalding,' said Mabel hastily ' housekeeper's niece.' She was holding on to his hand all the way. At the servants entrance she put up her face to be kissed, and went in. 'Poor little thing!' said the bailiff, as they went down the drive towards the gate. He went with Gerald to the door of the school. 'Look here,' said Gerald at parting. 'I know what you're going to do. You're going to try to undo that door.' 'Discerning!' said the stranger. 'Well don't. Or, anyway, wait till daylight and let us be there. We can get there by ten.' 'All right I'll meet you there by ten,' answered the stranger. 'By George! you're the rummest kids I ever met.' 'We are rum,' Gerald owned, 'but so would you be if Good-night.' As the four children went over the smooth lawn towards Flora's Temple they talked, as they had talked all the morning, about the adventures of last night and of Mabel's bravery. It was not ten, but half-past twelve; for Eliza, backed by Mademoiselle, had insisted on their 'clearing up,' and clearing up very thoroughly, the 'litter' of last night. 'You're a Victoria Cross heroine, dear,' said Cathy warmly. 'You ought to have a statue put up to you.' 'It would come alive if you put it here,' said Gerald grimly. 'I shouldn't have been afraid,' said Jimmy. 'By daylight,' Gerald assured him, 'everything looks so jolly different.' 'I do hope he'll be there,' Mabel said; 'he was such a dear, Cathy a perfect bailiff, with the soul of a gentleman.' 'He isn't there, though,' said Jimmy. 'I believe you just dreamed him, like you did the statues coming alive.' They went up the marble steps in the sunshine, and it was difficult to believe that this was the place where only in last night's moonlight fear had laid such cold hands on the hearts of Mabel and Gerald. 'Shall we open the door,' suggested Kathleen, 'and begin to carry home the coats?' 'Let's listen first,' said Gerald; 'perhaps they aren't only coats yet.' They laid ears to the hinges of the stone door, behind which last night the Ugly-Wuglies had shrieked and threatened. All was still as the sweet morning itself. It was as they turned away that they saw the man they had come to meet. He was on the other side of Flora's pedestal. But he was not standing up. He lay there, quite still, on his back, his arms flung wide. 'Oh, look!' cried Cathy, and pointed. His face was a queer greenish colour, and on his forehead there was a cut; its edges were blue, and a little blood had trickled from it on to the white of the marble. At the same time Mabel pointed too but she did not cry out as Cathy had done. And what she pointed at was a big glossy-leaved rhododendron bush, from which a painted pointed paper face peered out very white, very red, in the sunlight and, as the children gazed, shrank back into the cover of the shining leaves. It was but too plain. The unfortunate bailiff must have opened the door before the spell had faded, while yet the Ugly Wuglies were something more than mere coats and hats and sticks. They had rushed out upon him, and had done this. He lay there insensible was it a golf-club or a hockey-stick that had made that horrible cut on his forehead? Gerald wondered. The girls had rushed to the sufferer; already his head was in Mabel's lap. Kathleen had tried to get it on to hers, but Mabel was too quick for her. Jimmy and Gerald both knew what was the first thing needed by the unconscious, even before Mabel impatiently said: 'Water! water!' 'What in?' Jimmy asked, looking doubtfully at his hands, and then down the green slope to the marble-bordered pool where the water-lilies were. 'Your hat anything,' said Mabel. The two boys turned away. 'Suppose they come after us,' said Jimmy. 'What come after us?' Gerald snapped rather than asked. 'The Ugly-Wuglies,' Jimmy whispered.. 'Who's afraid?' Gerald inquired. But he looked to right and left very carefully, and chose the way that did not lead near the bushes. He scooped water up in his straw hat and returned to Flora's Temple, carrying it carefully in both hands. When he saw how quickly it ran through the straw he pulled his handkerchief from his breast pocket with his teeth and dropped it into the hat. It was with this that the girls wiped the blood from the bailiff's brow. 'We ought to have smelling salts,' said Kathleen, half in tears. 'I know we ought.' 'They would be good,' Mabel owned. 'Hasn't your aunt any?' 'Yes, but ' 'Don't be a coward,' said Gerald; 'think of last night. They wouldn't hurt you. He must have insulted them or something. Look here, you run. We'll see that nothing runs after you.' There was no choice but to relinquish the head of the interesting invalid to Kathleen; so Mabel did it, cast one glaring glance round the rhododendron bordered slope, and fled towards the castle. The other three bent over the still unconscious bailiff. 'He's not dead, is he?' asked Jimmy anxiously. 'No,' Kathleen reassured him, 'his heart's heating. Mabel and I felt it in his wrist, where doctors do. How frightfully good-looking he is!' 'Not so dusty,' Gerald admitted. 'I never know what you mean by good-looking,' said Jimmy, and suddenly a shadow fell on the marble beside them and a fourth voice spoke not Mabel s; her hurrying figure, though still in sight, was far away. The children looked up into the face of the eldest of the Ugly-Wuglies, the respectable one. Jimmy and Kathleen screamed. I am sorry, but they did. 'Hush!' said Gerald savagely: he was still wearing the ring. 'Hold your tongues! I'll get him away,' he added in a whisper. 'Very sad affair this,' said the respectable Ugly-Wugly. He spoke with a curious accent; there was something odd about his r's, and his m's and n's were those of a person labouring under an almost intolerable cold in the head. But it was not the dreadful 'oo' and 'ah' voice of the night before. Kathleen and Jimmy stooped over the bailiff. Even that prostrate form, being human, seemed some little protection. But Gerald, strong in the fearlessness that the ring gave to its wearer, looked full into the face of the Ugly-Wugly and started. For though the face was almost the same as the face he had himself painted on the school drawing-paper, it was not the same. For it was no longer paper. It was a real face, and the hands, lean and almost transparent as they were, were real hands. As it moved a little to get a better view of the bailiff it was plain that it had legs, arms live legs and arms, and a self-supporting backbone. It was alive indeed with a vengeance. 'How did it happen?' Gerald asked, with an effort of calmness a successful effort. 'Most regrettable,' said the Ugly-Wugly. 'The others must have missed the way last night in the passage. They never found the hotel.' 'Did you?' asked Gerald blankly. 'Of course,' said the Ugly-Wugly. 'Most respectable, exactly as you said. Then when I came away I didn't come the front way because I wanted to revisit this sylvan scene by daylight, and the hotel people didn't seem to know how to direct me to it I found the others all at this door, very angry. They'd been here all night, trying to get out. Then the door opened this gentleman must have opened it and before I could protect him, that underbred man in the high hat you remember ,' Gerald remembered. 'Hit him on the head, and he fell where you see him. The others dispersed, and I myself was just going for assistance when I saw you.' Here Jimmy was discovered to be in tears and Kathleen white as any drawing-paper. 'What's the matter, my little man?' said the respectable Ugly-Wugly kindly. Jimmy passed instantly from tears to yells. 'Here, take the ring!' said Gerald in a furious whisper, and thrust it on to Jimmy's hot, damp, resisting finger. Jimmy's voice stopped short in the middle of a howl. And Gerald in a cold flash realized what it was that Mabel had gone through the night before. But it was daylight, and Gerald was not a coward. 'We must find the others,' he said. 'I imagine,' said the elderly Ugly-Wugly, 'that they have gone to bathe. Their clothes are in the wood.' He pointed stiffly. 'You two go and see,' said Gerald. 'I'll go on dabbing this chap's head.' In the wood Jimmy, now fearless as any lion, discovered four heaps of clothing, with broomsticks, hockeysticks, and masks complete all that had gone to make up the gentlemen Ugly-Wuglies of the night before. On a stone seat well in the sun sat the two lady Ugly-Wuglies, and Kathleen approached them gingerly. Valour is easier in the sunshine than at night, as we all know. When she and Jimmy came close to the bench, they saw that the Ugly-Wuglies were only Ugly-Wuglies such as they had often made. There was no life in them. Jimmy shook them to pieces, and a sigh of relief burst from Kathleen. 'The spell's broken, you see,' she said; 'and that old gentleman, he's real. He only happens to be like the Ugly-Wugly we made.' 'He's got the coat that hung in the hall on, anyway,' said Jimmy. 'No, it's only like it. Let's get back to the unconscious stranger.' They did, and Gerald begged the elderly Ugly-Wugly to retire among the bushes with Jimmy; 'because, said he, 'I think the poor bailiff's coming round, and it might upset him to see strangers and Jimmy'll keep you company. He's the best one of us to go with you,' he added hastily. And this, since Jimmy had the ring, was certainly true. So the two disappeared behind the rhododendrons. Mabel came back with the salts just as the bailiff opened his eyes. 'It's just like life,' she said; 'I might just as well not have gone. However ,' She knelt down at once and held the bottle under the sufferer's nose till he sneezed and feebly pushed her hand away with the faint question: 'What's up now?' 'You've hurt your head,' said Gerald. 'Lie still.' 'No more smelling-bottle,' he said weakly, and lay. Quite soon he sat up and looked round him. There was an anxious silence. Here was a grown-up who knew last night's secret, and none of the children were at all sure what the utmost rigour of the law might be in a case where people, no matter how young, made Ugly-Wuglies, and brought them to life dangerous, fighting, angry life. What would he say what would he do?' He said: 'What an odd thing! Have I been insensible long?' 'Hours,' said Mabel earnestly. 'Not long,' said Kathleen. 'We don't know. We found you like it,' said Gerald. 'I'm all right now,' said the bailiff, and his eye fell on the blood-stained handkerchief. 'I say, I did give my head a bang. And you've been giving me first aid. Thank you most awfully. But it is rum.' 'What's rum?' politeness obliged Gerald to ask. 'Well, I suppose it isn't really rum I expect I saw you just before I fainted, or whatever it was but I've dreamed the most extraordinary dream while I've been insensible and you were in it.' 'Nothing but us?' asked Mabel breathlessly. 'Oh, lots of things impossible things but you were real enough.' Everyone breathed deeply in relief. It was indeed, as they agreed later, a lucky let-off. 'Are you sure you're all right?' they all asked, as he got on his feet. 'Perfectly, thank you.' He glanced behind Flora's statue as he spoke. 'Do you know, I dreamed there was a door there, but of course there isn't. I don't know how to thank you,' he added, looking at them with what the girls called his beautiful, kind eyes; 'it's lucky for me you came along. You come here whenever you like, you know,' he added. 'I give you the freedom of the place.' 'You're the new bailiff, aren't you?' said Mabel. 'Yes. How did you know?' he asked quickly; but they did not tell him how they knew. Instead, they found out which way he was going, and went the other way after warm handshakes and hopes on both sides that they would meet again soon. 'I'll tell you what,' said Gerald, as they watched the tall, broad figure of the bailiff grow smaller across the hot green of the grass slope, 'have you got any idea of how we're going to spend the day? Because I have.' The others hadn't. 'We'll get rid of that Ugly-Wugly oh, we'll find a way right enough and directly we've done it we'll go home and seal up the ring in an envelope so that its teeth'll be drawn and it'll be powerless to have unforeseen larks with us. Then we'll get out on the roof, and have a quiet day books and apples. I'm about fed up with adventures, so I tell you.' The others told him the same thing. 'Now, think,' said he 'think as you never thought before how to get rid of that Ugly-Wugly.' Everyone thought, but their brains were tired with anxiety and distress, and the thoughts they thought were, as Mabel said, not worth thinking, let alone saying. 'I suppose Jimmy's all right,' said Kathleen anxiously. 'Oh, he's all right: he's got the ring,' said Gerald. 'I hope he won't go wishing anything rotten,' said Mabel, but Gerald urged her to shut up and let him think. 'I think I think best sitting down,' he said, and sat; 'and sometimes you can think best aloud. The Ugly-Wugly's real don't make any mistake about that. And he got made real inside that passage. If we could get him back there he might get changed again, and then we could take the coats and things back.' 'Isn't there any other way?' Kathleen asked; and Mabel, more candid, said bluntly: 'I'm not going into that passage, so there!' 'Afraid! In broad daylight,' Gerald sneered. 'It wouldn't be broad daylight in there,' said Mabel, and Kathleen shivered. 'If we went to him and suddenly tore his coat off,' said she 'he is only coats he couldn't go on being real then. 'Couldn't he!' said Gerald. 'You don't know what he's like under the coat.' Kathleen shivered again. And all this time the sun was shining gaily and the white statues and the green trees and the fountains and terraces looked as cheerfully romantic as a scene in a play. 'Anyway,' said Gerald, 'we'll try to get him back, and shut the door. That's the most we can hope for. And then apples, and Robinson Crusoe or the Swiss Family, or any book you like that's got no magic in it. Now, we've just got to do it. And he's not horrid now; really he isn't. He's real, you see.' 'I suppose that makes all the difference,' said Mabel, and tried to feel that perhaps it did. 'And it's broad daylight just look at the sun,' Gerald insisted. 'Come on!' He took a hand of each, and they walked resolutely towards the bank of rhododendrons behind which Jimmy and the Ugly-Wugly had been told to wait, and as they went Gerald said: 'He's real' 'The sun's shining' 'It'll all be over in a minute.' And he said these things again and again, so that there should be no mistake about them. As they neared the bushes the shining leaves rustled, shivered, and parted, and before the girls had time to begin to hang back Jimmy came blinking out into the sunlight. The boughs closed behind him, and they did not stir or rustle for the appearance of anyone else. Jimmy was alone. 'Where is it?' asked the girls in one breath. 'Walking up and down in a fir-walk,' said Jimmy, 'doing sums in a book. He says he's most frightfully rich, and he's got to get up to town to the Stocks or something where they change papers into gold if you're clever, he says. I should like to go to the Stocks-change, wouldn't you?' 'I don't seem to care very much about changes, said Gerald. 'I've had enough. Show us where he is we must get rid of him.' 'He's got a motor-car,' Jimmy went on, parting the warm varnished-looking rhododendron leaves, 'and a garden with a tennis-court and a lake and a carriage and pair, and he goes to Athens for his holiday sometimes, just like other people go to Margate.' 'The best thing,' said Gerald, following through the bushes, 'will be to tell him the shortest way out is through that hotel that he thinks he found last night. Then we get him into the passage, give him a push, fly back, and shut the door.' 'He'll starve to death in there,' said Kathleen, 'if he's really real.' 'I expect it doesn't last long, the ring magics don't  anyway, it's the only thing I can think of.' 'He's frightfully rich,' Jimmy went on unheeding amid the cracking of the bushes; 'he's building a public library for the people where he lives, and having his portrait painted to put in it. He thinks they'll like that.' The belt of rhododendrons was passed, and the children had reached a smooth grass walk bordered by tall pines and firs of strange different kinds. 'He's just round that corner,' said Jimmy. 'He's simply rolling in money. He doesn't know what to do with it. He's been building a horse-trough and drinking fountain with a bust of himself on top. Why doesn't he build a private swimming-bath close to his bed, so that he can just roll off into it of a morning? I wish I was rich; I'd soon show him ,' 'That's a sensible wish,' said Gerald. 'I wonder we didn't think of doing that. Oh, criky!' he added, and with reason. For there, in the green shadows of the pine-walk, in the woodland silence, broken only by rustling leaves and the agitated breathing of the three unhappy others, Jimmy got his wish. By quick but perfectly plain-to-be-seen degrees Jimmy became rich. And the horrible thing was that though they could see it happening they did not know what was happening, and could not have stopped it if they had. All they could see was Jimmy, their own Jimmy, whom they had larked with and quarrelled with and made it up with ever since they could remember, Jimmy continuously and horribly growing old. The whole thing was over in a few seconds. Yet in those few seconds they saw him grow to a youth, a young man, a middle-aged man; and then, with a sort of shivering shock, unspeakably horrible and definite, he seemed to settle down into an elderly gentleman, handsomely but rather dowdily dressed, who was looking down at them through spectacles and asking them the nearest way to the railway-station. If they had not seen the change take place, in all its awful details, they would never have guessed that this stout, prosperous, elderly gentleman with the high hat, the frock-coat, and the large red seal dangling from the curve of a portly waistcoat, was their own Jimmy. But, as they had seen it, they knew the dreadful truth. 'Oh, Jimmy, don't!' cried Mabel desperately. Gerald said: 'This is perfectly beastly,' and Kathleen broke into wild weeping. 'Don't cry, little girl!' said That-which-had-been Jimmy; 'and you, boy, can't you give a civil answer to a civil question?' 'He doesn't know us!' wailed Kathleen. 'Who doesn't know you?' said That-which-had-been impatiently. 'You y-you don t!' Kathleen sobbed. 'I certainly don't,' returned That-which 'but surely that need not distress you so deeply.' 'Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy!' Kathleen sobbed louder than before. 'He doesn't know us,' Gerald owned, 'or look here, Jimmy, y you aren't kidding, are you? Because if you are it's simply abject rot ' 'My name is Mr.  ,' said That-which-had-been-Jimmy, and gave the name correctly. By the way, it will perhaps be shorter to call this elderly stout person who was Jimmy grown rich by some simpler name than I have just used. Let us call him 'That'  short for 'That-which-had-been Jimmy'. 'What are we to do?' whispered Mabel, awestruck; and aloud she said: 'Oh, Mr. James, or whatever you call yourself, do give me the ring.' For on That's finger the fatal ring showed plain. 'Certainly not,' said That firmly. 'You appear to be a very grasping child.' 'But what are you going to do?' Gerald asked in the flat tones of complete hopelessness. 'Your interest is very flattering,' said That. 'Will you tell me, or won't you, the way to the nearest railway station?' 'No,' said Gerald, 'we won't.' 'Then,' said That, still politely, though quite plainly furious, 'perhaps you'll tell me the way to the nearest lunatic asylum?' 'Oh, no, no, no!' cried Kathleen. 'You're not so bad as that.' 'Perhaps not. But you are,' That retorted; 'if you're not lunatics you're idiots. However, I see a gentleman ahead who is perhaps sane. In fact, I seem to recognize him.' A gentleman, indeed, was now to be seen approaching. It was the elderly Ugly-Wugly. 'Oh! don't you remember Jerry?' Kathleen cried, 'and Cathy, your own Cathy Puss Cat? Dear, dear Jimmy, don't be so silly!' 'Little girl,' said That, looking at her crossly through his spectacles, 'I am sorry you have not been better brought up.' And he walked stiffly towards the Ugly-Wugly. Two hats were raised, a few words were exchanged, and two elderly figures walked side by side down the green pine-walk, followed by three miserable children, horrified, bewildered, alarmed, and, what is really worse than anything, quite at their wits end. 'He wished to be rich, so of course he is,' said Gerald; 'he'll have money for tickets and everything. And when the spell breaks it's sure to break, isn't it? he'll find himself somewhere awful  perhaps in a really good hotel and not know how he got there.' 'I wonder how long the Ugly-Wuglies lasted,' said Mabel. 'Yes,' Gerald answered, 'that reminds me. You two must collect the coats and things. Hide them, anywhere you like, and we'll carry them home tomorrow if there is any tomorrow ' he added darkly. 'Oh, don t!' said Kathleen, once more breathing heavily on the verge of tears: 'you wouldn't think everything could be so awful, and the sun shining like it does. 'Look here,' said Gerald, 'of course I must stick to Jimmy. You two must go home to Mademoiselle and tell her Jimmy and I have gone off in the train with a gentleman say he looked like an uncle. He does some kind of uncle. There'll be a beastly row afterwards, but it's got to be done. 'It all seems thick with lies,' said Kathleen; 'you don't seem to be able to get a word of truth in edgewise hardly.' 'Don't you worry,' said her brother; 'they aren't lies  they're as true as anything else in this magic rot we've got mixed up in. It's like telling lies in a dream; you can't help it.' 'Well, all I know is I wish it would stop.' 'Lot of use your wishing that is,' said Gerald, exasperated. 'So long. I've got to go, and you've got to stay. If it's any comfort to you, I don't believe any of it's real: it can't be; it's too thick. Tell Mademoiselle Jimmy and I will be back to tea. If we don't happen to be I can't help it. I can't help anything, except perhaps Jimmy.' He started to run, for the girls had lagged, and the Ugly-Wugly and That (late Jimmy) had quickened their pace. The girls were left looking after them. 'We've got to find these clothes,' said Mabel, 'simply got to. I used to want to be a heroine. It's different when it really comes to being, isn't it?' 'Yes, very,' said Kathleen. 'Where shall we hide the clothes when we've got them? Not not that passage?' 'Never!' said Mabel firmly; 'we'll hide them inside the great stone dinosaurus. He's hollow.' 'He comes alive in his stone,' said Kathleen. 'Not in the sunshine he doesn't,' Mabel told her confidently, 'and not without the ring.' 'There won't be any apples and books today,' said Kathleen. 'No, but we'll do the babiest thing we can do the minute we get home. We'll have a dolls tea-party. That'll make us feel as if there wasn't really any magic.' 'It'll have to be a very strong tea party, then,' said Kathleen doubtfully. And now we see Gerald, a small but quite determined figure, paddling along in the soft white dust of the sunny road, in the wake of two elderly gentlemen. His hand, in his trousers pocket, buries itself with a feeling of satisfaction in the heavy mixed coinage that is his share of the profits of his conjuring at the fair. His noiseless tennis-shoes bear him to the station, where, unobserved, he listens at the ticket office to the voice of That-which-was-James. 'One first London,' it says and Gerald, waiting till That and the Ugly-Wugly have strolled on to the platform, politely conversing of politics and the Kaffir market, takes a third return to London. The train strides in, squeaking and puffing. The watched take their seats in a carriage blue-lined. The watcher springs into a yellow wooden compartment. A whistle sounds, a flag is waved. The train pulls itself together, strains, jerks, and starts. 'I don't understand,' says Gerald, alone in his third- class carriage, 'how railway trains and magic can go on at the same time.' And yet they do. Mabel and Kathleen, nervously peering among the rhododendron bushes and the bracken and the fancy fir-trees, find six several heaps of coats, hats, skirts, gloves, golf-clubs, hockey- sticks, broom-handles. They carry them, panting and damp, for the mid-day sun is pitiless, up the hill to where the stone dinosaurus looms immense among a forest of larches. The dinosaurus has a hole in his stomach. Kathleen shows Mabel how to 'make a back' and climbs up on it into the cold, stony inside of the monster. Mabel hands up the clothes and the sticks. 'There's lots of room,' says Kathleen; 'its tail goes down into the ground. It's like a secret passage.' 'Suppose something comes out of it and jumps out at you,' says Mabel, and Kathleen hurriedly descends. The explanations to Mademoiselle promise to be difficult, but, as Kathleen said afterwards, any little thing is enough to take a grown-up's attention off. A figure passes the window just as they are explaining that it really did look exactly like an uncle that the boys have gone to London with. 'Who's that?' says Mademoiselle suddenly, pointing, too, which everyone knows is not manners. It is the bailiff coming back from the doctor's with antiseptic plaster on that nasty cut that took so long a-bathing this morning. They tell her it is the bailiff at Yalding Towers, and she says, 'Ciel!' (Sky!) and asks no more awkward questions about the boys. Lunch  very late is a silent meal. After lunch Mademoiselle goes out, in a hat with many pink roses, carrying a rose-lined parasol. The girls, in dead silence, organize a dolls tea-party, with real tea. At the second cup Kathleen bursts into tears. Mabel, also weeping, embraces her. 'I wish,' sobs Kathleen, 'oh, I do wish I knew where the boys were! It would be such a comfort.' Gerald knew where the boys were, and it was no comfort to him at all. If you come to think of it, he was the only person who could know where they were, because Jimmy didn't know that he was a boy and indeed he wasn't really and the Ugly-Wugly couldn't be expected to know anything real, such as where boys were. At the moment when the second cup of dolls tea  very strong, but not strong enough to drown care in  was being poured out by the trembling hand of Kathleen, Gerald was lurking there really is no other word for it on the staircase of Aldermanbury Buildings, Old Broad Street. On the floor below him was a door bearing the legend 'MR. U. W. UGLI, Stock and Share Broker (and at the Stock Exchange)' and on the floor above was another door, on which was the name of Gerald's little brother, now grown suddenly rich in so magic and tragic a way. There were no explaining words under Jimmy's name. Gerald could not guess what walk in life it was to which That (which had been Jimmy) owed its affluence. He had seen, when the door opened to admit his brother, a tangle of clerks and mahogany desks. Evidently That had a large business. What was Gerald to do? What could he do? It is almost impossible, especially for one so young as Gerald, to enter a large London office and explain that the elderly and respected head of it is not what he seems, but is really your little brother, who has been suddenly advanced to age and wealth by a tricky wishing ring. If you think it's a possible thing, try it, that's all. Nor could he knock at the door of Mr. U. W. Ugli, Stock and Share Broker (and at the Stock Exchange), and inform his clerks that their chief was really nothing but old clothes that had accidentally come alive, and by some magic, which he couldn't attempt to explain, become real during a night spent at a really good hotel which had no existence. The situation bristled, as you see, with difficulties. And it was so long past Gerald's proper dinner-time that his increasing hunger was rapidly growing to seem the most important difficulty of all. It is quite possible to starve to death on the staircase of a London building if the people you are watching for only stay long enough in their offices. The truth of this came home to Gerald more and more painfully. A boy with hair like a new front door mat came whistling up the stairs. He had a dark blue bag in his hands. 'I'll give you a tanner for yourself if you'll get me a tanner's worth of buns,' said Gerald, with that prompt decision common to all great commanders. 'Show us yer tanners,' the boy rejoined with at least equal promptness. Gerald showed them. 'All right; hand over.' 'Payment on delivery,' said Gerald, using words from the drapers which he had never thought to use. The boy grinned admiringly. 'Knows 'is wy abaht,' he said; 'ain't no flies on 'im.' 'Not many,' Gerald owned with modest pride. 'Cut along, there's a good chap. I've got to wait here. I'll take care of your bag if you like.' 'Nor yet there ain't no flies on me neither,' remarked the boy, shouldering it. 'I been up to the confidence trick for years ever since I was your age.' With this parting shot he went, and returned in due course bun-laden. Gerald gave the sixpence and took the buns. When the boy, a minute later, emerged from the door of Mr. U. W. Ugli, Stock and Share Broker (and at the Stock Exchange), Gerald stopped him. 'What sort of chap's that?' he asked, pointing the question with a jerk of an explaining thumb. 'Awful big pot,' said the boy; 'up to his eyes in oof. Motor and all that.' 'Know anything about the one on the next landing?' 'He's bigger than what this one is. Very old firm special cellar in the Bank of England to put his chink in all in bins like against the wall at the corn-chandler s. Jimminy, I wouldn't mind 'alf an hour in there, and the doors open and the police away at a beano. Not much! Neither. You'll bust if you eat all them buns.' 'Have one?' Gerald responded, and held out the bag. 'They say in our office,' said the boy, paying for the bun honourably with unasked information, 'as these two is all for cutting each other's throats oh, only in the way of business been at it for years.' Gerald wildly wondered what magic and how much had been needed to give history and a past to these two things of yesterday, the rich Jimmy and the Ugly-Wugly. If he could get them away would all memory of them fade in this boy's mind, for instance, in the minds of all the people who did business with them in the City? Would the mahogany-and-clerk-furnished offices fade away? Were the clerks real? Was the mahogany? Was he himself real? Was the boy? 'Can you keep a secret?' he asked the other boy. 'Are you on for a lark?' 'I ought to be getting back to the office,' said the boy. 'Get then!' said Gerald. 'Don't you get stuffy,' said the boy. 'I was just a-going to say it didn't matter. I know how to make my nose bleed if I'm a bit late.' Gerald congratulated him on this accomplishment, at once so useful and so graceful, and then said: 'Look here. I'll give you five bob honest.' 'What for?' was the boy's natural question. 'If you'll help me. ' 'Fire ahead.' 'I'm a private inquiry,' said Gerald. 'Tec? You don't look it.' 'What's the good of being one if you look it?' Gerald asked impatiently, beginning on another bun. 'That old chap on the floor above he's wanted.' 'Police?' asked the boy with fine carelessness. 'No sorrowing relations.' ''Return to,'' said the boy; ''all forgotten and forgiven.' I see.' 'And I've got to get him to them, somehow. Now, if you could go in and give him a message from someone who wanted to meet him on business ,' 'Hold on!' said the boy. 'I know a trick worth two of that. You go in and see old Ugli. He'd give his ears to have the old boy out of the way for a day or two. They were saying so in our office only this morning.' 'Let me think,' said Gerald, laying down the last bun on his knee expressly to hold his head in his hands. 'Don't you forget to think about my five bob,' said the boy. Then there was a silence on the stairs, broken only by the cough of a clerk in That's office, and the clickety-clack of a typewriter in the office of Mr. U. W. Ugli. Then Gerald rose up and finished the bun. 'You're right,' he said. 'I'll chance it. Here's your five bob.' He brushed the bun crumbs from his front, cleared his throat, and knocked at the door of Mr. U. W. Ugli. It opened and he entered. The door-mat boy lingered, secure in his power to account for his long absence by means of his well-trained nose, and his waiting was rewarded. He went down a few steps, round the bend of the stairs, and heard the voice of Mr. U. W. Ugli, so well known on that staircase (and on the Stock Exchange) say in soft, cautious accents: 'Then I'll ask him to let me look at the ring and I'll drop it. You pick it up. But remember, it's a pure accident, and you don't know me. I can't have my name mixed up in a thing like this. You're sure he's really unhinged?' 'Quite,' said Gerald; 'he's quite mad about that ring. He'll follow it anywhere. I know he will. And think of his sorrowing relations.' 'I do I do,' said Mr. Ugli kindly; 'that's all I do think of, of course.' He went up the stairs to the other office, and Gerald heard the voice of That telling his clerks that he was going out to lunch. Then the horrible Ugly-Wugly and Jimmy, hardly less horrible in the eyes of Gerald, passed down the stairs where, in the dusk of the lower landing, two boys were making themselves as undistinguishable as possible, and so out into the street, talking of stocks and shares, bears and bulls. The two boys followed. 'I say,' the door-mat-headed boy whispered admiringly, 'whatever are you up to?' 'You'll see,' said Gerald recklessly. 'Come on!' 'You tell me. I must be getting back.' 'Well, I'll tell you, but you won't believe me. That old gentleman's not really old at all he's my young brother suddenly turned into what you see. The other's not real at all. He's only just old clothes and nothing inside.' 'He looks it, I must say,' the boy admitted; 'but I say you do stick it on, don't you?' 'Well, my brother was turned like that by a magic ring.' 'There ain't no such thing as magic,' said the boy. 'I learnt that at school.' 'All right,' said Gerald. 'Good-bye.' 'Oh, go ahead!' said the boy; 'you do stick it on, though.' 'Well, that magic ring. If I can get hold of It I shall just wish we were all in a certain place. And we shall be. And then I can deal with both of them.' 'Deal?' 'Yes, the ring won't unwish anything you've wished. That undoes itself with time, like a spring uncoiling. But it'll give you a brand-new wish I'm almost certain of it. Anyhow, I'm going to chance it.' 'You are a rotter, aren't you?' said the boy respectfully. 'You wait and see,' Gerald repeated. 'I say, you aren't going into this swell place! You can't?' The boy paused, appalled at the majesty of Pym's. 'Yes, I am they can't turn us out as long as we behave. You come along, too. I'll stand lunch.' I don't know why Gerald clung so to this boy. He wasn't a very nice boy. Perhaps it was because he was the only person Gerald knew in London to speak to  except That-which-had-been-Jimmy and the Ugly-Wugly; and he did not want to talk to either of them. What happened next happened so quickly that, as Gerald said later, it was 'just like magic'. The restaurant was crowded busy men were hastily bolting the food hurriedly brought by busy waitresses. There was a clink of forks and plates, the gurgle of beer from bottles, the hum of talk, and the smell of many good things to eat. 'Two chops, please,' Gerald had just said, playing with a plainly shown handful of money, so as to leave no doubt of his honourable intentions. Then at the next table he heard the words, 'Ah, yes, curious old family heirloom,' the ring was drawn off the finger of That, and Mr. U. W. Ugli, murmuring something about a unique curio, reached his impossible hand out for it. The door-mat-headed boy was watching breathlessly. 'There's a ring right enough,' he owned. And then the ring slipped from the hand of Mr. U. W. Ugli and skidded along the floor. Gerald pounced on it like a greyhound on a hare. He thrust the dull circlet on his finger and cried out aloud in that crowded place: 'I wish Jimmy and I were inside that door behind the statue of Flora.' It was the only safe place he could think of. The lights and sounds and scents of the restaurant died away as a wax-drop dies in fire a rain-drop in water. I don't know, and Gerald never knew, what happened in that restaurant. There was nothing about it in the papers, though Gerald looked anxiously for 'Extraordinary Disappearance of well-known City Man.' What the door-mat-headed boy did or thought I don't know either. No more does Gerald. But he would like to know, whereas I don't care tuppence. The world went on all right, anyhow, whatever he thought or did. The lights and the sounds and the scents of Pym's died out. In place of the light there was darkness; in place of the sounds there was silence; and in place of the scent of beef, pork, mutton, fish, veal, cabbage, onions, carrots, beer, and tobacco there was the musty, damp scent of a place underground that has been long shut up. Gerald felt sick and giddy, and there was something at the back of his mind that he knew would make him feel sicker and giddier as soon as he should have the sense to remember what it was. Meantime it was important to think of proper words to soothe the City man that had once been Jimmy to keep him quiet till Time, like a spring uncoiling, should bring the reversal of the spell make all things as they were and as they ought to be. But he fought in vain for words. There were none. Nor were they needed. For through the deep darkness came a voice and it was not the voice of that City man who had been Jimmy, but the voice of that very Jimmy who was Gerald's little brother, and who had wished that unlucky wish for riches that could only be answered by changing all that was Jimmy, young and poor, to all that Jimmy, rich and old, would have been. Another voice said: 'Jerry, Jerry! Are you awake? I've had such a rum dream.' And then there was a moment when nothing was said or done. Gerald felt through the thick darkness, and the thick silence, and the thick scent of old earth shut up, and he got hold of Jimmy's hand. 'It's all right, Jimmy, old chap,' he said; 'it's not a dream now. It's that beastly ring again. I had to wish us here, to get you back at all out of your dream.' 'Wish us where?' Jimmy held on to the hand in a way that in the daylight of life he would have been the first to call babyish. 'Inside the passage behind the Flora statue,' said Gerald, adding, 'it's all right, really.' 'Oh, I dare say it's all right,' Jimmy answered through the dark, with an irritation not strong enough to make him loosen his hold of his brother's hand. 'But how are we going to get out?' Then Gerald knew what it was that was waiting to make him feel more giddy than the lightning flight from Cheapside to Yalding Towers had been able to make him. But he said stoutly: 'I'll wish us out, of course.' Though all the time he knew that the ring would not undo its given wishes. It didn't. Gerald wished. He handed the ring carefully to Jimmy, through the thick darkness. And Jimmy wished. And there they still were, in that black passage behind Flora, that had led in the case of one Ugly-Wugly at least to 'a good hotel'. And the stone door was shut. And they did not know even which way to turn to it. 'If I only had some matches!' said Gerald. 'Why didn't you leave me in the dream?' Jimmy almost whimpered. 'It was light there, and I was just going to have salmon and cucumber.' 'I,' rejoined Gerald in gloom, 'was just going to have steak and fried potatoes.' The silence, and the darkness, and the earthy scent were all they had now. 'I always wondered what it would be like,' said Jimmy in low, even tones, 'to be buried alive. And now I know! Oh! his voice suddenly rose to a shriek, 'it isn't true, it isn't! It's a dream that's what it is!' There was a pause while you could have counted ten. Then 'Yes,' said Gerald bravely, through the scent and the silence and the darkness, 'it's just a dream, Jimmy, old chap. We'll just hold on, and call out now and then just for the lark of the thing. But it's really only a dream, of course.' Of course, said Jimmy in the silence and the darkness and the scent of old earth. There is a curtain, thin as gossamer, clear as glass, strong as iron, that hangs for ever between the world of magic and the world that seems to us to be real. And when once people have found one of the little weak spots in that curtain which are marked by magic rings, and amulets, and the like, almost anything may happen. Thus it is not surprising that Mabel and Kathleen, conscientiously conducting one of the dullest dolls tea-parties at which either had ever assisted, should suddenly, and both at once, have felt a strange, unreasonable, but quite irresistible desire to return instantly to the Temple of Flora even at the cost of leaving the dolls tea-service in an unwashed state, and only half the raisins eaten. They went as one has to go when the magic impulse drives one against their better judgement, against their wills almost. And the nearer they came to the Temple of Flora, in the golden hush of the afternoon, the more certain each was that they could not possibly have done otherwise. And this explains exactly how it was that when Gerald and Jimmy, holding hands in the darkness of the passage, uttered their first concerted yell, 'just for the lark of the thing', that yell was instantly answered from outside. A crack of light showed in that part of the passage where they had least expected the door to be. The stone door itself swung slowly open, and they were out of it, in the Temple of Flora, blinking in the good daylight, an unresisting prey to Kathleen's embraces and the questionings of Mabel. 'And you left that Ugly-Wugly loose in London,' Mabel pointed out; 'you might have wished it to be with you, too.' 'It's all right where it is,' said Gerald. 'I couldn't think of everything. And besides, no, thank you! Now we'll go home and seal up the ring in an envelope.' 'I haven't done anything with the ring yet,' said Kathleen. 'I shouldn't think you'd want to when you see the sort of things it does with you,' said Gerald. 'It wouldn't do things like that if I was wishing with it,' Kathleen protested, 'Look here,' said Mabel, 'let's just put it back in the treasure-room and have done with it. I oughtn't ever to have taken it away, really. It's a sort of stealing. It's quite as bad, really, as Eliza borrowing it to astonish her gentleman friend with.' 'I don't mind putting it back if you like,' said Gerald, 'only if any of us do think of a sensible wish you'll let us have it out again, of course?' 'Of course, of course,' Mabel agreed. So they trooped up to the castle, and Mabel once more worked the spring that let down the panelling and showed the jewels, and the ring was put back among the odd dull ornaments that Mabel had once said were magic. 'How innocent it looks!' said Gerald. 'You wouldn't think there was any magic about it. It's just like an old silly ring. I wonder if what Mabel said about the other things is true! Suppose we try.' 'Don't!' said Kathleen. 'I think magic things are spiteful. They just enjoy getting you into tight places.' 'I'd like to try,' said Mabel, 'only well, everything's been rather upsetting, and I've forgotten what I said anything was.' So had the others. Perhaps that was why, when Gerald said that a bronze buckle laid on the foot would have the effect of seven-league boots, it didn't; when Jimmy, a little of the City man he had been clinging to him still, said that the steel collar would ensure your always having money in your pockets, his own remained empty; and when Mabel and Kathleen invented qualities of the most delightful nature for various rings and chains and brooches, nothing at all happened. 'It's only the ring that's magic,' said Mabel at last; 'and, I say!' she added, in quite a different voice. 'What?' 'Suppose even the ring isn't!' 'But we know it is.' 'I don't,' said Mabel. 'I believe it's not today at all. I believe it's the other day we've just dreamed all these things. It's the day I made up that nonsense about the ring.' 'No, it isn't,' said Gerald; 'you were in your Princess-clothes then. 'What Princess-clothes?' said Mabel, opening her dark eyes very wide. 'Oh, don't be silly,' said Gerald wearily. 'I'm not silly,' said Mabel; 'and I think it's time you went. I'm sure Jimmy wants his tea.' 'Of course I do,' said Jimmy. 'But you had got the Princess-clothes that day. Come along; let's shut up the shutters and leave the ring in its long home.' 'What ring?' said Mabel. 'Don't take any notice of her,' said Gerald. 'She's only trying to be funny.' 'No, I'm not,' said Mabel; 'but I'm inspired like a Python or a Sibylline lady. What ring?' 'The wishing-ring,' said Kathleen; 'the invisibility ring.' 'Don't you see now,' said Mabel, her eyes wider than ever, 'the ring's what you say it is? That's how it came to make us invisible I just said it. Oh, we can't leave it here, if that's what it is. It isn't stealing, really, when it's as valuable as that, you see. Say what it is. 'It's a wishing-ring,' said Jimmy. 'We've had that before and you had your silly wish,' said Mabel, more and more excited. 'I say it isn't a wishing-ring. I say it's a ring that makes the wearer four yards high.' She had caught up the ring as she spoke, and even as she spoke the ring showed high above the children's heads on the finger of an impossible Mabel, who was, indeed, twelve feet high. 'Now you've done it!' said Gerald and he was right. It was in vain that Mabel asserted that the ring was a wishing-ring. It quite clearly wasn't; it was what she had said it was. 'And you can't tell at all how long the effect will last,' said Gerald. 'Look at the invisibleness.' This is difficult to do, but the others understood him. 'It may last for days,' said Kathleen. 'Oh, Mabel, it was silly of you!' 'That's right, rub it in,' said Mabel bitterly; 'you should have believed me when I said it was what I said it was. Then I shouldn't have had to show you, and I shouldn't be this silly size. What am I to do now, I should like to know?' 'We must conceal you till you get your right size again that's all,' said Gerald practically. 'Yes but where?' said Mabel, stamping a foot twenty-four inches long. 'In one of the empty rooms. You wouldn't be afraid?' 'Of course not,' said Mabel. 'Oh, I do wish we'd just put the ring back and left it.' 'Well, it wasn't us that didn't,' said Jimmy, with more truth than grammar. 'I shall put it back now,' said Mabel, tugging at it. 'I wouldn't if I were you,' said Gerald thoughtfully. 'You don't want to stay that length, do you? And unless the ring's on your finger when the time's up, I dare say it wouldn't act.' The exalted Mabel sullenly touched the spring. The panels slowly slid into place, and all the bright jewels were hidden. Once more the room was merely eight-sided, panelled, sunlit, and unfurnished. 'Now,' said Mabel, 'where am I to hide? It's a good thing auntie gave me leave to stay the night with you. As it is, one of you will have to stay the night with me. I'm not going to be left alone, the silly height I am.' Height was the right word; Mabel had said 'four yards high' and she was four yards high. But she was hardly any thicker than when her height was four feet seven, and the effect was, as Gerald remarked, 'wonderfully worm-like'. Her clothes had, of course, grown with her, and she looked like a little girl reflected in one of those long bent mirrors at Rosherville Gardens, that make stout people look so happily slender, and slender people so sadly scraggy. She sat down suddenly on the floor, and it was like a four-fold foot-rule folding itself up. 'It's no use sitting there, girl,' said Gerald. 'I'm not sitting here,' retorted Mabel; 'I only got down so as to be able to get through the door. It'll have to be hands and knees through most places for me now, I suppose.' 'Aren't you hungry?' Jimmy asked suddenly. 'I don't know,' said Mabel desolately; 'it's it's such a long way off!' 'Well, I'll scout,' said Gerald; 'if the coast's clear ' 'Look here,' said Mabel, 'I think I'd rather be out of doors till it gets dark.' 'You can't. Someone's certain to see you.' 'Not if I go through the yew-hedge,' said Mabel. 'There's a yew-hedge with a passage along its inside like the box-hedge in The Luck of the Vails. 'In what?' 'The Luck of the Vails. It's a ripping book. It was that book first set me on to hunt for hidden doors in panels and things. If I crept along that on my front, like a serpent it comes out amongst the rhododendrons, close by the dinosaurus we could camp there. 'There's tea,' said Gerald, who had had no dinner. 'That's just what there isn't,' said Jimmy, who had had none either. 'Oh, you won't desert me!' said Mabel. 'Look here I'll write to auntie. She'll give you the things for a picnic, if she's there and awake. If she isn't, one of the maids will.' So she wrote on a leaf of Gerald's invaluable pocketbook: 'DEAREST AUNTIE Please may we have some things for a picnic? Gerald will bring them. I would come myself, but I am a little tired. I think I have been growing rather fast. Your loving niece, MABEL.' 'P.S. Lots, please, because some of us are very hungry.' It was found difficult, but possible, for Mabel to creep along the tunnel in the yew-hedge. Possible, but slow, so that the three had hardly had time to settle themselves among the rhododendrons and to wonder bitterly what on earth Gerald was up to, to be such a time gone, when he returned, panting under the weight of a covered basket. He dumped it down on the fine grass carpet, groaned, and added, 'But it's worth it. Where's our Mabel?' The long, pale face of Mabel peered out from rhododendron leaves, very near the ground. 'I look just like anybody else like this, don't I?' she asked anxiously; 'all the rest of me's miles away, under different bushes.' 'We've covered up the bits between the bushes with bracken and leaves,' said Kathleen, avoiding the question; 'don't wriggle, Mabel, or you'll waggle them off.' Jimmy was eagerly unpacking the basket. It was a generous tea. A long loaf, butter in a cabbage-leaf, a bottle of milk, a bottle of water, cake, and large, smooth, yellow gooseberries in a box that had once held an extra-sized bottle of somebody's matchless something for the hair and moustache. Mabel cautiously advanced her incredible arms from the rhododendron and leaned on one of her spindly elbows, Gerald cut bread and butter, while Kathleen obligingly ran round, at Mabel's request, to see that the green coverings had not dropped from any of the remoter parts of Mabel's person. Then there was a happy, hungry silence, broken only by those brief, impassioned suggestions natural to such an occasion: 'More cake, please.' 'Milk ahoy, there.' 'Chuck us the goosegogs.' Everyone grew calmer more contented with their lot. A pleasant feeling, half tiredness and half restfulness, crept to the extremities of the party. Even the unfortunate Mabel was conscious of it in her remote feet, that lay crossed under the third rhododendron to the north-north-west of the tea-party. Gerald did but voice the feelings of the others when he said, not without regret: 'Well, I'm a new man, but I couldn't eat so much as another goosegog if you paid me.' 'I could,' said Mabel; 'yes, I know they re all gone, and I've had my share. But I could. It's me being so long, I suppose.' A delicious after-food peace filled the summer air. At a little distance the green-lichened grey of the vast stone dinosaurus showed through the shrubs. He, too, seemed peaceful and happy. Gerald caught his stone eye through a gap in the foliage. His glance seemed somehow sympathetic. 'I dare say he liked a good meal in his day,' said Gerald, stretching luxuriously. 'Who did?' 'The dino what s-his-name,' said Gerald. 'He had a meal today,' said Kathleen, and giggled. 'Yes didn't he?' said Mabel, giggling also. 'You mustn't laugh lower than your chest,' said Kathleen anxiously, 'or your green stuff will joggle off.' 'What do you mean a meal?' Jimmy asked suspiciously. 'What are you sniggering about?' 'He had a meal. Things to put in his inside,' said Kathleen, still giggling. 'Oh, be funny if you want to,' said Jimmy, suddenly cross. 'We don't want to know do we, Jerry?' 'I do,' said Gerald witheringly; 'I'm dying to know. Wake me, you girls, when you've finished pretending you're not going to tell.' He tilted his hat over his eyes, and lay back in the attitude of slumber. 'Oh, don't be stupid!' said Kathleen hastily. 'It's only that we fed the dinosaurus through the hole in his stomach with the clothes the Ugly-Wuglies were made of!' 'We can take them home with us, then,' said Gerald, chewing the white end of a grass stalk, 'so that's all right.' 'Look here,' said Kathleen suddenly; 'I've got an idea. Let me have the ring a bit. I won't say what the idea is, in case it doesn't come off, and then you'd say I was silly. I'll give it back before we go.' 'Oh, but you aren't going yet!' said Mabel, pleading. She pulled off the ring. 'Of course, she added earnestly, 'I'm only too glad for you to try any idea, however silly it is.' Now, Kathleen's idea was quite simple. It was only that perhaps the ring would change its powers if someone else renamed it someone who was not under the power of its enchantment. So the moment it had passed from the long, pale hand of Mabel to one of her own fat, warm, red paws, she jumped up, crying, 'Let's go and empty the dinosaurus now, and started to run swiftly towards that prehistoric monster. She had a good start. She wanted to say aloud, yet so that the others could not hear her, 'This is a wishing-ring. It gives you any wish you choose. And she did say it. And no one heard her, except the birds and a squirrel or two, and perhaps a stone faun, whose pretty face seemed to turn a laughing look on her as she raced past its pedestal. The way was uphill; it was sunny, and Kathleen had run her hardest, though her brothers caught her up before she reached the great black shadow of the dinosaurus. So that when she did reach that shadow she was very hot indeed and not in any state to decide calmly on the best wish to ask for. 'I'll get up and move the things down, because I know exactly where I put them,' she said. Gerald made a back, Jimmy assisted her to climb up, and she disappeared through the hole into the dark inside of the monster. In a moment a shower began to descend from the opening a shower of empty waistcoats, trousers with wildly waving legs, and coats with sleeves uncontrolled. 'Heads below!' called Kathleen, and down came walking-sticks and golf-sticks and hockey-sticks and broom-sticks, rattling and chattering to each other as they came. 'Come on,' said Jimmy. 'Hold on a bit,' said Gerald. 'I'm coming up. He caught the edge of the hole above in his hands and jumped. Just as he got his shoulders through the opening and his knees on the edge he heard Kathleen's boots on the floor of the dinosaurus's inside, and Kathleen's voice saying: 'Isn't it jolly cool in here? I suppose statues are always cool. I do wish I was a statue. Oh!' The 'oh' was a cry of horror and anguish. And it seemed to be cut off very short by a dreadful stony silence. 'What's up?' Gerald asked. But in his heart he knew. He climbed up into the great hollow. In the little light that came up through the hole he could see something white against the grey of the creature's sides. He felt in his pockets, still kneeling, struck a match, and when the blue of its flame changed to clear yellow he looked up to see what he had known he would see the face of Kathleen, white, stony, and lifeless. Her hair was white, too, and her hands, clothes, shoes everything was white, with the hard, cold whiteness of marble. Kathleen had her wish: she was a statue. There was a long moment of perfect stillness in the inside of the dinosaurus. Gerald could not speak. It was too sudden, too terrible. It was worse than anything that had happened yet. Then he turned and spoke down out of that cold, stony silence to Jimmy, in the green, sunny, rustling, live world outside. 'Jimmy, he said, in tones perfectly ordinary and matter of fact, 'Kathleen's gone and said that ring was a wishing-ring. And so it was, of course. I see now what she was up to, running like that. And then the young duffer went and wished she was a statue.' 'And she is?' asked Jimmy, below. 'Come up and have a look,' said Gerald. And Jimmy came, partly with a pull from Gerald and partly with a jump of his own. 'She's a statue, right enough,' he said, in awestruck tones. 'Isn't it awful!' 'Not at all,' said Gerald firmly. 'Come on let's go and tell Mabel.' To Mabel, therefore, who had discreetly remained with her long length screened by rhododendrons, the two boys returned and broke the news. They broke it as one breaks a bottle with a pistol-shot. 'Oh, my goodness!' said Mabel, and writhed through her long length so that the leaves and fern tumbled off in little showers, and she felt the sun suddenly hot on the backs of her legs. 'What next? Oh, my goodness!' 'She'll come all right,' said Gerald, with outward calm. 'Yes; but what about me?' Mabel urged. 'I haven't got the ring. And my time will be up before hers is. Couldn't you get it back? Can't you get it off her hand? I'd put it back on her hand the very minute I was my right size again faithfully I would.' 'Well, it's nothing to blub about,' said Jimmy, answering the sniffs that had served her in this speech for commas and full-stops; 'not for you, anyway.' 'Ah! you don't know,' said Mabel; 'you don't know what it is to be as long as I am. Do do try and get the ring. After all, it is my ring more than any of the rest of yours, anyhow, because I did find it, and I did say it was magic.' The sense of justice always present in the breast of Gerald awoke to this appeal. 'I expect the ring's turned to stone her boots have, and all her clothes. But I'll go and see. Only if I can't, I can't, and it's no use your making a silly fuss.' The first match lighted inside the dinosaurus showed the ring dark on the white hand of the statuesque Kathleen. The fingers were stretched straight out. Gerald took hold of the ring, and, to his surprise, it slipped easily off the cold, smooth marble finger. 'I say, Cathy, old girl, I am sorry,' he said, and gave the marble hand a squeeze. Then it came to him that perhaps she could hear him. So he told the statue exactly what he and the others meant to do. This helped to clear up his ideas as to what he and the others did mean to do. So that when, after thumping the statue hearteningly on its marble back, he returned to the rhododendrons, he was able to give his orders with the clear precision of a born leader, as he later said. And since the others had, neither of them, thought of any plans, his plan was accepted, as the plans of born leaders are apt to be. 'Here's your precious ring,' he said to Mabel. 'Now you're not frightened of anything, are you?' 'No,' said Mabel, in surprise. 'I'd forgotten that. Look here, I'll stay here or farther up in the wood if you'll leave me all the coats, so that I shan't be cold in the night. Then I shall be here when Kathleen comes out of the stone again.' 'Yes,' said Gerald, 'that was exactly the born leader's idea. 'You two go home and tell Mademoiselle that Kathleen's staying at the Towers. She is.' 'Yes,' said Jimmy, 'she certainly is.' 'The magic goes in seven-hour lots,' said Gerald; 'your invisibility was twenty-one hours, mine fourteen, Eliza's seven. When it was a wishing-ring it began with seven. But there's no knowing what number it will be really. So there's no knowing which of you will come right first. Anyhow, we'll sneak out by the cistern window and come down the trellis, after we've said good night to Mademoiselle, and come and have a look at you before we go to bed. I think you'd better come close up to the dinosaurus and we'll leaf you over before we go.' Mabel crawled into cover of the taller trees, and there stood up looking as slender as a poplar and as unreal as the wrong answer to a sum in long division. It was to her an easy matter to crouch beneath the dinosaurus, to put her head up through the opening, and thus to behold the white form of Kathleen. 'It's all right, dear,' she told the stone image; 'I shall be quite close to you. You call me as soon as you feel you're coming right again.' The statue remained motionless, as statues usually do, and Mabel withdrew her head, lay down, was covered up, and left. The boys went home. It was the only reasonable thing to do. It would never have done for Mademoiselle to become anxious and set the police on their track. Everyone felt that. The shock of discovering the missing Kathleen, not only in a dinosaurus's stomach, but, further, in a stone statue of herself, might well have unhinged the mind of any constable, to say nothing of the mind of Mademoiselle, which, being foreign, would necessarily be a mind more light and easy to upset. While as for Mabel 'Well, to look at her as she is now,' said Gerald, 'why, it would send any one off their chump except us.' 'We're different, said Jimmy; 'our chumps have had to jolly well get used to things. It would take a lot to upset us now.' 'Poor old Cathy! all the same,' said Gerald. 'Yes, of course,' said Jimmy. The sun had died away behind the black trees and the moon was rising. Mabel, her preposterous length covered with coats, waistcoats, and trousers laid along it, slept peacefully in the chill of the evening. Inside the dinosaurus Kathleen, alive in her marble, slept too. She had heard Gerald's words had seen the lighted matches. She was Kathleen just the same as ever only she was Kathleen in a case of marble that would not let her move. It would not have let her cry, even if she wanted to. But she had not wanted to cry. Inside, the marble was not cold or hard. It seemed, somehow, to be softly lined with warmth and pleasantness and safety. Her back did not ache with stooping. Her limbs were not stiff with the hours that they had stayed moveless. Everything was well better than well. One had only to wait quietly and quite comfortably and one would come out of this stone case, and once more be the Kathleen one had always been used to being. So she waited happily and calmly, and presently waiting changed to not waiting to not anything; and, close held in the soft inwardness of the marble, she slept as peacefully and calmly as though she had been lying in her own bed. She was awakened by the fact that she was not lying in her own bed was not, indeed, lying at all by the fact that she was standing and that her feet had pins and needles in them. Her arms, too, held out in that odd way, were stiff and tired. She rubbed her eyes, yawned, and remembered. She had been a statue a statue inside the stone dinosaurus. 'Now I'm alive again,' was her instant conclusion, 'and I'll get out of it.' She sat down, put her feet through the hole that showed faintly grey in the stone beast's underside, and as she did so a long, slow lurch threw her sideways on the stone where she sat. The dinosaurus was moving! 'Oh!' said Kathleen inside it, 'how dreadful! It must be moonlight, and it's come alive, like Gerald said. It was indeed moving. She could see through the hole the changing surface of grass and bracken and moss as it waddled heavily along. She dared not drop through the hole while it moved, for fear it should crush her to death with its gigantic feet. And with that thought came another: where was Mabel? Somewhere somewhere near? Suppose one of the great feet planted itself on some part of Mabel's inconvenient length? Mabel being the size she was now it would be quite difficult not to step on some part or other of her, if she should happen to be in one's way quite difficult, however much one tried. And the dinosaurus would not try: Why should it? Kathleen hung in an agony over the round opening. The huge beast swung from side to side. It was going faster; it was no good, she dared not jump out. Anyhow, they must be quite away from Mabel by now. Faster and faster went the dinosaurus. The floor of its stomach sloped. They were going downhill. Twigs cracked and broke as it pushed through a belt of evergreen oaks; gravel crunched, ground beneath its stony feet. Then stone met stone. There was a pause. A splash! They were close to water the lake where by moonlight Hermes fluttered and Janus and the dinosaurus swam together. Kathleen dropped swiftly through the hole on to the flat marble that edged the basin, rushed sideways, and stood panting in the shadow of a statue's pedestal. Not a moment too soon, for even as she crouched the monster lizard slipped heavily into the water, drowning a thousand smooth, shining lily pads, and swam away towards the central island. 'Be still, little lady. I leap!' The voice came from the pedestal, and next moment Phoebus had jumped from the pedestal in his little temple, clearing the steps, and landing a couple of yards away. 'You are new,' said Phoebus over his graceful shoulder. 'I should not have forgotten you if once I had seen you.' 'I am,' said Kathleen, 'quite, quite new. And I didn't know you could talk.' 'Why not?' Phoebus laughed. 'You can talk.' 'But I'm alive.' 'Am not I?' he asked. 'Oh, yes, I suppose so,' said Kathleen, distracted, but not afraid; 'only I thought you had to have the ring on before one could even see you move.' Phoebus seemed to understand her, which was rather to his credit, for she had certainly not expressed herself with clearness. 'Ah! that's for mortals,' he said. 'We can hear and see each other in the few moments when life is ours. That is a part of the beautiful enchantment.' 'But I am a mortal,' said Kathleen. 'You are as modest as you are charming,' said Phoebus Apollo absently; 'the white water calls me! I go,' and the next moment rings of liquid silver spread across the lake, widening and widening, from the spot where the white joined hands of the Sun-god had struck the water as he dived. Kathleen turned and went up the hill towards the rhododendron bushes. She must find Mabel, and they must go home at once. If only Mabel was of a size that one could conveniently take home with one! Most likely, at this hour of enchantments, she was. Kathleen, heartened by the thought, hurried on. She passed through the rhododendron bushes, remembered the pointed painted paper face that had looked out from the glossy leaves, expected to be frightened  and wasn't. She found Mabel easily enough, and much more easily than she would have done had Mabel been as she wished to find her. For quite a long way off in the moonlight, she could see that long and worm-like form, extended to its full twelve feet and covered with coats and trousers and waistcoats. Mabel looked like a drain-pipe that has been covered in sacks in frosty weather. Kathleen touched her long cheek gently, and she woke. 'What's up?' she said sleepily. 'It's only me,' Kathleen explained. 'How cold your hands are!' said Mabel. 'Wake up,' said Kathleen, 'and let's talk.' 'Can't we go home now? I'm awfully tired, and it's so long since tea-time.' 'You're too long to go home yet,' said Kathleen sadly, and then Mabel remembered. She lay with closed eyes then suddenly she stirred and cried out: 'Oh! Cathy, I feel so funny like one of those horn snakes when you make it go short to get it into its box. I am yes I know I am ' She was; and Kathleen, watching her, agreed that it was exactly like the shortening of a horn spiral snake between the closing hands of a child. Mabel's distant feet drew near Mabel's long, lean arms grew shorter Mabel's face was no longer half a yard long. 'You're coming right you are! Oh, I am so glad!' cried Kathleen. 'I know I am,' said Mabel; and as she said it she became once more Mabel, not only in herself which, of course, she had been all the time, but in her outward appearance. 'You are all right. Oh, hooray! hooray! I am so glad!' said Kathleen kindly; 'and now we'll go home at once, dear.' 'Go home?' said Mabel, slowly sitting up and staring at Kathleen with her big dark eyes. 'Go home like that?' 'Like what?' Kathleen asked impatiently. 'Why, you,' was Mabel's odd reply. 'I'm all right,' said Kathleen. 'Come on.' 'Do you mean to say you don't know?' said Mabel. 'Look at yourself your hands your dress everything.' Kathleen looked at her hands. They were of marble whiteness. Her dress, too her shoes, her stockings, even the ends of her hair. She was white as new-fallen snow. 'What is it?' she asked, beginning to tremble. 'What am I all this horrid colour for?' 'Don't you see? Oh, Cathy, don't you see? You've not come right. You're a statue still.' 'I'm not I'm alive I'm talking to you.' 'I know you are, darling,' said Mabel, soothing her as one soothes a fractious child. 'That's because it's moonlight.' 'But you can see I'm alive.' 'Of course I can. I've got the ring.' 'But I'm all right; I know I am.' 'Don't you see,' said Mabel gently, taking her white marble hand, 'you're not all right? It's moonlight, and you're a statue, and you've just come alive with all the other statues. And when the moon goes down you'll just be a statue again. That's the difficulty, dear, about our going home again. You're just a statue still, only you've come alive with the other marble things. Where's the dinosaurus?' 'In his bath,' said Kathleen, 'and so are all the other stone beasts.' Well,' said Mabel, trying to look on the bright side of things, 'then we've got one thing, at any rate, to be thankful for!' 'If,' said Kathleen, sitting disconsolate in her marble, 'if I am really a statue come alive, I wonder you're not afraid of me.' 'I've got the ring,' said Mabel with decision. 'Cheer up, dear! you will soon be better. Try not to think about it.' She spoke as you speak to a child that has cut its finger, or fallen down on the garden path, and rises up with grazed knees to which gravel sticks intimately. 'I know,' Kathleen absently answered. 'And I've been thinking,' said Mabel brightly, 'we might find Out a lot about this magic place, if the other statues aren't too proud to talk to us.' 'They aren't,' Kathleen assured her; 'at least, Phoebus wasn't. He was most awfully polite and nice.' 'Where is he?' Mabel asked. 'In the lake he was,' said Kathleen. 'Then let's go down there,' said Mabel. 'Oh, Cathy! it is jolly being your own proper thickness again.' She jumped up, and the withered ferns and branches that had covered her long length and had been gathered closely upon her as she shrank to her proper size fell as forest leaves do when sudden storms tear them. But the white Kathleen did not move. The two sat on the grey moonlit grass with the quiet of the night all about them. The great park was still as a painted picture; only the splash of the fountains and the far-off whistle of the Western express broke the silence, which, at the same time, then deepened. 'What cheer, little sister!' said a voice behind them a golden voice. They turned quick, startled heads, as birds, surprised, might turn. There in the moonlight stood Phoebus, dripping still from the lake, and smiling at them, very gentle, very friendly. 'Oh, it's you!' said Kathleen. 'None other,' said Phoebus cheerfully. 'Who is your friend, the earth-child?' 'This is Mabel,' said Kathleen. Mabel got up and bowed, hesitated, and held out a hand. 'I am your slave, little lady,' said Phoebus, enclosing it in marble fingers. 'But I fail to understand how you can see us, and why you do not fear.' Mabel held up the hand that wore the ring. 'Quite sufficient explanation,' said Phoebus; 'but since you have that, why retain your mottled earthy appearance? Become a statue, and swim with us in the lake.' 'I can't swim,' said Mabel evasively. 'Nor yet me,' said Kathleen. 'You can,' said Phoebus. 'All statues that come to life are proficient in all athletic exercises. And you, child of the dark eyes and hair like night, wish yourself a statue and join our revels.' 'I'd rather not, if you will excuse me,' said Mabel cautiously. 'You see ... this ring ... you wish for things, and you never know how long they're going to last. It would be jolly and all that to be a statue now, but in the morning I should wish I hadn't.' 'Earth-folk often do, they say,' mused Phoebus. 'But, child, you seem ignorant of the powers of your ring. Wish exactly, and the ring will exactly perform. If you give no limit of time, strange enchantments woven by Arithmos the outcast god of numbers will creep in and spoil the spell. Say thus: 'I wish that till the dawn I may be a statue of living marble, even as my child friend, and that after that time I may be as before Mabel of the dark eyes and night-coloured hair.' 'Oh, yes, do, it would be so jolly!' cried Kathleen. 'Do, Mabel! And if we're both statues, shall we be afraid of the dinosaurus?' 'In the world of living marble fear is not,' said Phoebus. 'Are we not brothers, we and the dinosaurus brethren alike wrought of stone and life?' 'And could I swim if I did?' 'Swim, and float, and dive and with the ladies of Olympus spread the nightly feast, eat of the food of the gods, drink their cup, listen to the song that is undying, and catch the laughter of immortal lips.' 'A feast!' said Kathleen. 'Oh, Mabel, do! You would if you were as hungry as I am.' 'But it won't be real food,' urged Mabel. 'It will be real to you, as to us,' said Phoebus; 'there is no other realness even in your many-coloured world.' Still Mabel hesitated. Then she looked at Kathleen's legs and suddenly said: 'Very well, I will. But first I'll take off my shoes and stockings. Marble boots look simply awful especially the laces. And a marble stocking that's coming down and mine do!' She had pulled off shoes and stockings and pinafore. 'Mabel has the sense of beauty,' said Phoebus approvingly. 'Speak the spell, child, and I will lead you to the ladies of Olympus.' Mabel, trembling a little, spoke it, and there were two little live statues in the moonlit glade. Tall Phoebus took a hand of each. 'Come run!' he cried. And they ran. 'Oh it is jolly!' Mabel panted. 'Look at my white feet in the grass! I thought it would feel stiff to be a statue, but it doesn't.' 'There is no stiffness about the immortals,' laughed the Sun-god. 'For tonight you are one of us.' And with that they ran down the slope to the lake. 'Jump!' he cried, and they jumped, and the water splashed up round three white, gleaming shapes. 'Oh! I can swim!' breathed Kathleen. 'So can I,' said Mabel. 'Of course you can,' said Phoebus. 'Now three times round the lake, and then make for the island.' Side by side the three swam, Phoebus swimming gently to keep pace with the children. Their marble clothes did not seem to interfere at all with their swimming, as your clothes would if you suddenly jumped into the basin of the Trafalgar Square fountains and tried to swim there. And they swam most beautifully, with that perfect ease and absence of effort or tiredness which you must have noticed about your own swimming in dreams. And it was the most lovely place to swim in; the water-lilies, whose long, snaky stalks are so inconvenient to ordinary swimmers, did not in the least interfere with the movements of marble arms and legs. The moon was high in the clear sky-dome. The weeping willows, cypresses, temples, terraces, banks of trees and shrubs, and the wonderful old house, all added to the romantic charm of the scene. 'This is the nicest thing the ring has brought us yet,' said Mabel, through a languid but perfect side-stroke. 'I thought you'd enjoy it,' said Phoebus kindly; 'now once more round, and then the island.' They landed on the island amid a fringe of rushes, yarrow, willow-herb, loose-strife, and a few late, scented, powdery, creamy heads of meadow-sweet. The island was bigger than it looked from the bank, and it seemed covered with trees and shrubs. But when, Phoebus leading the way, they went into the shadow of these, they perceived that beyond the trees lay a light, much nearer to them than the other side of the island could possibly be. And almost at once they were through the belt of trees, and could see where the light came from. The trees they had just passed among made a dark circle round a big cleared space, standing up thick and dark, like a crowd round a football field, as Kathleen remarked. First came a wide, smooth ring of lawn, then marble steps going down to a round pool, where there were no water-lilies, only gold and silver fish that darted here and there like flashes of quicksilver and dark flames. And the enclosed space of water and marble and grass was lighted with a clear, white, radiant light, seven times stronger than the whitest moonlight, and in the still waters of the pool seven moons lay reflected. One could see that they were only reflections by the way their shape broke and changed as the gold and silver fish rippled the water with moving fin and tail that steered. The girls looked up at the sky, almost expecting to see seven moons there. But no, the old moon shone alone, as she had always shone on them. 'There are seven moons,' said Mabel blankly, and pointed, which is not manners. 'Of course,' said Phoebus kindly; 'everything in our world is seven times as much so as in yours.' 'But there aren't seven of you,' said Mabel. 'No, but I am seven times as much,' said the Sun-god. 'You see, there's numbers, and there's quantity, to say nothing of quality. You see that, I'm sure.' 'Not quite,' said Kathleen. 'Explanations always weary me,' Phoebus interrupted. 'Shall we join the ladies?' On the further side of the pool was a large group, so white that it seemed to make a great white hole in the trees. Some twenty or thirty figures there were in the group all statues and all alive. Some were dipping their white feet among the gold and silver fish, and sending ripples across the faces of the seven moons. Some were pelting each other with roses roses so sweet that the girls could smell them even across the pool. Others were holding hands and dancing in a ring, and two were sitting on the steps playing cat's-cradle which is a very ancient game indeed  with a thread of white marble. As the new-comers advanced a shout of greeting and gay laughter went up. 'Late again, Phoebus!' someone called out. And another: 'Did one of your horses cast a shoe?' And yet another called out something about laurels. 'I bring two guests,' said Phoebus, and instantly the statues crowded round, stroking the girls hair, patting their cheeks, and calling them the prettiest love-names. 'Are the wreaths ready, Hebe?' the tallest and most splendid of the ladies called out. 'Make two more!' And almost directly Hebe came down the steps, her round arms hung thick with rose-wreaths. There was one for each marble head. Everyone now looked seven times more beautiful than before, which, in the case of the gods and goddesses, is saying a good deal. The children remembered how at the raspberry vinegar feast Mademoiselle had said that gods and goddesses always wore wreaths for meals. Hebe herself arranged the roses on the girls heads  and Aphrodite Urania, the dearest lady in the world, with a voice like mother's at those moments when you love her most, took them by the hands and said: 'Come, we must get the feast ready. Eros Psyche Hebe Ganymede all you young people can arrange the fruit.' 'I don't see any fruit,' said Kathleen, as four slender forms disengaged themselves from the white crowd and came towards them. 'You will though,' said Eros, a really nice boy, as the girls instantly agreed; 'you've only got to pick it.' 'Like this,' said Psyche, lifting her marble arms to a willow branch. She reached out her hand to the children it held a ripe pomegranate. 'I see,' said Mabel. 'You just ' She laid her fingers to the willow branch and the firm softness of a big peach was within them. 'Yes, just that,' laughed Psyche, who was a darling, as any one could see. After this Hebe gathered a few silver baskets from a convenient alder, and the four picked fruit industriously. Meanwhile the elder statues were busy plucking golden goblets and jugs and dishes from the branches of ash-trees and young oaks and filling them with everything nice to eat and drink that anyone could possibly want, and these were spread on the steps. It was a celestial picnic. Then everyone sat or lay down and the feast began. And oh! the taste of the food served on those dishes, the sweet wonder of the drink that melted from those gold cups on the white lips of the company! And the fruit there is no fruit like it grown on earth, just as there is no laughter like the laughter of those lips, no songs like the songs that stirred the silence of that night of wonder. 'Oh!' cried Kathleen, and through her fingers the juice of her third peach fell like tears on the marble steps. 'I do wish the boys were here!' 'I do wonder what they're doing,' said Mabel. 'At this moment,' said Hermes, who had just made a wide ring of flight, as a pigeon does, and come back into the circle  'at this moment they are wandering desolately near the home of the dinosaurus, having escaped from their home by a window, in search of you. They fear that you have perished, and they would weep if they did not know that tears do not become a man, however youthful.' Kathleen stood up and brushed the crumbs of ambrosia from her marble lap. 'Thank you all very much, she said. 'It was very kind of you to have us, and we've enjoyed ourselves very much, but I think we ought to go now, please. 'If it is anxiety about your brothers,' said Phoebus obligingly, 'it is the easiest thing in the world for them to join you. Lend me your ring a moment.' He took it from Kathleen's half-reluctant hand, dipped it in the reflection of one of the seven moons, and gave it back. She clutched it. 'Now,' said the Sun-god, 'wish for them that which Mabel wished for herself. Say ' 'I know,' Kathleen interrupted. 'I wish that the boys may be statues of living marble like Mabel and me till dawn, and afterwards be like they are now.' 'If you hadn't interrupted,' said Phoebus 'but there, we can't expect old heads on shoulders of young marble. You should have wished them here and but no matter. Hermes, old chap, cut across and fetch them, and explain things as you come.' He dipped the ring again in one of the reflected moons before he gave it back to Kathleen. 'There,' he said, 'now it's washed clean ready for the next magic.' 'It is not our custom to question guests,' said Hera the queen, turning her great eyes on the children; 'but that ring excites, I am sure, the interest of us all.' 'It is the ring,' said Phoebus. 'That, of course,' said Hera; 'but if it were not inhospitable to ask questions I should ask, How came it into the hands of these earth-children?' 'That,' said Phoebus, 'is a long tale. After the feast the story, and after the story the song.' Hermes seemed to have 'explained everything' quite fully; for when Gerald and Jimmy in marble whiteness arrived, each clinging to one of the god's winged feet, and so borne through the air, they were certainly quite at ease. They made their best bows to the goddesses and took their places as unembarrassed as though they had had Olympian suppers every night of their lives. Hebe had woven wreaths of roses ready for them, and as Kathleen watched them eating and drinking, perfectly at home in their marble, she was very glad that amid the welling springs of immortal peach-juice she had not forgotten her brothers. 'And now,' said Hera, when the boys had been supplied with everything they could possibly desire, and more than they could eat 'now for the story.' 'Yes,' said Mabel intensely; and Kathleen said, 'Oh yes; now for the story. How splendid!' 'The story,' said Phoebus unexpectedly, 'will be told by our guests.' 'Oh no!' said Kathleen, shrinking. 'The lads, maybe, are bolder,' said Zeus the king, taking off his rose-wreath, which was a little tight, and rubbing his compressed ears. 'I really can't,' said Gerald; 'besides, I don't know any stories.' 'Nor yet me,' said Jimmy. 'It's the story of how we got the ring that they want,' said Mabel in a hurry. 'I'll tell it if you like, Once upon a time there was a little girl called Mabel,' she added yet more hastily, and went on with the tale all the tale of the enchanted castle, or almost all, that you have read in these pages. The marble Olympians listened enchanted almost as enchanted as the castle itself, and the soft moonlit moments fell past like pearls dropping into a deep pool. 'And so,' Mabel ended abruptly, 'Kathleen wished for the boys and the Lord Hermes fetched them and here we all are.' A burst of interested comment and question blossomed out round the end of the story, suddenly broken off short by Mabel. 'But,' said she, brushing it aside, as it grew thinner, 'now we want you to tell us.' 'To tell you ?' 'How you come to be alive, and how you know about the ring and everything you do know.' 'Everything I know?' Phoebus laughed it was to him that she had spoken and not his lips only but all the white lips curled in laughter. 'The span of your life, my earth-child, would not contain the words I should speak, to tell you all I know.' 'Well, about the ring anyhow, and how you come alive,' said Gerald; 'you see, it's very puzzling to us.' 'Tell them, Phoebus,' said the dearest lady in the world; 'don't tease the children.' So Phoebus, leaning back against a heap of leopard- skins that Dionysus had lavishly plucked from a spruce fir, told. 'All statues,' he said, 'can come alive when the moon shines, if they so choose. But statues that are placed in ugly cities do not choose. Why should they weary themselves with the contemplation of the hideous?' 'Quite so,' said Gerald politely, to fill the pause. 'In your beautiful temples,' the Sun-god went on, 'the images of your priests and of your warriors who lie cross-legged on their tombs come alive and walk in their marble about their temples, and through the woods and fields. But only on one night in all the year can any see them. You have beheld us because you held the ring, and are of one brotherhood with us in your marble, but on that one night all may behold us.' 'And when is that?' Gerald asked, again polite, in a pause. 'At the festival of the harvest,' said Phoebes. 'On that night as the moon rises it strikes one beam of perfect light on to the altar in certain temples. One of these temples is in Hellas, buried under the fall of a mountain which Zeus, being angry, hurled down upon it. One is in this land; it is in this great garden.' 'Then,' said Gerald, much interested, 'if we were to come up to that temple on that night, we could see you, even without being statues or having the ring?' 'Even so,' said Phoebus. 'More, any question asked by a mortal we are on that night bound to answer.' 'And the night is when?' 'Ah!' said Phoebus, and laughed. 'Wouldn't you like to know!' Then the great marble King of the Gods yawned, stroked his long beard, and said: 'Enough of stories, Phoebus. Tune your lyre.' 'But the ring,' said Mabel in a whisper, as the Sun-god tuned the white strings of a sort of marble harp that lay at his feet 'about how you know all about the ring?' 'Presently,' the Sun-god whispered back. 'Zeus must be obeyed; but ask me again before dawn, and I will tell you all I know of it.' Mabel drew back, and leaned against the comfortable knees of one Demeter Kathleen and Psyche sat holding hands. Gerald and Jimmy lay at full length, chins on elbows, gazing at the Sun-god; and even as he held the lyre, before ever his fingers began to sweep the strings, the spirit of music hung in the air, enchanting, enslaving, silencing all thought but the thought of itself, all desire but the desire to listen to it. Then Phoebus struck the strings and softly plucked melody from them, and all the beautiful dreams of all the world came fluttering close with wings like doves wings; and all the lovely thoughts that sometimes hover near, but not so near that you can catch them, now came home as to their nests in the hearts of those who listened. And those who listened forgot time and space, and how to be sad, and how to be naughty, and it seemed that the whole world lay like a magic apple in the hand of each listener, and that the whole world was good and beautiful. And then, suddenly, the spell was shattered. Phoebus struck a broken chord, followed by an instant of silence; then he sprang up, crying, 'The dawn! the dawn! To your pedestals, O gods!' In an instant the whole crowd of beautiful marble people had leaped to its feet, had rushed through the belt of wood that cracked and rustled as they went, and the children heard them splash, in the water beyond. They heard, too, the gurgling breathing of a great beast, and knew that the dinosaurus, too, was returning to his own place. Only Hermes had time, since one flies more swiftly than one swims, to hover above them for one moment, and to whisper with a mischievous laugh: 'In fourteen days from now, at the Temple of Strange Stones.' 'What's the secret of the ring?' gasped Mabel. 'The ring is the heart of the magic,' said Hermes. 'Ask at the moonrise on the fourteenth day, and you shall know all.' With that he waved the snowy caduceus and rose in the air supported by his winged feet. And as he went the seven reflected moons died out and a chill wind began to blow, a grey light grew and grew, the birds stirred and twittered, and the marble slipped away from the children like a skin that shrivels in fire, and they were statues no more, but flesh and blood children as they used to be, standing knee-deep in brambles and long coarse grass. There was no smooth lawn, no marble steps, no seven-mooned fish-pond. The dew lay thick on the grass and the brambles, and it was very cold. 'We ought to have gone with them,' said Mabel with chattering teeth. 'We can't swim now we re not marble. And I suppose this is the island?' It was and they couldn't swim. They knew it. One always knows those sort of things somehow without trying. For instance, you know perfectly that you can't fly. There are some things that there is no mistake about. The dawn grew brighter and the outlook more black every moment. 'There isn't a boat, I suppose?' Jimmy asked. 'No,' said Mabel, 'not on this side of the lake; there's one in the boat-house, of course if you could swim there.' 'You know I can't,' said Jimmy. 'Can't anyone think of anything?' Gerald asked, shivering. 'When they find we've disappeared they'll drag all the water for miles round, said Jimmy hopefully, 'in case we've fallen in and sunk to the bottom. When they come to drag this we can yell and be rescued.' 'Yes, dear, that will be nice,' was Gerald's bitter comment. 'Don't be so disagreeable,' said Mabel with a tone so strangely cheerful that the rest stared at her in amazement. 'The ring,' she said. 'Of course we've only got to wish ourselves home with it. Phoebus washed it in the moon ready for the next wish. 'You didn't tell us about that,' said Gerald in accents of perfect good temper. 'Never mind. Where is the ring?' 'You had it,' Mabel reminded Kathleen. 'I know I had,' said that child in stricken tones, 'but I gave it to Psyche to look at and and she's got it on her finger!' Everyone tried not to be angry with Kathleen. All partly succeeded. 'If we ever get off this beastly island,' said Gerald, 'I suppose you can find Psyche's statue and get it off again?' 'No I can't,' Mabel moaned. 'I don't know where the statue is. I've never seen it. It may be in Hellas, wherever that is or anywhere, for anything I know.' No one had anything kind to say, and it is pleasant to record that nobody said anything. And now it was grey daylight, and the sky to the north was flushing in pale pink and lavender. The boys stood moodily, hands in pockets. Mabel and Kathleen seemed to find it impossible not to cling together, and all about their legs the long grass was icy with dew. A faint sniff and a caught breath broke the silence. 'Now, look here,' said Gerald briskly, 'I won't have it. Do you hear? Snivelling's no good at all. No, I'm not a pig. It's for your own good. Let's make a tour of the island. Perhaps there's a boat hidden somewhere among the overhanging boughs. 'How could there be?' Mabel asked. 'Someone might have left it there, I suppose,' said Gerald. 'But how would they have got off the island?' 'In another boat, of course,' said Gerald; 'come on.' Downheartedly, and quite sure that there wasn't and couldn't be any boat, the four children started to explore the island. How often each one of them had dreamed of islands, how often wished to be stranded on one! Well, now they were. Reality is sometimes quite different from dreams, and not half so nice. It was worst of all for Mabel, whose shoes and stockings were far away on the mainland. The coarse grass and brambles were very cruel to bare legs and feet. They stumbled through the wood to the edge of the water, but it was impossible to keep close to the edge of the island, the branches grew too thickly. There was a narrow, grassy path that wound in and out among the trees, and this they followed, dejected and mournful. Every moment made it less possible for them to hope to get back to the school-house unnoticed. And if they were missed and beds found in their present unslept-in state well, there would be a row of some sort, and, as Gerald said, 'Farewell to liberty!' 'Of course we can get off all right,' said Gerald. 'Just all shout when we see a gardener or a keeper on the mainland. But if we do, concealment is at an end and all is absolutely up!' 'Yes,' said everyone gloomily. 'Come, buck up!' said Gerald, the spirit of the born general beginning to reawaken in him. 'We shall get out of this scrape all right, as we've got out of others; you know we shall. See, the sun's coming out. You feel all right and jolly now, don't you?' 'Yes, oh yes!' said everyone, in tones of unmixed misery. The sun was now risen, and through a deep cleft in the hills it sent a strong shaft of light straight at the island. The yellow light, almost level, struck through the stems of the trees and dazzled the children's eyes. This, with the fact that he was not looking where he was going, as Jimmy did not fail to point out later, was enough to account for what now happened to Gerald, who was leading the melancholy little procession. He stumbled, clutched at a tree-trunk, missed his clutch, and disappeared, with a yell and a clatter; and Mabel, who came next, only pulled herself up just in time not to fall down a steep flight of moss-grown steps that seemed to open suddenly in the ground at her feet. 'Oh, Gerald!' she called down the steps; 'are you hurt?' 'No,' said Gerald, out of sight and crossly, for he was hurt, rather severely; 'it's steps, and there's a passage.' 'There always is,' said Jimmy. 'I knew there was a passage,' said Mabel; 'it goes under the water and comes out at the Temple of Flora. Even the gardeners know that, but they won't go down, for fear of snakes.' 'Then we can get out that way I do think you might have said so,' Gerald's voice came up to say. 'I didn't think of it,' said Mabel. 'At least And I suppose it goes past the place where the Ugly-Wugly found its good hotel.' 'I'm not going,' said Kathleen positively, 'not in the dark, I'm not. So I tell you!' 'Very well, baby,' said Gerald sternly, and his head appeared from below very suddenly through interlacing brambles. 'No one asked you to go in the dark. We'll leave you here if you like, and return and rescue you with a boat. Jimmy, the bicycle lamp!' He reached up a hand for it. Jimmy produced from his bosom, the place where lamps are always kept in fairy stories see Aladdin and others a bicycle lamp. 'We brought it,' he explained, 'so as not to break our shins over bits of long Mabel among the rhododendrons.' 'Now,' said Gerald very firmly, striking a match and opening the thick, rounded glass front of the bicycle lamp, 'I don't know what the rest of you are going to do, but I'm going down these steps and along this passage. If we find the good hotel well, a good hotel never hurt anyone yet.' 'It's no good, you know,' said Jimmy weakly; 'you know jolly well you can't get out of that Temple of Flora door, even if you get to it.' 'I don't know,' said Gerald, still brisk and commander-like; 'there's a secret spring inside that door most likely. We hadn't a lamp last time to look for it, remember.' 'If there's one thing I do hate its undergroundness,' said Mabel. 'You're not a coward,' said Gerald, with what is known as diplomacy. 'You're brave, Mabel. Don't I know it!' You hold Jimmy's hand and I'll hold Cathy s. Now then.' 'I won't have my hand held,' said Jimmy, of course. 'I'm not a kid.' 'Well, Cathy will. Poor little Cathy! Nice brother Jerry'll hold poor Cathy's hand.' Gerald's bitter sarcasm missed fire here, for Cathy gratefully caught the hand he held out in mockery. She was too miserable to read his mood, as she mostly did. 'Oh, thank you, Jerry dear,' she said gratefully; 'you are a dear, and I will try not to be frightened.' And for quite a minute Gerald shamedly felt that he had not been quite, quite kind. So now, leaving the growing goldness of the sunrise, the four went down the stone steps that led to the underground and underwater passage, and everything seemed to grow dark and then to grow into a poor pretence of light again, as the splendour of dawn gave place to the small dogged lighting of the bicycle lamp. The steps did indeed lead to a passage, the beginnings of it choked with the drifted dead leaves of many old autumns. But presently the passage took a turn, there were more steps, down, down, and then the passage was empty and straight lined above and below and on each side with slabs of marble, very clear and clean. Gerald held Cathy's hand with more of kindness and less of exasperation than he had supposed possible. And Cathy, on her part, was surprised to find it possible to be so much less frightened than she expected. The flame of the bull's-eye threw ahead a soft circle of misty light the children followed it silently. Till, silently and suddenly, the light of the bull's-eye behaved as the flame of a candle does when you take it out into the sunlight to light a bonfire, or explode a train of gunpowder, or what not. Because now, with feelings mixed indeed, of wonder, and interest, and awe, but no fear, the children found themselves in a great hail, whose arched roof was held up by two rows of round pillars, and whose every corner was filled with a soft, searching, lovely light, filling every cranny, as water fills the rocky secrecies of hidden sea-caves. 'How beautiful!' Kathleen whispered, breathing hard into the tickled ear of her brother, and Mabel caught the hand of Jimmy and whispered, 'I must hold your hand I must hold on to something silly, or I shan't believe it's real.' For this hall in which the children found themselves was the most beautiful place in the world. I won't describe it, because it does not look the same to any two people, and you wouldn't understand me if I tried to tell you how it looked to any one of these four. But to each it seemed the most perfect thing possible. I will only say that all round it were great arches. Kathleen saw them as Moorish, Mabel as Tudor, Gerald as Norman, and Jimmy as Churchwarden Gothic. (If you don't know what these are, ask your uncle who collects brasses, and he will explain, or perhaps Mr. Millar will draw the different kinds of arches for you.) And through these arches one could see many things oh! but many things. Through one appeared an olive garden, and in it two lovers who held each other's hands, under an Italian moon; through another a wild sea, and a ship to whom the wild, racing sea was slave. A third showed a king on his throne, his courtiers obsequious about him; and yet a fourth showed a really good hotel, with the respectable Ugly-Wugly sunning himself on the front doorsteps. There was a mother, bending over a wooden cradle. There was an artist gazing entranced on the picture his wet brush seemed to have that moment completed, a general dying on a field where Victory had planted the standard he loved, and these things were not pictures, but the truest truths, alive, and, as anyone could see, immortal. Many other pictures there were that these arches framed. And all showed some moment when life had sprung to fire and flower the best that the soul of man could ask or man's destiny grant. And the really good hotel had its place here too, because there are some souls that ask no higher thing of life than 'a really good hotel' . 'Oh, I am glad we came; I am, I am!' Kathleen murmured, and held fast to her brother's hand. They went slowly up the hall, the ineffectual bull's-eye, held by Jimmy, very crooked indeed, showing almost as a shadow in this big, glorious light. And then, when the hall's end was almost reached, the children saw where the light came from. It glowed and spread itself from one place, and in that place stood the one statue that Mabel 'did not know where to find' the statue of Psyche. They went on, slowly, quite happy, quite bewildered. And when they came close to Psyche they saw that on her raised hand the ring showed dark. Gerald let go Kathleen's hand, put his foot on the pediment, his knee on the pedestal. He stood up, dark and human, beside the white girl with the butterfly wings. 'I do hope you don't mind,' he said, and drew the ring off very gently. Then, as he dropped to the ground, 'Not here,' he said. 'I don't know why, but not here.' And they all passed behind the white Psyche, and once more the bicycle lamp seemed suddenly to come to life again as Gerald held it in front of him, to be the pioneer in the dark passage that led from the Hall of but they did not know, then, what it was the Hall of. Then, as the twisting passage shut in on them with a darkness that pressed close against the little light of the bicycle lamp, Kathleen said, 'Give me the ring. I know exactly what to say.' Gerald gave it with not extreme readiness. 'I wish,' said Kathleen slowly, 'that no one at home may know that we've been out tonight, and I wish we were safe in our own beds, undressed, and in our nightgowns, and asleep.' And the next thing any of them knew, it was good, strong, ordinary daylight not just sunrise, but the kind of daylight you are used to being called in, and all were in their own beds. Kathleen had framed the wish most sensibly. The only mistake had been in saying 'in our own beds' because, of course, Mabel's own bed was at Yalding Towers, and to this day Mabel's drab-haired aunt cannot understand how Mabel, who was staying the night with that child in the town she was so taken up with, hadn't come home at eleven, when the aunt locked up, and yet she was in her bed in the morning. For though not a clever woman, she was not stupid enough to be able to believe any one of the eleven fancy explanations which the distracted Mabel offered in the course of the morning. The first (which makes twelve) of these explanations was The Truth, and of course the aunt was far too clever to believe That! It was show-day at Yalding Castle, and it seemed good to the children to go and visit Mabel, and, as Gerald put it, to mingle unsuspected with the crowd; to gloat over all the things which they knew and which the crowd didn't know about the castle and the sliding panels, the magic ring and the statues that came alive. Perhaps one of the pleasantest things about magic happenings is the feeling which they give you of knowing what other people not only don't know but wouldn't, so to speak, believe if they did. On the white road outside the gates of the castle was a dark spattering of breaks and wagonettes and dogcarts. Three or four waiting motor-cars puffed fatly where they stood, and bicycles sprawled in heaps along the grassy hollow by the red brick wall. And the people who had been brought to the castle by the breaks and wagonettes, and dog-carts and bicycles and motors, as well as those who had walked there on their own unaided feet, were scattered about the grounds, or being shown over those parts of the castle which were, on this one day of the week, thrown open to visitors. There were more visitors than usual today because it had somehow been whispered about that Lord Yalding was down, and that the holland covers were to be taken off the state furniture so that a rich American who wished to rent the castle, to live in, might see the place in all its glory. It certainly did look very splendid. The embroidered satin, gilded leather and tapestry of the chairs, which had been hidden by brown holland, gave to the rooms a pleasant air of being lived in. There were flowering plants and pots of roses here and there on tables or window-ledges. Mabel's aunt prided herself on her tasteful touch in the home, and had studied the arrangement of flowers in a series of articles in Home Drivel called 'How to Make Home High-class on Nine-pence a Week'. The great crystal chandeliers, released from the bags that at ordinary times shrouded them, gleamed with grey and purple splendour. The brown linen sheets had been taken off the state beds, and the red ropes that usually kept the low crowd in its proper place had been rolled up and hidden away. 'It's exactly as if we were calling on the family,' said the grocer's daughter from Salisbury to her friend who was in the millinery. 'If the Yankee doesn't take it, what do you say to you and me setting up here when we get spliced?' the draper's assistant asked his sweetheart. And she said: 'Oh, Reggie, how can you! you are too funny.' All the afternoon the crowd in its smart holiday clothes, pink blouses, and light-coloured suits, flowery hats, and scarves beyond description passed through and through the dark hall, the magnificent drawing-rooms and boudoirs and picture-galleries. The chattering crowd was awed into something like quiet by the calm, stately bedchambers, where men had been born, and died; where royal guests had lain in long-ago summer nights, with big bow-pots of elder-flowers set on the hearth to ward off fever and evil spells. The terrace, where in old days dames in ruffs had sniffed the sweet-brier and southern-wood of the borders below, and ladies, bright with rouge and powder and brocade, had walked in the swing of their hooped skirts the terrace now echoed to the sound of brown boots, and the tap-tap of high-heeled shoes at two and eleven three, and high laughter and chattering voices that said nothing that the children wanted to hear. These spoiled for them the quiet of the enchanted castle, and outraged the peace of the garden of enchantments. 'It isn't such a lark after all,' Gerald admitted, as from the window of the stone summer-house at the end of the terrace they watched the loud colours and heard the loud laughter. 'I do hate to see all these people in our garden.' 'I said that to that nice bailiff-man this morning,' said Mabel, setting herself on the stone floor, 'and he said it wasn't much to let them come once a week. He said Lord Yalding ought to let them come when they liked said he would if he lived there.' 'That's all he knows!' said Jimmy. 'Did he say anything else?' 'Lots,' said Mabel. 'I do like him! I told him ,' 'You didn't!' 'Yes. I told him lots about our adventures. The humble bailiff is a beautiful listener.' 'We shall be locked up for beautiful lunatics if you let your jaw get the better of you, my Mabel child.' 'Not us!' said Mabel. 'I told it you know the way every word true, and yet so that nobody believes any of it. When I'd quite done he said I'd got a real littery talent, and I promised to put his name on the beginning of the first book I write when I grow up.' 'You don't know his name,' said Kathleen. 'Let's do something with the ring.' 'Imposs!' said Gerald. 'I forgot to tell you, but I met Mademoiselle when I went back for my garters and she's coming to meet us and walk back with us.' 'What did you say?' 'I said,' said Gerald deliberately, 'that it was very kind of her. And so it was. Us not wanting her doesn't make it not kind her coming ' 'It may be kind, but it's sickening too,' said Mabel, 'because now I suppose we shall have to stick here and wait for her; and I promised we d meet the bailiff-man. He's going to bring things in a basket and have a picnic-tea with us.' 'Where?' 'Beyond the dinosaurus. He said he'd tell me all about the anteddy-something animals it means before Noah's Ark; there are lots besides the dinosaurus in return for me telling him my agreeable fictions. Yes, he called them that.' 'When?' 'As soon as the gates shut. That's five.' 'We might take Mademoiselle along,' suggested Gerald. 'She d be too proud to have tea with a bailiff, I expect; you never know how grown-ups will take the simplest things.' It was Kathleen who said this. 'Well, I'll tell you what,' said Gerald, lazily turning on the stone bench. 'You all go along, and meet your bailiff. A picnic's a picnic. And I'll wait for Mademoiselle.' Mabel remarked joyously that this was jolly decent of Gerald, to which he modestly replied: 'Oh, rot!' Jimmy added that Gerald rather liked sucking-up to people. 'Little boys don't understand diplomacy,' said Gerald calmly; 'sucking-up is simply silly. But it's better to be good than pretty and ,' 'How do you know?' Jimmy asked. 'And,' his brother went on, 'you never know when a grown-up may come in useful. Besides, they like it. You must give them some little pleasures. Think how awful it must be to be old. My hat!' 'I hope I shan't be an old maid,' said Kathleen. 'I don't mean to be,' said Mabel briskly. 'I'd rather marry a travelling tinker.' 'It would be rather nice,' Kathleen mused, 'to marry the Gypsy King and go about in a caravan telling fortunes and hung round with baskets and brooms.' 'Oh, if I could choose,' said Mabel, 'of course I'd marry a brigand, and live in his mountain fastnesses, and be kind to his captives and help them to escape and ,' 'You'll be a real treasure to your husband,' said Gerald. 'Yes,' said Kathleen, 'or a sailor would be nice. You'd watch for his ship coming home and set the lamp in the dormer window to light him home through the storm; and when he was drowned at sea you d be most frightfully sorry, and go every day to lay flowers on his daisied grave.' 'Yes,' Mabel hastened to say, 'or a soldier, and then you'd go to the wars with short petticoats and a cocked hat and a barrel round your neck like a St. Bernard dog. There's a picture of a soldier's wife on a song auntie's got. It's called 'The Veevandyear'.' 'When I marry ' Kathleen quickly said. 'When I marry,' said Gerald, 'I'll marry a dumb girl, or else get the ring to make her so that she can't speak unless she's spoken to. Let's have a squint. He applied his eye to the stone lattice. 'They're moving off,' he said. 'Those pink and purple hats are nodding off in the distant prospect; and the funny little man with the beard like a goat is going a different way from everyone else the gardeners will have to head him off. I don't see Mademoiselle, though. The rest of you had better bunk. It doesn't do to run any risks with picnics. The deserted hero of our tale, alone and unsupported, urged on his brave followers to pursue the commissariat waggons, he himself remaining at the post of danger and difficulty, because he was born to stand on burning decks whence all but he had fled, and to lead forlorn hopes when despaired of by the human race!' 'I think I'll marry a dumb husband,' said Mabel, 'and there shan't be any heroes in my books when I write them, only a heroine. Come on, Cathy.' Coming out of that cool, shadowy summer-house into the sunshine was like stepping into an oven, and the stone of the terrace was burning to the children's feet. 'I know now what a cat on hot bricks feels like,' said Jimmy. The antediluvian animals are set in a beech-wood on a slope at least half a mile across the park from the castle. The grandfather of the present Lord Yalding had them set there in the middle of last century, in the great days of the late Prince Consort, the Exhibition of 1851, Sir Joseph Paxton, and the Crystal Palace. Their stone flanks, their wide, ungainly wings, their lozenged crocodile-like backs show grey through the trees a long way off. Most people think that noon is the hottest time of the day. They are wrong. A cloudless sky gets hotter and hotter all the afternoon, and reaches its very hottest at five. I am sure you must all have noticed this when you are going out to tea anywhere in your best clothes, especially if your clothes are starched and you happen to have a rather long and shadeless walk. Kathleen, Mabel, and Jimmy got hotter and hotter, and went more and more slowly. They had almost reached that stage of resentment and discomfort when one 'wishes one hadn't come' before they saw, below the edge of the beech-wood, the white waved handkerchief of the bailiff. That banner, eloquent of tea, shade, and being able to sit down, put new heart into them. They mended their pace, and a final desperate run landed them among the drifted coppery leaves and bare grey and green roots of the beech-wood. 'Oh, glory!' said Jimmy, throwing himself down. 'How do you do?' The bailiff looked very nice, the girls thought. He was not wearing his velveteens, but a grey flannel suit that an Earl need not have scorned; and his straw hat would have done no discredit to a Duke; and a Prince could not have worn a prettier green tie. He welcomed the children warmly. And there were two baskets dumped heavy and promising among the beech-leaves. He was a man of tact. The hot, instructive tour of the stone antediluvians, which had loomed with ever-lessening charm before the children, was not even mentioned. 'You must be desert-dry,' he said, 'and you'll be hungry, too, when you've done being thirsty. I put on the kettle as soon as I discerned the form of my fair romancer in the extreme offing.' The kettle introduced itself with puffings and bubblings from the hollow between two grey roots where it sat on a spirit-lamp. 'Take off your shoes and stockings, won't you?' said the bailiff in matter-of-course tones, just as old ladies ask each other to take off their bonnets; 'there's a little baby canal just over the ridge.' The joys of dipping one's feet in cool running water after a hot walk have yet to be described. I could write pages about them. There was a mill-stream when I was young with little fishes in it, and dropped leaves that spun round, and willows and alders that leaned over it and kept it cool, and but this is not the story of my life. When they came back, on rested, damp, pink feet, tea was made and poured ouy delicious tea with as much milk as ever you wanted, out of a beer bottle with a screw top, and cakes, and gingerbread, and plums, and a big melon with a lump of ice in its heart a tea for the gods! This thought must have come to Jimmy, for he said suddenly, removing his face from inside a wide-bitten crescent of melon-rind: 'Your feast's as good as the feast of the Immortals, almost.' 'Explain your recondite allusion,' said the grey-flannelled host; and Jimmy, understanding him to say, 'What do you mean?' replied with the whole tale of that wonderful night when the statues came alive, and a banquet of unearthly splendour and deliciousness was plucked by marble hands from the trees of the lake island. When he had done the bailiff said: 'Did you get all this out of a book?' 'No,' said Jimmy, 'it happened.' 'You are an imaginative set of young dreamers,. aren't you?' the bailiff asked, handing the plums to Kathleen, who smiled, friendly but embarrassed. Why couldn't Jimmy have held his tongue? 'No, we re not,' said that indiscreet one obstinately; 'everything I've told you did happen, and so did the things Mabel told you.' The bailiff looked a little uncomfortable. 'All right, old chap,' he said. And there was a short, uneasy silence. 'Look here,' said Jimmy, who seemed for once to have got the bit between his teeth, 'do you believe me or not?' 'Don't be silly, Jimmy!' Kathleen whispered. 'Because, if you don't I'll make you believe.' 'Don't!' said Mabel and Kathleen together. 'Do you or don't you?' Jimmy insisted, lying on his front with his chin on his hands, his elbows on a moss-cushion, and his bare legs kicking among the beech leaves. 'I think you tell adventures awfully well,' said the bailiff cautiously. 'Very well,' said Jimmy, abruptly sitting up, 'you don't believe me. Nonsense, Cathy! he's a gentleman, even if he is a bailiff.' 'Thank you!' said the bailiff with eyes that twinkled. 'You won't tell, will you?' Jimmy urged. 'Tell what?' 'Anything.' 'Certainly not. I am, as you say, the soul of honour.' 'Then Cathy, give me the ring.' 'Oh, no!' said the girls together. Kathleen did not mean to give up the ring; Mabel did not mean that she should; Jimmy certainly used no force. Yet presently he held it in his hand. It was his hour. There are times like that for all of us, when what we say shall be done is done. 'Now,' said Jimmy, 'this is the ring Mabel told you about. I say it is a wishing-ring. And if you will put it on your hand and wish, whatever you wish will happen.' 'Must I wish out loud?' 'Yes I think so.' 'Don't wish for anything silly,' said Kathleen, making the best of the situation, 'like its being fine on Tuesday or its being your favourite pudding for dinner tomorrow. Wish for something you really want.' 'I will,' said the bailiff. 'I'll wish for the only thing I really want. I wish my I wish my friend were here.' The three who knew the power of the ring looked round to see the bailiff's friend appear; a surprised man that friend would be, they thought, and perhaps a frightened one. They had all risen, and stood ready to soothe and reassure the newcomer. But no startled gentleman appeared in the wood, only, coming quietly through the dappled sun and shadow under the beech-trees, Mademoiselle and Gerald, Mademoiselle in a white gown, looking quite nice and like a picture, Gerald hot and polite. 'Good afternoon,' said that dauntless leader of forlorn hopes. 'I persuaded Mademoiselle ' That sentence was never finished, for the bailiff and the French governess were looking at each other with the eyes of tired travellers who find, quite without expecting it, the desired end of a very long journey. And the children saw that even if they spoke it would not make any difference. 'You!' said the bailiff. 'Mais . . . c'est donc vous,' said Mademoiselle, in a funny choky voice. And they stood still and looked at each other, 'like stuck pigs' , as Jimmy said later, for quite a long time. 'Is she your friend?' Jimmy asked. 'Yes oh yes,' said the bailiff. 'You are my friend, are you not?' 'But yes,' Mademoiselle said softly. 'I am your friend.' 'There! you see,' said Jimmy, 'the ring does do what I said.' 'We won't quarrel about that,' said the bailiff. 'You can say it's the ring. For me it's a coincidence the happiest, the dearest ,' 'Then you ?' said the French governess. 'Of course,' said the bailiff. 'Jimmy, give your brother some tea. Mademoiselle, come and walk in the woods: there are a thousand things to say.' 'Eat then, my Gerald,' said Mademoiselle, now grown young, and astonishingly like a fairy princess. 'I return all at the hour, and we re-enter together. It is that we must speak each other. It is long time that we have not seen us, me and Lord Yalding!' 'So he was Lord Yalding all the time,' said Jimmy, breaking a stupefied silence as the white gown and the grey flannels disappeared among the beech trunks. 'Landscape painter sort of dodge silly, I call it. And fancy her being a friend of his, and his wishing she was here! Different from us, eh? Good old ring!' 'His friend!' said Mabel with strong scorn; 'Don't you see she's his lover? Don't you see she's the lady that was bricked up in the convent, because he was so poor, and he couldn't find her. And now the ring's made them live happy ever after. I am glad! Aren't you, Cathy?' 'Rather!' said Kathleen; 'it's as good as marrying a sailor or a bandit.' 'It's the ring did it,' said Jimmy. 'If the American takes the house he'll pay lots of rent, and they can live on that.' 'I wonder if they'll be married tomorrow!' said Mabel. 'Wouldn't if be fun if we were bridesmaids,' said Cathy. 'May I trouble you for the melon,' said Gerald. 'Thanks! Why didn't we know he was Lord Yalding? Apes and moles that we were!' 'I've known since last night,' said Mabel calmly; 'only I promised not to tell. I can keep a secret, can't I?' 'Too jolly well,' said Kathleen, a little aggrieved. 'He was disguised as a bailiff,' said Jimmy; 'that's why we didn't know.' 'Disguised as a fiddle-stick-end,' said Gerald. 'Ha, ha! I see something old Sherlock Holmes never saw, nor that idiot Watson, either. If you want a really impenetrable disguise, you ought to disguise yourself as what you really are. I'll remember that.' 'It's like Mabel, telling things so that you can't believe them,' said Cathy. 'I think Mademoiselle's jolly lucky,' said Mabel. 'She's not so bad. He might have done worse,' said Gerald. 'Plums, please!' There was quite plainly magic at work. Mademoiselle next morning was a changed governess. Her cheeks were pink, her lips were red, her eyes were larger and brighter, and she had done her hair in an entirely new way, rather frivolous and very becoming. 'Mamselle's coming out!' Eliza remarked. Immediately after breakfast Lord Yalding called with a wagonette that wore a smart blue cloth coat, and was drawn by two horses whose coats were brown and shining and fitted them even better than the blue cloth coat fitted the wagonette, and the whole party drove in state and splendour to Yalding Towers. Arrived there, the children clamoured for permission to explore the castle thoroughly, a thing that had never yet been possible. Lord Yalding, a little absent in manner, but yet quite cordial, consented. Mabel showed the others all the secret doors and unlikely passages and stairs that she had discovered. It was a glorious morning. Lord Yalding and Mademoiselle went through the house, it is true, but in a rather half-hearted way. Quite soon they were tired, and went out through the French windows of the drawing-room and through the rose garden, to sit on the curved stone seat in the middle of the maze, where once, at the beginning of things, Gerald, Kathleen, and Jimmy had found the sleeping Princess who wore pink silk and diamonds. The children felt that their going left to the castle a more spacious freedom, and explored with more than Arctic enthusiasm. It was as they emerged from the little rickety secret staircase that led from the powdering-room of the state suite to the gallery of the hall that they came suddenly face to face with the odd little man who had a beard like a goat and had taken the wrong turning yesterday. 'This part of the castle is private,' said Mabel, with great presence of mind, and shut the door behind her. 'I am aware of it,' said the goat-faced stranger, 'but I have the permission of the Earl of Yalding to examine the house at my leisure.' 'Oh!' said Mabel. 'I beg your pardon. We all do. We didn't know.' 'You are relatives of his lordship, I should surmise?' asked the goat-faced. 'Not exactly,' said Gerald. 'Friends'. The gentleman was thin and very neatly dressed; he had small, merry eyes and a face that was brown and dry-looking. 'You are playing some game, I should suppose?' 'No, sir,' said Gerald, 'only exploring.' 'May a stranger propose himself as a member of your Exploring Expedition?' asked the gentleman, smiling a tight but kind smile. The children looked at each other. 'You see,' said Gerald, 'it's rather difficult to explain  but you see what I mean, don't you?' 'He means,' said Jimmy, 'that we can't take you into an exploring party without we know what you want to go for.' 'Are you a photographer?' asked Mabel, 'or is it some newspaper's sent you to write about the Towers?' 'I understand your position,' said the gentleman. 'I am not a photographer, nor am I engaged by any journal. I am a man of independent means, travelling in this country with the intention of renting a residence. My name is Jefferson D. Conway.' 'Oh!' said Mabel; 'then you're the American millionaire.' 'I do not like the description, young lady,' said Mr. Jefferson D. Conway. 'I am an American citizen, and I am not without means. This is a fine property a very fine property. If it were for sale ,' 'It isn't, it can't be,' Mabel hastened to explain. 'The lawyers have put it in a tale, so Lord Yalding can't sell it. But you could take it to live in, and pay Lord Yalding a good millionairish rent, and then he could marry the French governess ' 'Shish!' said Kathleen and Mr. Jefferson D. Conway together, and he added: 'Lead the way, please; and I should suggest that the exploration be complete and exhaustive.' Thus encouraged, Mabel led the millionaire through all the castle. He seemed pleased, yet disappointed too. 'It is a fine mansion,' he said at last when they had come back to the point from which they had started; 'but I should suppose, in a house this size, there would mostly be a secret stairway, or a priests hiding place, or a ghost?' 'There are,' said Mabel briefly, 'but I thought Americans didn't believe in anything but machinery and newspapers.' She touched the spring of the panel behind her, and displayed the little tottery staircase to the American. The sight of it worked a wonderful transformation in him. He became eager, alert, very keen. 'Say!' he cried, over and over again, standing in the door that led from the powdering-room to the state bed-chamber. 'But this is great great!' The hopes of everyone ran high. It seemed almost certain that the castle would be let for a millionairish rent and Lord Yalding be made affluent to the point of marriage. 'If there were a ghost located in this ancestral pile, I'd close with the Earl of Yalding today, now, on the nail,' Mr. Jefferson D. Conway went on. 'If you were to stay till tomorrow, and sleep in this room, I expect you'd see the ghost,' said Mabel. 'There is a ghost located here then?' he said joyously. 'They say,' Mabel answered, 'that old Sir Rupert, who lost his head in Henry the Eighth's time, walks of a night here, with his head under his arm. But we've not seen that. What we have seen is the lady in a pink dress with diamonds in her hair. She carries a lighted taper,' Mabel hastily added. The others, now suddenly aware of Mabel's plan, hastened to assure the American in accents of earnest truth that they had all seen the lady with the pink gown. He looked at them with half-closed eyes that twinkled. 'Well,' he said, 'I calculate to ask the Earl of Yalding to permit me to pass a night in his ancestral best bed- chamber. And if I hear so much as a phantom footstep, or hear so much as a ghostly sigh, I'll take the place.' 'I am glad!' said Cathy. 'You appear to be very certain of your ghost,' said the American, still fixing them with little eyes that shone. 'Let me tell you, young gentlemen, that I carry a gun, and when I see a ghost, I shoot.' He pulled a pistol out of his hip-pocket, and looked at it lovingly. 'And I am a fair average shot,' he went on, walking across the shiny floor of the state bed-chamber to the open window. 'See that big red rose, like a tea-saucer?' They saw. The next moment a loud report broke the stillness, and the red petals of the shattered rose strewed balustrade and terrace. The American looked from one child to another. Every face was perfectly white. 'Jefferson D. Conway made his little pile by strict attention to business, and keeping his eyes skinned,' he added. 'Thank you for all your kindness.' 'Suppose you'd done it, and he'd shot you!' said Jimmy cheerfully. 'That would have been an adventure, wouldn't it?' 'I'm going to do it still,' said Mabel, pale and defiant. 'Let's find Lord Yalding and get the ring back.' Lord Yalding had had an interview with Mabel's aunt, and lunch for six was laid in the great dark hall, among the armour and the oak furniture a beautiful lunch served on silver dishes. Mademoiselle, becoming every moment younger and more like a Princess, was moved to tears when Gerald rose, lemonade-glass in hand, and proposed the health of 'Lord and Lady Yalding'. When Lord Yalding had returned thanks in a speech full of agreeable jokes the moment seemed to Gerald propitious, and he said: 'The ring, you know you don't believe in it, but we do. May we have it back?' And got it. Then, after a hasty council, held in the panelled jewel-room, Mabel said: 'This is a wishing-ring, and I wish all the American's weapons of all sorts were here.' Instantly the room was full six feet up the wall of a tangle and mass of weapons, swords, spears, arrows, tomahawks, fowling pieces, blunderbusses, pistols, revolvers, scimitars, kreeses every kind of weapon you can think of and the four children wedged in among all these weapons of death hardly dared to breathe. 'He collects arms, I expect,' said Gerald, 'and the arrows are poisoned, I shouldn't wonder. Wish them back where they came from, Mabel, for goodness sake, and try again.' Mabel wished the weapons away, and at once the four children stood safe in a bare panelled room. But 'No,', Mabel said, 'I can't stand it. We'll work the ghost another way. I wish the American may think he sees a ghost when he goes to bed. Sir Rupert with his head under his arm will do.' 'Is it tonight he sleeps there?' 'I don't know. I wish he may see Sir Rupert every night that'll make it all serene.' 'It's rather dull,' said Gerald; 'we shan't know whether he's seen Sir Rupert or not.' 'We shall know in the morning, when he takes the house.' This being settled, Mabel's aunt was found to be desirous of Mabel's company, so the others went home. It was when they were at supper that Lord Yalding suddenly appeared, and said: 'Mr. Jefferson Conway wants you boys to spend the night with him in the state chamber. I've had beds put up. You don't mind, do you? He seems to think you've got some idea of playing ghost-tricks on him.' It was difficult to refuse, so difficult that it proved impossible. Ten o clock found the boys each in a narrow white bed that looked quite absurdly small in that high, dark chamber, and in face of that tall gaunt four-poster hung with tapestry and ornamented with funereal-looking plumes. 'I hope to goodness there isn't a real ghost,' Jimmy whispered. 'Not likely,' Gerald whispered back. 'But I don't want to see Sir Rupert's ghost with its head under its arm,' Jimmy insisted. 'You won't. The most you'll see'll be the millionaire seeing it. Mabel said he was to see it, not us. Very likely you'll sleep all night and not see anything. Shut your eyes and count up to a million and don't be a goat!' As soon as Mabel had learned from her drab-haired aunt that this was indeed the night when Mr. Jefferson D. Conway would sleep at the castle she had hastened to add a wish, 'that Sir Rupert and his head may appear tonight in the state bedroom.' Jimmy shut his eyes and began to count a million. Before he had counted it he fell asleep. So did his brother. They were awakened by the loud echoing bang of a pistol shot. Each thought of the shot that had been fired that morning, and opened eyes that expected to see a sunshiny terrace and red-rose petals strewn upon warm white stone. Instead, there was the dark, lofty state chamber, lighted but little by six tall candles; there was the American in shirt and trousers, a smoking pistol in his hand; and there, advancing from the door of the powdering-room, a figure in doublet and hose, a ruff round its neck and no head! The head, sure enough, was there; but it was under the right arm, held close in the slashed-velvet sleeve of the doublet. The face looking from under the arm wore a pleasant smile. Both boys, I am sorry to say, screamed. The American fired again. The bullet passed through Sir Rupert, who advanced without appearing to notice it. Then, suddenly, the lights went out. The next thing the boys knew it was morning. A grey daylight shone blankly through the tall windows and wild rain was beating upon the glass, and the American was gone. 'Where are we?' said Jimmy, sitting up with tangled hair and looking round him. 'Oh, I remember. Ugh! it was horrid. I'm about fed up with that ring, so 1 don't mind telling you.' 'Nonsense!' said Gerald. 'I enjoyed it. I wasn't a bit frightened, were you?' 'No,' said Jimmy, 'of course I wasn't. 'We've done the trick,' said Gerald later when they learned that the American had breakfasted early with Lord Yalding and taken the first train to London; 'he's gone to get rid of his other house, and take this one. The old ring's beginning to do really useful things.' 'Perhaps you'll believe in the ring now,' said Jimmy to Lord Yalding, whom he met later on in the picture-gallery; 'it's all our doing that Mr. Jefferson saw the ghost. He told us he'd take the house if he saw a ghost, so of course we took care he did see one.' 'Oh, you did, did you?' said Lord Yalding in rather an odd voice. 'I'm very much obliged, I'm sure.' 'Don't mention it,' said Jimmy kindly. 'I thought you'd be pleased and him too.' 'Perhaps you'll be interested to learn,' said Lord Yalding, putting his hands in his pockets and staring down at Jimmy, 'that Mr. Jefferson D. Conway was so pleased with your ghost that he got me out of bed at six o clock this morning to talk about it.' 'Oh, ripping!' said Jimmy. 'What did he say?' 'He said, as far as I can remember,' said Lord Yalding, still in the same strange voice 'he said: 'My lord, your ancestral pile is Al. It is, in fact, The Limit. Its luxury is palatial, its grounds are nothing short of Edenesque. No expense has been spared, I should surmise. Your ancestors were whole-hoggers. They have done the thing as it should be done every detail attended to. I like your tapestry, and I like your oak, and I like your secret stairs. But I think your ancestors should have left well enough alone, and stopped at that.' So I said they had, as far as I knew, and he shook his head and said: 'No, Sir. Your ancestors take the air of a night with their heads under their arms. A ghost that sighed or glided or rustled I could have stood, and thanked you for it, and considered it in the rent. But a ghost that bullets go through while it stands grinning with a bare neck and its head loose under its own arm and little boys screaming and fainting in their beds no! What I say is, If this is a British hereditary high-toned family ghost, excuse me!' And he went off by the early train. 'I say,' the stricken Jimmy remarked, 'I am sorry, and I don't think we did faint, really I don't but we thought it would be just what you wanted. And perhaps someone else will take the house.' 'I don't know anyone else rich enough,' said Lord Yalding. 'Mr. Conway came the day before he said he would, or you'd never have got hold of him. And I don't know how you did it, and I don't want to know. It was a rather silly trick.' There was a gloomy pause. The rain beat against the long windows. 'I say' Jimmy looked up at Lord Yalding with the light of a new idea in his round face 'I say, if you're hard up, why don't you sell your jewels?' 'I haven't any jewels, you meddlesome young duffer,' said Lord Yalding quite crossly; and taking his hands out of his pockets, he began to walk away. 'I mean the ones in the panelled room with the stars in the ceiling,' Jimmy insisted, following him. 'There aren't any,' said Lord Yalding shortly; 'and if this is some more ring-nonsense I advise you to be careful, young man. I've had about as much as I care for.' 'It's not ring-nonsense, said Jimmy: 'there are shelves and shelves of beautiful family jewels. You can sell them and ,' 'Oh, no!' cried Mademoiselle, appearing like an oleograph of a duchess in the door of the picture-gallery; 'don't sell the family jewels ' 'There aren't any, my lady,' said Lord Yalding, going towards her. 'I thought you were never coming.' 'Oh, aren't there!' said Mabel, who had followed Mademoiselle. 'You just come and see,' 'Let us see what they will to show us,' cried Mademoiselle, for Lord Yalding did not move; 'it should at least be amusing.' 'It is,' said Jimmy. So they went, Mabel and Jimmy leading, while Mademoiselle and Lord Yalding followed, hand in hand. 'It's much safer to walk hand in hand,' said Lord Yalding; 'with these children at large one never knows what may happen next.' It would be interesting, no doubt, to describe the feelings of Lord Yalding as he followed Mabel and Jimmy through his ancestral halls, but I have no means of knowing at all what he felt. Yet one must suppose that he felt something: bewilderment, perhaps, mixed with a faint wonder, and a desire to pinch himself to see if he were dreaming. Or he may have pondered the rival questions, 'Am I mad? Are they mad?' without being at all able to decide which he ought to try to answer, let alone deciding what, in either case, the answer ought to be. You see, the children did seem to believe in the odd stories they told and the wish had come true, and the ghost had appeared. He must have thought but all this is vain; I don't really know what he thought any more than you do. Nor can I give you any clew to the thoughts and feelings of Mademoiselle. I only know that she was very happy, but anyone would have known that if they had seen her face. Perhaps this is as good a moment as any to explain that when her guardian had put her in a convent so that she should not sacrifice her fortune by marrying a poor lord, her guardian had secured that fortune (to himself) by going off with it to South America. Then, having no money left, Mademoiselle had to work for it. So she went out as governess, and took the situation she did take because it was near Lord Yalding's home. She wanted to see him, even though she thought he had forsaken her and did not love her any more. And now she had seen him. I dare say she thought about some of these things as she went along through his house, her hand held in his. But of course I can't be sure. Jimmy's thoughts, of course, I can read like any old book. He thought, 'Now he'll have to believe me.' That Lord Yalding should believe him had become, quite unreasonably, the most important thing in the world to Jimmy. He wished that Gerald and Kathleen were there to share his triumph, but they were helping Mabel's aunt to cover the grand furniture up, and so were out of what followed. Not that they missed much, for when Mabel proudly said, 'Now you'll see, and the others came close round her in the little panelled room, there was a pause, and then nothing happened at all! 'There's a secret spring here somewhere,' said Mabel, fumbling with fingers that had suddenly grown hot and damp. 'Where?' said Lord Yalding. 'Here,' said Mabel impatiently, 'only I can't find it.' And she couldn't. She found the spring of the secret panel under the window all right, but that seemed to everyone dull compared with the jewels that everyone had pictured and two at least had seen. But the spring that made the oak panelling slide away and displayed jewels plainly to any eye worth a king's ransom this could not be found. More, it was simply not there. There could be no doubt of that. Every inch of the panelling was felt by careful fingers. The earnest protests of Mabel and Jimmy died away presently in a silence made painful by the hotness of one's ears, the discomfort of not liking to meet anyone's eyes, and the resentful feeling that the spring was not behaving in at all a sportsmanlike way, and that, in a word, this was not cricket. 'You see!' said Lord Yalding severely. 'Now you've had your joke, if you call it a joke, and I've had enough of the whole silly business. Give me the ring it's mine, I suppose, since you say you found it somewhere here and don't let's hear another word about all this rubbish of magic and enchantment.' 'Gerald's got the ring,' said Mabel miserably. 'Then go and fetch him,' said Lord Yalding 'both of you.' The melancholy pair retired, and Lord Yalding spent the time of their absence in explaining to Mademoiselle how very unimportant jewels were compared with other things. The four children came back together. 'We've had enough of this ring business,' said Lord Yalding. 'Give it to me and we'll say no more about it.' 'I I can't get it off,' said Gerald. 'It it always did have a will of its own.' 'I'll soon get it off,' said Lord Yalding. But he didn't. 'We'll try soap,' he said firmly. Four out of his five hearers knew just exactly how much use soap would be. 'They won't believe about the jewels,' wailed Mabel, suddenly dissolved in tears, 'and I can't find the spring. I've felt all over we all have it was just here, and ' Her fingers felt it as she spoke; and as she ceased to speak the carved panels slid away, and the blue velvet shelves laden with jewels were disclosed to the unbelieving eyes of Lord Yalding and the lady who was to be his wife. 'Jove!' said Lord Yalding. 'Misericorde!' said the lady. 'But why now?' gasped Mabel. 'Why not before?' 'I expect it's magic,' said Gerald. 'There's no real spring here, and it couldn't act because the ring wasn't here. You know Phoebus told us the ring was the heart of all the magic.' 'Shut it up and take the ring away and see. They did, and Gerald was (as usual, he himself pointed out) proved to be right. When the ring was away there was no spring; when the ring was in the room there (as Mabel urged) was the spring all right enough. 'So you see,' said Mabel to Lord Yalding. 'I see that the spring's very artfully concealed,' said that dense peer. 'I think it was very clever indeed of you to find it. And if those jewels are real ,' 'Of course they're real,' said Mabel indignantly. 'Well, anyway,' said Lord Yalding, 'thank you all very much. I think it's clearing up. I'll send the wagonette home with you after lunch. And if you don't mind, I'll have the ring.' Half an hour of soap and water produced no effect whatever, except to make the finger of Gerald very red and very sore. Then Lord Yalding said something very impatient indeed, and then Gerald suddenly became angry and said: 'Well, I'm sure I wish it would come off,' and of course instantly, 'slick as butter' , as he later pointed out, off it came. 'Thank you,' said Lord Yalding. 'And I believe now he thinks I kept it on on purpose,' said Gerald afterwards when, at ease on the leads at home, they talked the whole thing out over a tin of preserved pineapple and a bottle of ginger-beer apiece. 'There's no pleasing some people. He wasn't in such a fiery hurry to order that wagonette after he found that Mademoiselle meant to go when we did. But I liked him better when he was a humble bailiff. Take him for all in all, he does not look as if we should like him again. 'He doesn't know what's the matter with him,' said Kathleen, leaning back against the tiled roof) 'it's really the magic it's like sickening with measles.' Don't you remember how cross Mabel was at first about the invisibleness?' 'Rather!' said Jimmy. 'It's partly that,' said Gerald, trying to be fair, 'and partly it's the being in love. It always makes people like idiots a chap at school told me. His sister was like that . quite rotten, you know. And she used to be quite a decent sort before she was engaged.' At tea and at supper Mademoiselle was radiant as attractive as a lady on a Christmas card, as merry as a marmoset, and as kind as you would always be yourself if you could take the trouble. At breakfast, an equal radiance, kindness, attraction, merriment. Then Lord Yalding came to see her. The meeting took place in the drawing-room; the children with deep discreetness remained shut in the school-room till Gerald, going up to his room for a pencil, surprised Eliza with her ear glued to the drawing-room key-hole. After that Gerald sat on the top stair with a book. He could not hear any of the conversation in the drawing-room, but he could command a view of the door, and in this way be certain that no one else heard any of it. Thus it was that when the drawing-room door opened Gerald was in a position to see Lord Yalding come out. 'Our young hero, as he said later, 'coughed with infinite tact to show that he was there,' but Lord Yalding did not seem to notice. He walked in a blind sort of way to the hat-stand, fumbled clumsily with the umbrellas and macintoshes, found his straw hat and looked at it gloomily, crammed it on his head and went out, banging the door behind him in the most reckless way. He left the drawing-room door open, and Gerald, though he had purposely put himself in a position where one could hear nothing from the drawing-room when the door was shut, could hear something quite plainly now that the door was open. That something, he noticed with deep distress and disgust, was the sound of sobs and sniffs. Mademoiselle was quite certainly crying. 'Jimminy!' he remarked to himself, 'they haven't lost much time. Fancy their beginning to quarrel already! I hope I'll never have to be anybody's lover.' But this was no time to brood on the terrors of his own future. Eliza might at any time occur. She would not for a moment hesitate to go through that open door, and push herself into the very secret sacred heart of Mademoiselle's grief. It seemed to Gerald better that he should be the one to do this. So he went softly down the worn green Dutch carpet of the stairs and into the drawing-room, shutting the door softly and securely behind him. 'It is all over,' Mademoiselle was saying, her face buried in the beady arum-lilies on a red ground worked for a cushion cover by a former pupil: 'he will not marry me!' Do not ask me how Gerald had gained the lady's confidence. He had, as I think I said almost at the beginning, very pretty ways with grown-ups, when he chose. Anyway, he was holding her hand, almost as affectionately as if she had been his mother with a headache, and saying 'Don't!' and 'Don't cry!' and 'It'll be all right, you see if it isn't' in the most comforting way you can imagine, varying the treatment with gentle thumps on the back and entreaties to her to tell him all about it. This wasn't mere curiosity, as you might think. The entreaties were prompted by Gerald's growing certainty that whatever was the matter was somehow the fault of that ring. And in this Gerald was ('once more, as he told himself) right. The tale, as told by Mademoiselle, was certainly an unusual one. Lord Yalding, last night after dinner, had walked in the park 'to think of ' 'Yes, I know,' said Gerald; 'and he had the ring on. And he saw ' 'He saw the monuments become alive,' sobbed Mademoiselle; 'his brain was troubled by the ridiculous accounts of fairies that you tell him. He sees Apollon and Aphrodite alive on their marble. He remembers him of your story. He wish himself a statue. Then he becomes mad imagines to himself that your story of the island is true, plunges in the lake, swims among the beasts of the Ark of Noe, feeds with gods on an island. At dawn the madness become less. He think the Pantheon vanish. But him, no he thinks himself statue, hiding from gardeners in his garden till nine less a quarter. Then he thinks to wish himself no more a statue and perceives that he is flesh and blood. A bad dream, but he has lost the head with the tales you tell. He say it is no dream but he is fool mad how you say? And a mad man must not marry. There is no hope. I am at despair! And the life is vain!' 'There is,' said Gerald earnestly. 'I assure you there is hope, I mean. And life's as right as rain really. And there's nothing to despair about. He's not mad, and it's not a dream. It's magic. It really and truly is.' 'The magic exists not,' Mademoiselle moaned; 'it is that he is mad. It is the joy to re-see me after so many days. Oh, la-la-la-la-la!' 'Did he talk to the gods?' Gerald asked gently. 'It is there the most mad of all his ideas. He say that Mercure give him rendezvous at some temple tomorrow when the moon raise herself.' 'Right,' cried Gerald, 'righto! Dear nice, kind, pretty Mademoiselle Rapunzel, don't be a silly little duffer' he lost himself for a moment among the consoling endearments he was accustomed to offer to Kathleen in moments of grief and emotion, but hastily added: 'I mean, do not be a lady who weeps causelessly. Tomorrow he will go to that temple. I will go. Thou shalt go he will go. We will go you will go let 'em all go! And, you see, it's going to be absolutely all right. He'll see he isn't mad, and you'll understand all about everything. Take my handkerchief, it's quite a clean one as it happens; I haven't even unfolded it. Oh! do stop crying, there's a dear, darling, long-lost lover.' This flood of eloquence was not without effect. She took his handkerchief, sobbed, half smiled, dabbed at her eyes, and said: 'Oh, naughty! Is it some trick you play him, like the ghost?' 'I can't explain,' said Gerald, 'but I give you my word of honour you know what an Englishman's word of honour is, don't you? even if you are French  that everything is going to be exactly what you wish. I've never told you a lie. Believe me!' 'It is curious,' said she, drying her eyes, 'but I do.' And once again, so suddenly that he could not have resisted, she kissed him. I think, however, that in this her hour of sorrow he would have thought it mean to resist. 'It pleases her and it doesn't hurt me much,' would have been his thought. And now it is near moonrise. The French governess, half-doubting, half-hoping, but wholly longing to be near Lord Yalding even if he be as mad as a March hare, and the four children they have collected Mabel by an urgent letter-card posted the day before are going over the dewy grass. The moon has not yet risen, but her light is in the sky mixed with the pink and purple of the sunset. The west is heavy with ink-clouds and rich colour, but the east, where the moon rises, is clear as a rock-pool. They go across the lawn and through the beech wood and come at last, through a tangle of underwood and bramble, to a little level tableland that rises out of the flat hill-top one tableland out of another. Here is the ring of vast rugged stones, one pierced with a curious round hole, worn smooth at its edges. In the middle of the circle is a great flat stone, alone, desolate, full of meaning a stone that is covered thick with the memory of old faiths and creeds long since forgotten. Something dark moves in the circle. The French girl breaks from the children, goes to it, clings to its arm. It is Lord Yalding, and he is telling her to go. 'Never of the life!' she cries. 'If you are mad I am mad too, for I believe the tale these children tell. And I am here to be with thee and see with thee whatever the rising moon shall show us.' The children, holding hands by the flat stone, more moved by the magic in the girl's voice than by any magic of enchanted rings, listen, trying not to listen. 'Are you not afraid?' Lord Yalding is saying. 'Afraid? With you?' she laughs. He put his arm round her. The children hear her sigh. 'Are you afraid,' he says, 'my darling?' Gerald goes across the wide turf ring expressly to say: 'You can't be afraid if you are wearing the ring. And I'm sorry, but we can hear every word you say.' She laughs again. 'It makes nothing,' she says 'you know already if we love each other.' Then he puts the ring on her finger, and they stand together. The white of his flannel coat sleeve marks no line on the white of her dress; they stand as though cut out of one block of marble. Then a faint greyness touches the top of that round hole, creeps up the side. Then the hole is a disc of light a moonbeam strikes straight through it across the grey green of the circle that the stones mark, and as the moon rises the moonbeam slants downward. The children have drawn back till they stand close to the lovers. The moonbeam slants more and more; now it touches the far end of the stone, now it draws nearer and nearer to the middle of it, now at last it touches the very heart and centre of that central stone. And then it is as though a spring were touched, a fountain of light released. Everything changes or, rather, everything is revealed. There are no more secrets. The plan of the world seems plain, like an easy sum that one writes in big figures on a child's slate. One wonders how one can ever have wondered about anything. Space is not; every place that one has seen or dreamed of is here. Time is not; into this instant is crowded all that one has ever done or dreamed of doing. It is a moment and it is eternity. It is the centre of the universe and it is the universe itself. The eternal light rests on and illuminates the eternal heart of things. None of the six human beings who saw that moon-rising were ever able to think about it as having anything to do with time. Only for one instant could that moon-ray have rested full on the centre of that stone. And yet there was time for many happenings. From that height one could see far out over the quiet park and sleeping gardens, and through the grey green of them shapes moved, approaching. The great beasts came first: strange forms that were when the world was new  gigantic lizards with wings dragons they lived as in men's memories mammoths, strange vast birds, they crawled up the hill and ranged themselves outside the circle. Then, not from the garden but from very far away, came the stone gods of Egypt and Assyria bull-bodied, bird-winged, hawk-headed, cat-headed, all in stone, and all alive and alert; strange, grotesque figures from the towers of cathedrals figures of angels with folded wings, figures of beasts with wings wide spread; sphinxes; uncouth idols from Southern palm-fringed islands; and, last of all, the beautiful marble shapes of the gods and goddesses who had held their festival on the lake-island, and bidden Lord Yalding and the children to this meeting. Not a word was spoken. Each stone shape came gladly and quietly into the circle of light and understanding, as children, tired with a long ramble, creep quietly through the open door into the firelit welcome of home. The children had thought to ask many questions. And it had been promised that the questions should be answered. Yet now no one spoke a word, because all had come into the circle of the real magic where all things are understood without speech. Afterwards none of them could ever remember at all what had happened. But they never forgot that they had been somewhere where everything was easy and beautiful. And people who can remember even that much are never quite the same again. And when they came to talk of it next day they found that to each some little part of that night's great enlightenment was left. All the stone creatures drew closer round the stone the light where the moonbeam struck it seemed to break away in spray such as water makes when it falls from a height. All the crowd was bathed in whiteness. A deep hush lay over the vast assembly. Then a wave of intention swept over the mighty crowd. All the faces, bird, beast, Greek statue, Babylonian monster, human child and human lover, turned upward, the radiant light illumined them and one word broke from all. 'The light!' they cried, and the sound of their voice was like the sound of a great wave; 'the light! the light ' And then the light was not any more, and, soft as floating thistle-down, sleep was laid on the eyes of all but the immortals. The grass was chill and dewy and the clouds had veiled the moon. The lovers and the children were standing together, all clinging close, not for fear, but for love. 'I want,' said the French girl softly, 'to go to the cave on the island.' Very quietly through the gentle brooding night they went down to the boat-house, loosed the clanking chain, and dipped oars among the drowned stars and lilies. They came to the island, and found the steps. 'I brought candles,' said Gerald, 'in case.' So, lighted by Gerald's candles, they went down into the Hall of Psyche! and there glowed the light spread from her statue, and all was as the children had seen it before. It is the Hall of Granted Wishes. 'The ring,' said Lord Yalding. 'The ring,' said his lover, 'is the magic ring given long ago to a mortal, and it is what you say it is. It was given to your ancestor by a lady of my house that he might build her a garden and a house like her own palace and garden in her own land. So that this place is built partly by his love and partly by that magic. She never lived to see it; that was the price of the magic.' It must have been English that she spoke, for otherwise how could the children have understood her? Yet the words were not like Mademoiselle's way of speaking. 'Except from children,' her voice went on, 'the ring exacts a payment. You paid for me, when I came by your wish, by this terror of madness that you have since known. Only one wish is free.' 'And that wish is ,' 'The last,' she said. 'Shall I wish?' 'Yes wish,' they said, all of them. 'I wish, then,' said Lord Yalding's lover, 'that all the magic this ring has wrought may be undone, and that the ring itself may be no more and no less than a charm to bind thee and me together for evermore.' She ceased. And as she ceased the enchanted light died away, the windows of granted wishes went out, like magic-lantern pictures. Gerald's candle faintly lighted a rudely arched cave, and where Psyche's statue had been was a stone with something carved on it. Gerald held the light low. 'It is her grave,' the girl said. Next day no one could remember anything at all exactly. But a good many things were changed. There was no ring but the plain gold ring that Mademoiselle found clasped in her hand when she woke in her own bed in the morning. More than half the jewels in the panelled room were gone, and those that remained had no panelling to cover them; they just lay bare on the velvet-covered shelves. There was no passage at the back of the Temple of Flora. Quite a lot of the secret passages and hidden rooms had disappeared. And there were not nearly so many statues in the garden as everyone had supposed. And large pieces of the castle were missing and had to be replaced at great expense. From which we may conclude that Lord Yalding's ancestor had used the ring a good deal to help him in his building. However, the jewels that were left were quite enough to pay for everything. The suddenness with which all the ring-magic was undone was such a shock to everyone concerned that they now almost doubt that any magic ever happened. But it is certain that Lord Yalding married the French governess and that a plain gold ring was used in the ceremony, and this, if you come to think of it, could be no other than the magic ring, turned, by that last wish, into a charm to keep him and his wife together for ever. Also, if all this story is nonsense and a make-up if Gerald and Jimmy and Kathleen and Mabel have merely imposed on my trusting nature by a pack of unlikely inventions, how do you account for the paragraph which appeared in the evening papers the day after the magic of the moon-rising? 'MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF A WELL-KNOWN CITY MAN,' it said, and then went on to say how a gentleman, well known and much respected in financial circles, had vanished, leaving no trace. 'Mr. U. W. Ugli,' the papers continued, 'had remained late, working at his office as was his occasional habit. The office door was found locked, and on its being broken open the clothes of the unfortunate gentleman were found in a heap on the floor, together with an umbrella, a walking stick, a golf club, and, curiously enough, a feather brush, such as housemaids use for dusting. Of his body, however, there was no trace. The police are stated to have a clew.' If they have, they have kept it to themselves. But I do not think they can have a clew, because, of course, that respected gentleman was the Ugly-Wugly who became real when, in search of a really good hotel, he got into the Hall of Granted Wishes. And if none of this story ever happened, how is it that those four children are such friends with Lord and Lady Yalding, and stay at The Towers almost every holidays? It is all very well for all of them to pretend that the whole of this story is my own invention: facts are facts, and you can't explain them away. Chapter I. The beginning of things. They were not railway children to begin with. I don't suppose they had ever thought about railways except as a means of getting to Maskelyne and Cook's, the Pantomime, Zoological Gardens, and Madame Tussaud's. They were just ordinary suburban children, and they lived with their Father and Mother in an ordinary red-brick-fronted villa, with coloured glass in the front door, a tiled passage that was called a hall, a bath-room with hot and cold water, electric bells, French windows, and a good deal of white paint, and 'every modern convenience', as the house-agents say. There were three of them. Roberta was the eldest. Of course, Mothers never have favourites, but if their Mother HAD had a favourite, it might have been Roberta. Next came Peter, who wished to be an Engineer when he grew up; and the youngest was Phyllis, who meant extremely well. Mother did not spend all her time in paying dull calls to dull ladies, and sitting dully at home waiting for dull ladies to pay calls to her. She was almost always there, ready to play with the children, and read to them, and help them to do their home-lessons. Besides this she used to write stories for them while they were at school, and read them aloud after tea, and she always made up funny pieces of poetry for their birthdays and for other great occasions, such as the christening of the new kittens, or the refurnishing of the doll's house, or the time when they were getting over the mumps. These three lucky children always had everything they needed: pretty clothes, good fires, a lovely nursery with heaps of toys, and a Mother Goose wall-paper. They had a kind and merry nursemaid, and a dog who was called James, and who was their very own. They also had a Father who was just perfect, never cross, never unjust, and always ready for a game, at least, if at any time he was NOT ready, he always had an excellent reason for it, and explained the reason to the children so interestingly and funnily that they felt sure he couldn't help himself. You will think that they ought to have been very happy. And so they were, but they did not know HOW happy till the pretty life in the Red Villa was over and done with, and they had to live a very different life indeed. The dreadful change came quite suddenly. Peter had a birthday, his tenth. Among his other presents was a model engine more perfect than you could ever have dreamed of. The other presents were full of charm, but the Engine was fuller of charm than any of the others were. Its charm lasted in its full perfection for exactly three days. Then, owing either to Peter's inexperience or Phyllis's good intentions, which had been rather pressing, or to some other cause, the Engine suddenly went off with a bang. James was so frightened that he went out and did not come back all day. All the Noah's Ark people who were in the tender were broken to bits, but nothing else was hurt except the poor little engine and the feelings of Peter. The others said he cried over it, but of course boys of ten do not cry, however terrible the tragedies may be which darken their lot. He said that his eyes were red because he had a cold. This turned out to be true, though Peter did not know it was when he said it, the next day he had to go to bed and stay there. Mother began to be afraid that he might be sickening for measles, when suddenly he sat up in bed and said: “I hate gruel, I hate barley water, I hate bread and milk. I want to get up and have something REAL to eat.” “What would you like?” Mother asked. “A pigeon-pie,” said Peter, eagerly, “a large pigeon-pie. A very large one.” So Mother asked the Cook to make a large pigeon-pie. The pie was made. And when the pie was made, it was cooked. And when it was cooked, Peter ate some of it. After that his cold was better. Mother made a piece of poetry to amuse him while the pie was being made. It began by saying what an unfortunate but worthy boy Peter was, then it went on:       He had an engine that he loved         With all his heart and soul,       And if he had a wish on earth         It was to keep it whole.       One day, my friends, prepare your minds;         I'm coming to the worst,        Quite suddenly a screw went mad,         And then the boiler burst!       With gloomy face he picked it up         And took it to his Mother,       Though even he could not suppose         That she could make another;       For those who perished on the line         He did not seem to care,       His engine being more to him         Than all the people there.       And now you see the reason why         Our Peter has been ill:       He soothes his soul with pigeon-pie         His gnawing grief to kill.       He wraps himself in blankets warm         And sleeps in bed till late,       Determined thus to overcome         His miserable fate.       And if his eyes are rather red,         His cold must just excuse it:       Offer him pie; you may be sure         He never will refuse it. Father had been away in the country for three or four days. All Peter's hopes for the curing of his afflicted Engine were now fixed on his Father, for Father was most wonderfully clever with his fingers. He could mend all sorts of things. He had often acted as veterinary surgeon to the wooden rocking-horse; once he had saved its life when all human aid was despaired of, and the poor creature was given up for lost, and even the carpenter said he didn't see his way to do anything. And it was Father who mended the doll's cradle when no one else could; and with a little glue and some bits of wood and a pen-knife made all the Noah's Ark beasts as strong on their pins as ever they were, if not stronger. Peter, with heroic unselfishness, did not say anything about his Engine till after Father had had his dinner and his after-dinner cigar. The unselfishness was Mother's idea, but it was Peter who carried it out. And needed a good deal of patience, too. At last Mother said to Father, “Now, dear, if you're quite rested, and quite comfy, we want to tell you about the great railway accident, and ask your advice.” “All right,” said Father, “fire away!” So then Peter told the sad tale, and fetched what was left of the Engine. “Hum,” said Father, when he had looked the Engine over very carefully. The children held their breaths. “Is there NO hope?” said Peter, in a low, unsteady voice. “Hope? Rather! Tons of it,” said Father, cheerfully; “but it'll want something besides hope, a bit of brazing say, or some solder, and a new valve. I think we'd better keep it for a rainy day. In other words, I'll give up Saturday afternoon to it, and you shall all help me.” “CAN girls help to mend engines?” Peter asked doubtfully. “Of course they can. Girls are just as clever as boys, and don't you forget it! How would you like to be an engine-driver, Phil?” “My face would be always dirty, wouldn't it?” said Phyllis, in unenthusiastic tones, “and I expect I should break something.” “I should just love it,” said Roberta, “do you think I could when I'm grown up, Daddy? Or even a stoker?” “You mean a fireman,” said Daddy, pulling and twisting at the engine. “Well, if you still wish it, when you're grown up, we'll see about making you a fire-woman. I remember when I was a boy, ” Just then there was a knock at the front door. “Who on earth!” said Father. “An Englishman's house is his castle, of course, but I do wish they built semi-detached villas with moats and drawbridges.” Ruth, she was the parlour-maid and had red hair, came in and said that two gentlemen wanted to see the master. “I've shown them into the Library, Sir,” said she. “I expect it's the subscription to the Vicar's testimonial,” said Mother, “or else it's the choir holiday fund. Get rid of them quickly, dear. It does break up an evening so, and it's nearly the children's bedtime.” But Father did not seem to be able to get rid of the gentlemen at all quickly. “I wish we HAD got a moat and drawbridge,” said Roberta; “then, when we didn't want people, we could just pull up the drawbridge and no one else could get in. I expect Father will have forgotten about when he was a boy if they stay much longer.” Mother tried to make the time pass by telling them a new fairy story about a Princess with green eyes, but it was difficult because they could hear the voices of Father and the gentlemen in the Library, and Father's voice sounded louder and different to the voice he generally used to people who came about testimonials and holiday funds. Then the Library bell rang, and everyone heaved a breath of relief. “They're going now,” said Phyllis; “he's rung to have them shown out.” But instead of showing anybody out, Ruth showed herself in, and she looked queer, the children thought. “Please'm,” she said, “the Master wants you to just step into the study. He looks like the dead, mum; I think he's had bad news. You'd best prepare yourself for the worst, 'm, p'raps it's a death in the family or a bank busted or, ” “That'll do, Ruth,” said Mother gently; “you can go.” Then Mother went into the Library. There was more talking. Then the bell rang again, and Ruth fetched a cab. The children heard boots go out and down the steps. The cab drove away, and the front door shut. Then Mother came in. Her dear face was as white as her lace collar, and her eyes looked very big and shining. Her mouth looked like just a line of pale red, her lips were thin and not their proper shape at all. “It's bedtime,” she said. “Ruth will put you to bed.” “But you promised we should sit up late tonight because Father's come home,” said Phyllis. “Father's been called away, on business,” said Mother. “Come, darlings, go at once.” They kissed her and went. Roberta lingered to give Mother an extra hug and to whisper: “It wasn't bad news, Mammy, was it? Is anyone dead, or, ” “Nobody's dead, no,” said Mother, and she almost seemed to push Roberta away. “I can't tell you anything tonight, my pet. Go, dear, go NOW.” So Roberta went. Ruth brushed the girls' hair and helped them to undress. (Mother almost always did this herself.) When she had turned down the gas and left them she found Peter, still dressed, waiting on the stairs. “I say, Ruth, what's up?” he asked. “Don't ask me no questions and I won't tell you no lies,” the red-headed Ruth replied. “You'll know soon enough.” Late that night Mother came up and kissed all three children as they lay asleep. But Roberta was the only one whom the kiss woke, and she lay mousey-still, and said nothing. “If Mother doesn't want us to know she's been crying,” she said to herself as she heard through the dark the catching of her Mother's breath, “we WON'T know it. That's all.” When they came down to breakfast the next morning, Mother had already gone out. “To London,” Ruth said, and left them to their breakfast. “There's something awful the matter,” said Peter, breaking his egg. “Ruth told me last night we should know soon enough.” “Did you ASK her?” said Roberta, with scorn. “Yes, I did!” said Peter, angrily. “If you could go to bed without caring whether Mother was worried or not, I couldn't. So there.” “I don't think we ought to ask the servants things Mother doesn't tell us,” said Roberta. “That's right, Miss Goody-goody,” said Peter, “preach away.” “I'M not goody,” said Phyllis, “but I think Bobbie's right this time.” “Of course. She always is. In her own opinion,” said Peter. “Oh, DON'T!” cried Roberta, putting down her egg-spoon; “don't let's be horrid to each other. I'm sure some dire calamity is happening. Don't let's make it worse!” “Who began, I should like to know?” said Peter. Roberta made an effort, and answered:,  “I did, I suppose, but, ” “Well, then,” said Peter, triumphantly. But before he went to school he thumped his sister between the shoulders and told her to cheer up. The children came home to one o'clock dinner, but Mother was not there. And she was not there at tea-time. It was nearly seven before she came in, looking so ill and tired that the children felt they could not ask her any questions. She sank into an arm-chair. Phyllis took the long pins out of her hat, while Roberta took off her gloves, and Peter unfastened her walking-shoes and fetched her soft velvety slippers for her. When she had had a cup of tea, and Roberta had put eau-de-Cologne on her poor head that ached, Mother said:,  “Now, my darlings, I want to tell you something. Those men last night did bring very bad news, and Father will be away for some time. I am very worried about it, and I want you all to help me, and not to make things harder for me.” “As if we would!” said Roberta, holding Mother's hand against her face. “You can help me very much,” said Mother, “by being good and happy and not quarrelling when I'm away”, Roberta and Peter exchanged guilty glances, “for I shall have to be away a good deal.” “We won't quarrel. Indeed we won't,” said everybody. And meant it, too. “Then,” Mother went on, “I want you not to ask me any questions about this trouble; and not to ask anybody else any questions.” Peter cringed and shuffled his boots on the carpet. “You'll promise this, too, won't you?” said Mother. “I did ask Ruth,” said Peter, suddenly. “I'm very sorry, but I did.” “And what did she say?” “She said I should know soon enough.” “It isn't necessary for you to know anything about it,” said Mother; “it's about business, and you never do understand business, do you?” “No,” said Roberta; “is it something to do with Government?” For Father was in a Government Office. “Yes,” said Mother. “Now it's bed-time, my darlings. And don't YOU worry. It'll all come right in the end.” “Then don't YOU worry either, Mother,” said Phyllis, “and we'll all be as good as gold.” Mother sighed and kissed them. “We'll begin being good the first thing tomorrow morning,” said Peter, as they went upstairs. “Why not NOW?” said Roberta. “There's nothing to be good ABOUT now, silly,” said Peter. “We might begin to try to FEEL good,” said Phyllis, “and not call names.” “Who's calling names?” said Peter. “Bobbie knows right enough that when I say 'silly', it's just the same as if I said Bobbie.” “WELL,” said Roberta. “No, I don't mean what you mean. I mean it's just a, what is it Father calls it?, a germ of endearment! Good night.” The girls folded up their clothes with more than usual neatness, which was the only way of being good that they could think of. “I say,” said Phyllis, smoothing out her pinafore, “you used to say it was so dull, nothing happening, like in books. Now something HAS happened.” “I never wanted things to happen to make Mother unhappy,” said Roberta. “Everything's perfectly horrid.” Everything continued to be perfectly horrid for some weeks. Mother was nearly always out. Meals were dull and dirty. The between-maid was sent away, and Aunt Emma came on a visit. Aunt Emma was much older than Mother. She was going abroad to be a governess. She was very busy getting her clothes ready, and they were very ugly, dingy clothes, and she had them always littering about, and the sewing-machine seemed to whir, on and on all day and most of the night. Aunt Emma believed in keeping children in their proper places. And they more than returned the compliment. Their idea of Aunt Emma's proper place was anywhere where they were not. So they saw very little of her. They preferred the company of the servants, who were more amusing. Cook, if in a good temper, could sing comic songs, and the housemaid, if she happened not to be offended with you, could imitate a hen that has laid an egg, a bottle of champagne being opened, and could mew like two cats fighting. The servants never told the children what the bad news was that the gentlemen had brought to Father. But they kept hinting that they could tell a great deal if they chose, and this was not comfortable. One day when Peter had made a booby trap over the bath-room door, and it had acted beautifully as Ruth passed through, that red-haired parlour-maid caught him and boxed his ears. “You'll come to a bad end,” she said furiously, “you nasty little limb, you! If you don't mend your ways, you'll go where your precious Father's gone, so I tell you straight!” Roberta repeated this to her Mother, and next day Ruth was sent away. Then came the time when Mother came home and went to bed and stayed there two days and the Doctor came, and the children crept wretchedly about the house and wondered if the world was coming to an end. Mother came down one morning to breakfast, very pale and with lines on her face that used not to be there. And she smiled, as well as she could, and said:,  “Now, my pets, everything is settled. We're going to leave this house, and go and live in the country. Such a ducky dear little white house. I know you'll love it.” A whirling week of packing followed, not just packing clothes, like when you go to the seaside, but packing chairs and tables, covering their tops with sacking and their legs with straw. All sorts of things were packed that you don't pack when you go to the seaside. Crockery, blankets, candlesticks, carpets, bedsteads, saucepans, and even fenders and fire-irons. The house was like a furniture warehouse. I think the children enjoyed it very much. Mother was very busy, but not too busy now to talk to them, and read to them, and even to make a bit of poetry for Phyllis to cheer her up when she fell down with a screwdriver and ran it into her hand. “Aren't you going to pack this, Mother?” Roberta asked, pointing to the beautiful cabinet inlaid with red turtleshell and brass. “We can't take everything,” said Mother. “But we seem to be taking all the ugly things,” said Roberta. “We're taking the useful ones,” said Mother; “we've got to play at being Poor for a bit, my chickabiddy.” When all the ugly useful things had been packed up and taken away in a van by men in green-baize aprons, the two girls and Mother and Aunt Emma slept in the two spare rooms where the furniture was all pretty. All their beds had gone. A bed was made up for Peter on the drawing-room sofa. “I say, this is larks,” he said, wriggling joyously, as Mother tucked him up. “I do like moving! I wish we moved once a month.” Mother laughed. “I don't!” she said. “Good night, Peterkin.” As she turned away Roberta saw her face. She never forgot it. “Oh, Mother,” she whispered all to herself as she got into bed, “how brave you are! How I love you! Fancy being brave enough to laugh when you're feeling like THAT!” Next day boxes were filled, and boxes and more boxes; and then late in the afternoon a cab came to take them to the station. Aunt Emma saw them off. They felt that THEY were seeing HER off, and they were glad of it. “But, oh, those poor little foreign children that she's going to governess!” whispered Phyllis. “I wouldn't be them for anything!” At first they enjoyed looking out of the window, but when it grew dusk they grew sleepier and sleepier, and no one knew how long they had been in the train when they were roused by Mother's shaking them gently and saying:,  “Wake up, dears. We're there.” They woke up, cold and melancholy, and stood shivering on the draughty platform while the baggage was taken out of the train. Then the engine, puffing and blowing, set to work again, and dragged the train away. The children watched the tail-lights of the guard's van disappear into the darkness. This was the first train the children saw on that railway which was in time to become so very dear to them. They did not guess then how they would grow to love the railway, and how soon it would become the centre of their new life, nor what wonders and changes it would bring to them. They only shivered and sneezed and hoped the walk to the new house would not be long. Peter's nose was colder than he ever remembered it to have been before. Roberta's hat was crooked, and the elastic seemed tighter than usual. Phyllis's shoe-laces had come undone. “Come,” said Mother, “we've got to walk. There aren't any cabs here.” The walk was dark and muddy. The children stumbled a little on the rough road, and once Phyllis absently fell into a puddle, and was picked up damp and unhappy. There were no gas-lamps on the road, and the road was uphill. The cart went at a foot's pace, and they followed the gritty crunch of its wheels. As their eyes got used to the darkness, they could see the mound of boxes swaying dimly in front of them. A long gate had to be opened for the cart to pass through, and after that the road seemed to go across fields, and now it went down hill. Presently a great dark lumpish thing showed over to the right. “There's the house,” said Mother. “I wonder why she's shut the shutters.” “Who's SHE?” asked Roberta. “The woman I engaged to clean the place, and put the furniture straight and get supper.” There was a low wall, and trees inside. “That's the garden,” said Mother. “It looks more like a dripping-pan full of black cabbages,” said Peter. The cart went on along by the garden wall, and round to the back of the house, and here it clattered into a cobble-stoned yard and stopped at the back door. There was no light in any of the windows. Everyone hammered at the door, but no one came. The man who drove the cart said he expected Mrs. Viney had gone home. “You see your train was that late,” said he. “But she's got the key,” said Mother. “What are we to do?” “Oh, she'll have left that under the doorstep,” said the cart man; “folks do hereabouts.” He took the lantern off his cart and stooped. “Ay, here it is, right enough,” he said. He unlocked the door and went in and set his lantern on the table. “Got e'er a candle?” said he. “I don't know where anything is.” Mother spoke rather less cheerfully than usual. He struck a match. There was a candle on the table, and he lighted it. By its thin little glimmer the children saw a large bare kitchen with a stone floor. There were no curtains, no hearth-rug. The kitchen table from home stood in the middle of the room. The chairs were in one corner, and the pots, pans, brooms, and crockery in another. There was no fire, and the black grate showed cold, dead ashes. As the cart man turned to go out after he had brought in the boxes, there was a rustling, scampering sound that seemed to come from inside the walls of the house. “Oh, what's that?” cried the girls. “It's only the rats,” said the cart man. And he went away and shut the door, and the sudden draught of it blew out the candle. “Oh, dear,” said Phyllis, “I wish we hadn't come!” and she knocked a chair over. “ONLY the rats!” said Peter, in the dark. Chapter II. Peter's coal-mine. “What fun!” said Mother, in the dark, feeling for the matches on the table. “How frightened the poor mice were, I don't believe they were rats at all.” She struck a match and relighted the candle and everyone looked at each other by its winky, blinky light. “Well,” she said, “you've often wanted something to happen and now it has. This is quite an adventure, isn't it? I told Mrs. Viney to get us some bread and butter, and meat and things, and to have supper ready. I suppose she's laid it in the dining-room. So let's go and see.” The dining-room opened out of the kitchen. It looked much darker than the kitchen when they went in with the one candle. Because the kitchen was whitewashed, but the dining-room was dark wood from floor to ceiling, and across the ceiling there were heavy black beams. There was a muddled maze of dusty furniture, the breakfast-room furniture from the old home where they had lived all their lives. It seemed a very long time ago, and a very long way off. There was the table certainly, and there were chairs, but there was no supper. “Let's look in the other rooms,” said Mother; and they looked. And in each room was the same kind of blundering half-arrangement of furniture, and fire-irons and crockery, and all sorts of odd things on the floor, but there was nothing to eat; even in the pantry there were only a rusty cake-tin and a broken plate with whitening mixed in it. “What a horrid old woman!” said Mother; “she's just walked off with the money and not got us anything to eat at all.” “Then shan't we have any supper at all?” asked Phyllis, dismayed, stepping back on to a soap-dish that cracked responsively. “Oh, yes,” said Mother, “only it'll mean unpacking one of those big cases that we put in the cellar. Phil, do mind where you're walking to, there's a dear. Peter, hold the light.” The cellar door opened out of the kitchen. There were five wooden steps leading down. It wasn't a proper cellar at all, the children thought, because its ceiling went up as high as the kitchen's. A bacon-rack hung under its ceiling. There was wood in it, and coal. Also the big cases. Peter held the candle, all on one side, while Mother tried to open the great packing-case. It was very securely nailed down. “Where's the hammer?” asked Peter. “That's just it,” said Mother. “I'm afraid it's inside the box. But there's a coal-shovel, and there's the kitchen poker.” And with these she tried to get the case open. “Let me do it,” said Peter, thinking he could do it better himself. Everyone thinks this when he sees another person stirring a fire, or opening a box, or untying a knot in a bit of string. “You'll hurt your hands, Mammy,” said Roberta; “let me.” “I wish Father was here,” said Phyllis; “he'd get it open in two shakes. What are you kicking me for, Bobbie?” “I wasn't,” said Roberta. Just then the first of the long nails in the packing-case began to come out with a scrunch. Then a lath was raised and then another, till all four stood up with the long nails in them shining fiercely like iron teeth in the candle-light. “Hooray!” said Mother; “here are some candles, the very first thing! You girls go and light them. You'll find some saucers and things. Just drop a little candle-grease in the saucer and stick the candle upright in it.” “How many shall we light?” “As many as ever you like,” said Mother, gaily. “The great thing is to be cheerful. Nobody can be cheerful in the dark except owls and dormice.” So the girls lighted candles. The head of the first match flew off and stuck to Phyllis's finger; but, as Roberta said, it was only a little burn, and she might have had to be a Roman martyr and be burned whole if she had happened to live in the days when those things were fashionable. Then, when the dining-room was lighted by fourteen candles, Roberta fetched coal and wood and lighted a fire. “It's very cold for May,” she said, feeling what a grown-up thing it was to say. The fire-light and the candle-light made the dining-room look very different, for now you could see that the dark walls were of wood, carved here and there into little wreaths and loops. The girls hastily 'tidied' the room, which meant putting the chairs against the wall, and piling all the odds and ends into a corner and partly hiding them with the big leather arm-chair that Father used to sit in after dinner. “Bravo!” cried Mother, coming in with a tray full of things. “This is something like! I'll just get a tablecloth and then, ” The tablecloth was in a box with a proper lock that was opened with a key and not with a shovel, and when the cloth was spread on the table, a real feast was laid out on it. Everyone was very, very tired, but everyone cheered up at the sight of the funny and delightful supper. There were biscuits, the Marie and the plain kind, sardines, preserved ginger, cooking raisins, and candied peel and marmalade. “What a good thing Aunt Emma packed up all the odds and ends out of the Store cupboard,” said Mother. “Now, Phil, DON'T put the marmalade spoon in among the sardines.” “No, I won't, Mother,” said Phyllis, and put it down among the Marie biscuits. “Let's drink Aunt Emma's health,” said Roberta, suddenly; “what should we have done if she hadn't packed up these things? Here's to Aunt Emma!” And the toast was drunk in ginger wine and water, out of willow-patterned tea-cups, because the glasses couldn't be found. They all felt that they had been a little hard on Aunt Emma. She wasn't a nice cuddly person like Mother, but after all it was she who had thought of packing up the odds and ends of things to eat. It was Aunt Emma, too, who had aired all the sheets ready; and the men who had moved the furniture had put the bedsteads together, so the beds were soon made. “Good night, chickies,” said Mother. “I'm sure there aren't any rats. But I'll leave my door open, and then if a mouse comes, you need only scream, and I'll come and tell it exactly what I think of it.” Then she went to her own room. Roberta woke to hear the little travelling clock chime two. It sounded like a church clock ever so far away, she always thought. And she heard, too, Mother still moving about in her room. Next morning Roberta woke Phyllis by pulling her hair gently, but quite enough for her purpose. “Wassermarrer?” asked Phyllis, still almost wholly asleep. “Wake up! wake up!” said Roberta. “We're in the new house, don't you remember? No servants or anything. Let's get up and begin to be useful. We'll just creep down mouse-quietly, and have everything beautiful before Mother gets up. I've woke Peter. He'll be dressed as soon as we are.” So they dressed quietly and quickly. Of course, there was no water in their room, so when they got down they washed as much as they thought was necessary under the spout of the pump in the yard. One pumped and the other washed. It was splashy but interesting. “It's much more fun than basin washing,” said Roberta. “How sparkly the weeds are between the stones, and the moss on the roof, oh, and the flowers!” The roof of the back kitchen sloped down quite low. It was made of thatch and it had moss on it, and house-leeks and stonecrop and wallflowers, and even a clump of purple flag-flowers, at the far corner. “This is far, far, far and away prettier than Edgecombe Villa,” said Phyllis. “I wonder what the garden's like.” “We mustn't think of the garden yet,” said Roberta, with earnest energy. “Let's go in and begin to work.” They lighted the fire and put the kettle on, and they arranged the crockery for breakfast; they could not find all the right things, but a glass ash-tray made an excellent salt-cellar, and a newish baking-tin seemed as if it would do to put bread on, if they had any. When there seemed to be nothing more that they could do, they went out again into the fresh bright morning. “We'll go into the garden now,” said Peter. But somehow they couldn't find the garden. They went round the house and round the house. The yard occupied the back, and across it were stables and outbuildings. On the other three sides the house stood simply in a field, without a yard of garden to divide it from the short smooth turf. And yet they had certainly seen the garden wall the night before. It was a hilly country. Down below they could see the line of the railway, and the black yawning mouth of a tunnel. The station was out of sight. There was a great bridge with tall arches running across one end of the valley. “Never mind the garden,” said Peter; “let's go down and look at the railway. There might be trains passing.” “We can see them from here,” said Roberta, slowly; “let's sit down a bit.” So they all sat down on a great flat grey stone that had pushed itself up out of the grass; it was one of many that lay about on the hillside, and when Mother came out to look for them at eight o'clock, she found them deeply asleep in a contented, sun-warmed bunch. They had made an excellent fire, and had set the kettle on it at about half-past five. So that by eight the fire had been out for some time, the water had all boiled away, and the bottom was burned out of the kettle. Also they had not thought of washing the crockery before they set the table. “But it doesn't matter, the cups and saucers, I mean,” said Mother. “Because I've found another room, I'd quite forgotten there was one. And it's magic! And I've boiled the water for tea in a saucepan.” The forgotten room opened out of the kitchen. In the agitation and half darkness the night before its door had been mistaken for a cupboard's. It was a little square room, and on its table, all nicely set out, was a joint of cold roast beef, with bread, butter, cheese, and a pie. “Pie for breakfast!” cried Peter; “how perfectly ripping!” “It isn't pigeon-pie,” said Mother; “it's only apple. Well, this is the supper we ought to have had last night. And there was a note from Mrs. Viney. Her son-in-law has broken his arm, and she had to get home early. She's coming this morning at ten.” That was a wonderful breakfast. It is unusual to begin the day with cold apple pie, but the children all said they would rather have it than meat. “You see it's more like dinner than breakfast to us,” said Peter, passing his plate for more, “because we were up so early.” The day passed in helping Mother to unpack and arrange things. Six small legs quite ached with running about while their owners carried clothes and crockery and all sorts of things to their proper places. It was not till quite late in the afternoon that Mother said:,  “There! That'll do for to-day. I'll lie down for an hour, so as to be as fresh as a lark by supper-time.” Then they all looked at each other. Each of the three expressive countenances expressed the same thought. That thought was double, and consisted, like the bits of information in the Child's Guide to Knowledge, of a question and an answer. Q. Where shall we go? A. To the railway. So to the railway they went, and as soon as they started for the railway they saw where the garden had hidden itself. It was right behind the stables, and it had a high wall all round. “Oh, never mind about the garden now!” cried Peter. “Mother told me this morning where it was. It'll keep till to-morrow. Let's get to the railway.” The way to the railway was all down hill over smooth, short turf with here and there furze bushes and grey and yellow rocks sticking out like candied peel from the top of a cake. The way ended in a steep run and a wooden fence, and there was the railway with the shining metals and the telegraph wires and posts and signals. They all climbed on to the top of the fence, and then suddenly there was a rumbling sound that made them look along the line to the right, where the dark mouth of a tunnel opened itself in the face of a rocky cliff; next moment a train had rushed out of the tunnel with a shriek and a snort, and had slid noisily past them. They felt the rush of its passing, and the pebbles on the line jumped and rattled under it as it went by. “Oh!” said Roberta, drawing a long breath; “it was like a great dragon tearing by. Did you feel it fan us with its hot wings?” “I suppose a dragon's lair might look very like that tunnel from the outside,” said Phyllis. But Peter said:,  “I never thought we should ever get as near to a train as this. It's the most ripping sport!” “Better than toy-engines, isn't it?” said Roberta. (I am tired of calling Roberta by her name. I don't see why I should. No one else did. Everyone else called her Bobbie, and I don't see why I shouldn't.) “I don't know; it's different,” said Peter. “It seems so odd to see ALL of a train. It's awfully tall, isn't it?” “We've always seen them cut in half by platforms,” said Phyllis. “I wonder if that train was going to London,” Bobbie said. “London's where Father is.” “Let's go down to the station and find out,” said Peter. So they went. They walked along the edge of the line, and heard the telegraph wires humming over their heads. When you are in the train, it seems such a little way between post and post, and one after another the posts seem to catch up the wires almost more quickly than you can count them. But when you have to walk, the posts seem few and far between. But the children got to the station at last. Never before had any of them been at a station, except for the purpose of catching trains, or perhaps waiting for them, and always with grown-ups in attendance, grown-ups who were not themselves interested in stations, except as places from which they wished to get away. Never before had they passed close enough to a signal-box to be able to notice the wires, and to hear the mysterious 'ping, ping,' followed by the strong, firm clicking of machinery. The very sleepers on which the rails lay were a delightful path to travel by, just far enough apart to serve as the stepping-stones in a game of foaming torrents hastily organised by Bobbie. Then to arrive at the station, not through the booking office, but in a freebooting sort of way by the sloping end of the platform. This in itself was joy. Joy, too, it was to peep into the porters' room, where the lamps are, and the Railway almanac on the wall, and one porter half asleep behind a paper. There were a great many crossing lines at the station; some of them just ran into a yard and stopped short, as though they were tired of business and meant to retire for good. Trucks stood on the rails here, and on one side was a great heap of coal, not a loose heap, such as you see in your coal cellar, but a sort of solid building of coals with large square blocks of coal outside used just as though they were bricks, and built up till the heap looked like the picture of the Cities of the Plain in 'Bible Stories for Infants.' There was a line of whitewash near the top of the coaly wall. When presently the Porter lounged out of his room at the twice-repeated tingling thrill of a gong over the station door, Peter said, “How do you do?” in his best manner, and hastened to ask what the white mark was on the coal for. “To mark how much coal there be,” said the Porter, “so as we'll know if anyone nicks it. So don't you go off with none in your pockets, young gentleman!” This seemed, at the time but a merry jest, and Peter felt at once that the Porter was a friendly sort with no nonsense about him. But later the words came back to Peter with a new meaning. Have you ever gone into a farmhouse kitchen on a baking day, and seen the great crock of dough set by the fire to rise? If you have, and if you were at that time still young enough to be interested in everything you saw, you will remember that you found yourself quite unable to resist the temptation to poke your finger into the soft round of dough that curved inside the pan like a giant mushroom. And you will remember that your finger made a dent in the dough, and that slowly, but quite surely, the dent disappeared, and the dough looked quite the same as it did before you touched it. Unless, of course, your hand was extra dirty, in which case, naturally, there would be a little black mark. Well, it was just like that with the sorrow the children had felt at Father's going away, and at Mother's being so unhappy. It made a deep impression, but the impression did not last long. They soon got used to being without Father, though they did not forget him; and they got used to not going to school, and to seeing very little of Mother, who was now almost all day shut up in her upstairs room writing, writing, writing. She used to come down at tea-time and read aloud the stories she had written. They were lovely stories. The rocks and hills and valleys and trees, the canal, and above all, the railway, were so new and so perfectly pleasing that the remembrance of the old life in the villa grew to seem almost like a dream. Mother had told them more than once that they were 'quite poor now,' but this did not seem to be anything but a way of speaking. Grown-up people, even Mothers, often make remarks that don't seem to mean anything in particular, just for the sake of saying something, seemingly. There was always enough to eat, and they wore the same kind of nice clothes they had always worn. But in June came three wet days; the rain came down, straight as lances, and it was very, very cold. Nobody could go out, and everybody shivered. They all went up to the door of Mother's room and knocked. “Well, what is it?” asked Mother from inside. “Mother,” said Bobbie, “mayn't I light a fire? I do know how.” And Mother said: “No, my ducky-love. We mustn't have fires in June, coal is so dear. If you're cold, go and have a good romp in the attic. That'll warm you.” “But, Mother, it only takes such a very little coal to make a fire.” “It's more than we can afford, chickeny-love,” said Mother, cheerfully. “Now run away, there's darlings, I'm madly busy!” “Mother's always busy now,” said Phyllis, in a whisper to Peter. Peter did not answer. He shrugged his shoulders. He was thinking. Thought, however, could not long keep itself from the suitable furnishing of a bandit's lair in the attic. Peter was the bandit, of course. Bobbie was his lieutenant, his band of trusty robbers, and, in due course, the parent of Phyllis, who was the captured maiden for whom a magnificent ransom, in horse-beans, was unhesitatingly paid. They all went down to tea flushed and joyous as any mountain brigands. But when Phyllis was going to add jam to her bread and butter, Mother said:,  “Jam OR butter, dear, not jam AND butter. We can't afford that sort of reckless luxury nowadays.” Phyllis finished the slice of bread and butter in silence, and followed it up by bread and jam. Peter mingled thought and weak tea. After tea they went back to the attic and he said to his sisters:,  “I have an idea.” “What's that?” they asked politely. “I shan't tell you,” was Peter's unexpected rejoinder. “Oh, very well,” said Bobbie; and Phil said, “Don't, then.” “Girls,” said Peter, “are always so hasty tempered.” “I should like to know what boys are?” said Bobbie, with fine disdain. “I don't want to know about your silly ideas.” “You'll know some day,” said Peter, keeping his own temper by what looked exactly like a miracle; “if you hadn't been so keen on a row, I might have told you about it being only noble-heartedness that made me not tell you my idea. But now I shan't tell you anything at all about it, so there!” And it was, indeed, some time before he could be induced to say anything, and when he did it wasn't much. He said:,  “The only reason why I won't tell you my idea that I'm going to do is because it MAY be wrong, and I don't want to drag you into it.” “Don't you do it if it's wrong, Peter,” said Bobbie; “let me do it.” But Phyllis said:,  “ I  should like to do wrong if YOU'RE going to!” “No,” said Peter, rather touched by this devotion; “it's a forlorn hope, and I'm going to lead it. All I ask is that if Mother asks where I am, you won't blab.” “We haven't got anything TO blab,” said Bobbie, indignantly. “Oh, yes, you have!” said Peter, dropping horse-beans through his fingers. “I've trusted you to the death. You know I'm going to do a lone adventure, and some people might think it wrong, I don't. And if Mother asks where I am, say I'm playing at mines.” “What sort of mines?” “You just say mines.” “You might tell US, Pete.” “Well, then, COAL-mines. But don't you let the word pass your lips on pain of torture.” “You needn't threaten,” said Bobbie, “and I do think you might let us help.” “If I find a coal-mine, you shall help cart the coal,” Peter condescended to promise. “Keep your secret if you like,” said Phyllis. “Keep it if you CAN,” said Bobbie. “I'll keep it, right enough,” said Peter. Between tea and supper there is an interval even in the most greedily regulated families. At this time Mother was usually writing, and Mrs. Viney had gone home. Two nights after the dawning of Peter's idea he beckoned the girls mysteriously at the twilight hour. “Come hither with me,” he said, “and bring the Roman Chariot.” The Roman Chariot was a very old perambulator that had spent years of retirement in the loft over the coach-house. The children had oiled its works till it glided noiseless as a pneumatic bicycle, and answered to the helm as it had probably done in its best days. “Follow your dauntless leader,” said Peter, and led the way down the hill towards the station. Just above the station many rocks have pushed their heads out through the turf as though they, like the children, were interested in the railway. In a little hollow between three rocks lay a heap of dried brambles and heather. Peter halted, turned over the brushwood with a well-scarred boot, and said:,  “Here's the first coal from the St. Peter's Mine. We'll take it home in the chariot. Punctuality and despatch. All orders carefully attended to. Any shaped lump cut to suit regular customers.” The chariot was packed full of coal. And when it was packed it had to be unpacked again because it was so heavy that it couldn't be got up the hill by the three children, not even when Peter harnessed himself to the handle with his braces, and firmly grasping his waistband in one hand pulled while the girls pushed behind. Three journeys had to be made before the coal from Peter's mine was added to the heap of Mother's coal in the cellar. Afterwards Peter went out alone, and came back very black and mysterious. “I've been to my coal-mine,” he said; “to-morrow evening we'll bring home the black diamonds in the chariot.” It was a week later that Mrs. Viney remarked to Mother how well this last lot of coal was holding out. The children hugged themselves and each other in complicated wriggles of silent laughter as they listened on the stairs. They had all forgotten by now that there had ever been any doubt in Peter's mind as to whether coal-mining was wrong. But there came a dreadful night when the Station Master put on a pair of old sand shoes that he had worn at the seaside in his summer holiday, and crept out very quietly to the yard where the Sodom and Gomorrah heap of coal was, with the whitewashed line round it. He crept out there, and he waited like a cat by a mousehole. On the top of the heap something small and dark was scrabbling and rattling furtively among the coal. The Station Master concealed himself in the shadow of a brake-van that had a little tin chimney and was labelled:,       G. N. and S. R.           34576     Return at once to   White Heather Sidings and in this concealment he lurked till the small thing on the top of the heap ceased to scrabble and rattle, came to the edge of the heap, cautiously let itself down, and lifted something after it. Then the arm of the Station Master was raised, the hand of the Station Master fell on a collar, and there was Peter firmly held by the jacket, with an old carpenter's bag full of coal in his trembling clutch. “So I've caught you at last, have I, you young thief?” said the Station Master. “I'm not a thief,” said Peter, as firmly as he could. “I'm a coal-miner.” “Tell that to the Marines,” said the Station Master. “It would be just as true whoever I told it to,” said Peter. “You're right there,” said the man, who held him. “Stow your jaw, you young rip, and come along to the station.” “Oh, no,” cried in the darkness an agonised voice that was not Peter's. “Not the POLICE station!” said another voice from the darkness. “Not yet,” said the Station Master. “The Railway Station first. Why, it's a regular gang. Any more of you?” “Only us,” said Bobbie and Phyllis, coming out of the shadow of another truck labelled Staveley Colliery, and bearing on it the legend in white chalk: 'Wanted in No. 1 Road.' “What do you mean by spying on a fellow like this?” said Peter, angrily. “Time someone did spy on you,  I  think,” said the Station Master. “Come along to the station.” “Oh, DON'T!” said Bobbie. “Can't you decide NOW what you'll do to us? It's our fault just as much as Peter's. We helped to carry the coal away, and we knew where he got it.” “No, you didn't,” said Peter. “Yes, we did,” said Bobbie. “We knew all the time. We only pretended we didn't just to humour you.” Peter's cup was full. He had mined for coal, he had struck coal, he had been caught, and now he learned that his sisters had 'humoured' him. “Don't hold me!” he said. “I won't run away.” The Station Master loosed Peter's collar, struck a match and looked at them by its flickering light. “Why,” said he, “you're the children from the Three Chimneys up yonder. So nicely dressed, too. Tell me now, what made you do such a thing? Haven't you ever been to church or learned your catechism or anything, not to know it's wicked to steal?” He spoke much more gently now, and Peter said:,  “I didn't think it was stealing. I was almost sure it wasn't. I thought if I took it from the outside part of the heap, perhaps it would be. But in the middle I thought I could fairly count it only mining. It'll take thousands of years for you to burn up all that coal and get to the middle parts.” “Not quite. But did you do it for a lark or what?” “Not much lark carting that beastly heavy stuff up the hill,” said Peter, indignantly. “Then why did you?” The Station Master's voice was so much kinder now that Peter replied:,  “You know that wet day? Well, Mother said we were too poor to have a fire. We always had fires when it was cold at our other house, and, ” “DON'T!” interrupted Bobbie, in a whisper. “Well,” said the Station Master, rubbing his chin thoughtfully, “I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll look over it this once. But you remember, young gentleman, stealing is stealing, and what's mine isn't yours, whether you call it mining or whether you don't. Run along home.” “Do you mean you aren't going to do anything to us? Well, you are a brick,” said Peter, with enthusiasm. “You're a dear,” said Bobbie. “You're a darling,” said Phyllis. “That's all right,” said the Station Master. And on this they parted. “Don't speak to me,” said Peter, as the three went up the hill. “You're spies and traitors, that's what you are.” But the girls were too glad to have Peter between them, safe and free, and on the way to Three Chimneys and not to the Police Station, to mind much what he said. “We DID say it was us as much as you,” said Bobbie, gently. “Well, and it wasn't.” “It would have come to the same thing in Courts with judges,” said Phyllis. “Don't be snarky, Peter. It isn't our fault your secrets are so jolly easy to find out.” She took his arm, and he let her. “There's an awful lot of coal in the cellar, anyhow,” he went on. “Oh, don't!” said Bobbie. “I don't think we ought to be glad about THAT.” “I don't know,” said Peter, plucking up a spirit. “I'm not at all sure, even now, that mining is a crime.” But the girls were quite sure. And they were also quite sure that he was quite sure, however little he cared to own it. Chapter III. The old gentleman. After the adventure of Peter's Coal-mine, it seemed well to the children to keep away from the station, but they did not, they could not, keep away from the railway. They had lived all their lives in a street where cabs and omnibuses rumbled by at all hours, and the carts of butchers and bakers and candlestick makers (I never saw a candlestick-maker's cart; did you?) might occur at any moment. Here in the deep silence of the sleeping country the only things that went by were the trains. They seemed to be all that was left to link the children to the old life that had once been theirs. Straight down the hill in front of Three Chimneys the daily passage of their six feet began to mark a path across the crisp, short turf. They began to know the hours when certain trains passed, and they gave names to them. The 9.15 up was called the Green Dragon. The 10.7 down was the Worm of Wantley. The midnight town express, whose shrieking rush they sometimes woke from their dreams to hear, was the Fearsome Fly-by-night. Peter got up once, in chill starshine, and, peeping at it through his curtains, named it on the spot. It was by the Green Dragon that the old gentleman travelled. He was a very nice-looking old gentleman, and he looked as if he were nice, too, which is not at all the same thing. He had a fresh-coloured, clean-shaven face and white hair, and he wore rather odd-shaped collars and a top-hat that wasn't exactly the same kind as other people's. Of course the children didn't see all this at first. In fact the first thing they noticed about the old gentleman was his hand. It was one morning as they sat on the fence waiting for the Green Dragon, which was three and a quarter minutes late by Peter's Waterbury watch that he had had given him on his last birthday. “The Green Dragon's going where Father is,” said Phyllis; “if it were a really real dragon, we could stop it and ask it to take our love to Father.” “Dragons don't carry people's love,” said Peter; “they'd be above it.” “Yes, they do, if you tame them thoroughly first. They fetch and carry like pet spaniels,” said Phyllis, “and feed out of your hand. I wonder why Father never writes to us.” “Mother says he's been too busy,” said Bobbie; “but he'll write soon, she says.” “I say,” Phyllis suggested, “let's all wave to the Green Dragon as it goes by. If it's a magic dragon, it'll understand and take our loves to Father. And if it isn't, three waves aren't much. We shall never miss them.” So when the Green Dragon tore shrieking out of the mouth of its dark lair, which was the tunnel, all three children stood on the railing and waved their pocket-handkerchiefs without stopping to think whether they were clean handkerchiefs or the reverse. They were, as a matter of fact, very much the reverse. And out of a first-class carriage a hand waved back. A quite clean hand. It held a newspaper. It was the old gentleman's hand. After this it became the custom for waves to be exchanged between the children and the 9.15. And the children, especially the girls, liked to think that perhaps the old gentleman knew Father, and would meet him 'in business,' wherever that shady retreat might be, and tell him how his three children stood on a rail far away in the green country and waved their love to him every morning, wet or fine. For they were now able to go out in all sorts of weather such as they would never have been allowed to go out in when they lived in their villa house. This was Aunt Emma's doing, and the children felt more and more that they had not been quite fair to this unattractive aunt, when they found how useful were the long gaiters and waterproof coats that they had laughed at her for buying for them. Mother, all this time, was very busy with her writing. She used to send off a good many long blue envelopes with stories in them, and large envelopes of different sizes and colours used to come to her. Sometimes she would sigh when she opened them and say:,  “Another story come home to roost. Oh, dear, Oh, dear!” and then the children would be very sorry. But sometimes she would wave the envelope in the air and say:, “Hooray, hooray. Here's a sensible Editor. He's taken my story and this is the proof of it.” At first the children thought 'the Proof' meant the letter the sensible Editor had written, but they presently got to know that the proof was long slips of paper with the story printed on them. Whenever an Editor was sensible there were buns for tea. One day Peter was going down to the village to get buns to celebrate the sensibleness of the Editor of the Children's Globe, when he met the Station Master. Peter felt very uncomfortable, for he had now had time to think over the affair of the coal-mine. He did not like to say “Good morning” to the Station Master, as you usually do to anyone you meet on a lonely road, because he had a hot feeling, which spread even to his ears, that the Station Master might not care to speak to a person who had stolen coals. 'Stolen' is a nasty word, but Peter felt it was the right one. So he looked down, and said Nothing. It was the Station Master who said “Good morning” as he passed by. And Peter answered, “Good morning.” Then he thought:,  “Perhaps he doesn't know who I am by daylight, or he wouldn't be so polite.” And he did not like the feeling which thinking this gave him. And then before he knew what he was going to do he ran after the Station Master, who stopped when he heard Peter's hasty boots crunching the road, and coming up with him very breathless and with his ears now quite magenta-coloured, he said:,  “I don't want you to be polite to me if you don't know me when you see me.” “Eh?” said the Station Master. “I thought perhaps you didn't know it was me that took the coals,”  Peter went on, “when you said 'Good morning.' But it was, and I'm sorry. There.” “Why,” said the Station Master, “I wasn't thinking anything at all about the precious coals. Let bygones be bygones. And where were you off to in such a hurry?” “I'm going to buy buns for tea,” said Peter. “I thought you were all so poor,” said the Station Master. “So we are,” said Peter, confidentially, “but we always have three pennyworth of halfpennies for tea whenever Mother sells a story or a poem or anything.” “Oh,” said the Station Master, “so your Mother writes stories, does she?” “The beautifulest you ever read,” said Peter. “You ought to be very proud to have such a clever Mother.” “Yes,” said Peter, “but she used to play with us more before she had to be so clever.” “Well,” said the Station Master, “I must be getting along. You give us a look in at the Station whenever you feel so inclined. And as to coals, it's a word that, well, oh, no, we never mention it, eh?” “Thank you,” said Peter. “I'm very glad it's all straightened out between us.” And he went on across the canal bridge to the village to get the buns, feeling more comfortable in his mind than he had felt since the hand of the Station Master had fastened on his collar that night among the coals. Next day when they had sent the threefold wave of greeting to Father by the Green Dragon, and the old gentleman had waved back as usual, Peter proudly led the way to the station. “But ought we?” said Bobbie. “After the coals, she means,” Phyllis explained. “I met the Station Master yesterday,” said Peter, in an offhand way, and he pretended not to hear what Phyllis had said; “he expresspecially invited us to go down any time we liked.” “After the coals?” repeated Phyllis. “Stop a minute, my bootlace is undone again.” “It always IS undone again,” said Peter, “and the Station Master was more of a gentleman than you'll ever be, Phil, throwing coal at a chap's head like that.” Phyllis did up her bootlace and went on in silence, but her shoulders shook, and presently a fat tear fell off her nose and splashed on the metal of the railway line. Bobbie saw it. “Why, what's the matter, darling?” she said, stopping short and putting her arm round the heaving shoulders. “He called me un-un-ungentlemanly,” sobbed Phyllis. “I didn't never call him unladylike, not even when he tied my Clorinda to the firewood bundle and burned her at the stake for a martyr.” Peter had indeed perpetrated this outrage a year or two before. “Well, you began, you know,” said Bobbie, honestly, “about coals and all that. Don't you think you'd better both unsay everything since the wave, and let honour be satisfied?” “I will if Peter will,” said Phyllis, sniffling. “All right,” said Peter; “honour is satisfied. Here, use my hankie, Phil, for goodness' sake, if you've lost yours as usual. I wonder what you do with them.” “You had my last one,” said Phyllis, indignantly, “to tie up the rabbit-hutch door with. But you're very ungrateful. It's quite right what it says in the poetry book about sharper than a serpent it is to have a toothless child, but it means ungrateful when it says toothless. Miss Lowe told me so.” “All right,” said Peter, impatiently, “I'm sorry. THERE! Now will you come on?” They reached the station and spent a joyous two hours with the Porter. He was a worthy man and seemed never tired of answering the questions that begin with “Why, ” which many people in higher ranks of life often seem weary of. He told them many things that they had not known before, as, for instance, that the things that hook carriages together are called couplings, and that the pipes like great serpents that hang over the couplings are meant to stop the train with. “If you could get a holt of one o' them when the train is going and pull 'em apart,” said he, “she'd stop dead off with a jerk.” “Who's she?” said Phyllis. “The train, of course,” said the Porter. After that the train was never again 'It' to the children. “And you know the thing in the carriages where it says on it, 'Five pounds' fine for improper use.' If you was to improperly use that, the train 'ud stop.” “And if you used it properly?” said Roberta. “It 'ud stop just the same, I suppose,” said he, “but it isn't proper use unless you're being murdered. There was an old lady once, someone kidded her on it was a refreshment-room bell, and she used it improper, not being in danger of her life, though hungry, and when the train stopped and the guard came along expecting to find someone weltering in their last moments, she says, 'Oh, please, Mister, I'll take a glass of stout and a bath bun,' she says. And the train was seven minutes behind her time as it was.” “What did the guard say to the old lady?” “ I  dunno,” replied the Porter, “but I lay she didn't forget it in a hurry, whatever it was.” In such delightful conversation the time went by all too quickly. The Station Master came out once or twice from that sacred inner temple behind the place where the hole is that they sell you tickets through, and was most jolly with them all. “Just as if coal had never been discovered,” Phyllis whispered to her sister. He gave them each an orange, and promised to take them up into the signal-box one of these days, when he wasn't so busy. Several trains went through the station, and Peter noticed for the first time that engines have numbers on them, like cabs. “Yes,” said the Porter, “I knowed a young gent as used to take down the numbers of every single one he seed; in a green note-book with silver corners it was, owing to his father being very well-to-do in the wholesale stationery.” Peter felt that he could take down numbers, too, even if he was not the son of a wholesale stationer. As he did not happen to have a green leather note-book with silver corners, the Porter gave him a yellow envelope and on it he noted:,       379      663 and felt that this was the beginning of what would be a most interesting collection. That night at tea he asked Mother if she had a green leather note-book with silver corners. She had not; but when she heard what he wanted it for she gave him a little black one. “It has a few pages torn out,” said she; “but it will hold quite a lot of numbers, and when it's full I'll give you another. I'm so glad you like the railway. Only, please, you mustn't walk on the line.” “Not if we face the way the train's coming?” asked Peter, after a gloomy pause, in which glances of despair were exchanged. “No, really not,” said Mother. Then Phyllis said, “Mother, didn't YOU ever walk on the railway lines when you were little?” Mother was an honest and honourable Mother, so she had to say, “Yes.” “Well, then,” said Phyllis. “But, darlings, you don't know how fond I am of you. What should I do if you got hurt?” “Are you fonder of us than Granny was of you when you were little?”  Phyllis asked. Bobbie made signs to her to stop, but Phyllis never did see signs, no matter how plain they might be. Mother did not answer for a minute. She got up to put more water in the teapot. “No one,” she said at last, “ever loved anyone more than my mother loved me.” Then she was quiet again, and Bobbie kicked Phyllis hard under the table, because Bobbie understood a little bit the thoughts that were making Mother so quiet, the thoughts of the time when Mother was a little girl and was all the world to HER mother. It seems so easy and natural to run to Mother when one is in trouble. Bobbie understood a little how people do not leave off running to their mothers when they are in trouble even when they are grown up, and she thought she knew a little what it must be to be sad, and have no mother to run to any more. So she kicked Phyllis, who said:,  “What are you kicking me like that for, Bob?” And then Mother laughed a little and sighed and said:,  “Very well, then. Only let me be sure you do know which way the trains come, and don't walk on the line near the tunnel or near corners.” “Trains keep to the left like carriages,” said Peter, “so if we keep to the right, we're bound to see them coming.” “Very well,” said Mother, and I dare say you think that she ought not to have said it. But she remembered about when she was a little girl herself, and she did say it, and neither her own children nor you nor any other children in the world could ever understand exactly what it cost her to do it. Only some few of you, like Bobbie, may understand a very little bit. It was the very next day that Mother had to stay in bed because her head ached so. Her hands were burning hot, and she would not eat anything, and her throat was very sore. “If I was you, Mum,” said Mrs. Viney, “I should take and send for the doctor. There's a lot of catchy complaints a-going about just now. My sister's eldest, she took a chill and it went to her inside, two years ago come Christmas, and she's never been the same gell since.” Mother wouldn't at first, but in the evening she felt so much worse that Peter was sent to the house in the village that had three laburnum trees by the gate, and on the gate a brass plate with W. W. Forrest, M.D., on it. W. W. Forrest, M.D., came at once. He talked to Peter on the way back. He seemed a most charming and sensible man, interested in railways, and rabbits, and really important things. When he had seen Mother, he said it was influenza. “Now, Lady Grave-airs,” he said in the hall to Bobbie, “I suppose you'll want to be head-nurse.” “Of course,” said she. “Well, then, I'll send down some medicine. Keep up a good fire. Have some strong beef tea made ready to give her as soon as the fever goes down. She can have grapes now, and beef essence, and soda-water and milk, and you'd better get in a bottle of brandy. The best brandy. Cheap brandy is worse than poison.” She asked him to write it all down, and he did. When Bobbie showed Mother the list he had written, Mother laughed. It WAS a laugh, Bobbie decided, though it was rather odd and feeble. “Nonsense,” said Mother, laying in bed with eyes as bright as beads. “I can't afford all that rubbish. Tell Mrs. Viney to boil two pounds of scrag-end of the neck for your dinners to-morrow, and I can have some of the broth. Yes, I should like some more water now, love. And will you get a basin and sponge my hands?” Roberta obeyed. When she had done everything she could to make Mother less uncomfortable, she went down to the others. Her cheeks were very red, her lips set tight, and her eyes almost as bright as Mother's. She told them what the Doctor had said, and what Mother had said. “And now,” said she, when she had told all, “there's no one but us to do anything, and we've got to do it. I've got the shilling for the mutton.” “We can do without the beastly mutton,” said Peter; “bread and butter will support life. People have lived on less on desert islands many a time.” “Of course,” said his sister. And Mrs. Viney was sent to the village to get as much brandy and soda-water and beef tea as she could buy for a shilling. “But even if we never have anything to eat at all,” said Phyllis, “you can't get all those other things with our dinner money.” “No,” said Bobbie, frowning, “we must find out some other way. Now THINK, everybody, just as hard as ever you can.” They did think. And presently they talked. And later, when Bobbie had gone up to sit with Mother in case she wanted anything, the other two were very busy with scissors and a white sheet, and a paint brush, and the pot of Brunswick black that Mrs. Viney used for grates and fenders. They did not manage to do what they wished, exactly, with the first sheet, so they took another out of the linen cupboard. It did not occur to them that they were spoiling good sheets which cost good money. They only knew that they were making a good, but what they were making comes later. Bobbie's bed had been moved into Mother's room, and several times in the night she got up to mend the fire, and to give her mother milk and soda-water. Mother talked to herself a good deal, but it did not seem to mean anything. And once she woke up suddenly and called out: “Mamma, mamma!” and Bobbie knew she was calling for Granny, and that she had forgotten that it was no use calling, because Granny was dead. In the early morning Bobbie heard her name and jumped out of bed and ran to Mother's bedside. “Oh, ah, yes, I think I was asleep,” said Mother. “My poor little duck, how tired you'll be, I do hate to give you all this trouble.” “Trouble!” said Bobbie. “Ah, don't cry, sweet,” Mother said; “I shall be all right in a day or two.” And Bobbie said, “Yes,” and tried to smile. When you are used to ten hours of solid sleep, to get up three or four times in your sleep-time makes you feel as though you had been up all night. Bobbie felt quite stupid and her eyes were sore and stiff, but she tidied the room, and arranged everything neatly before the Doctor came. This was at half-past eight. “Everything going on all right, little Nurse?” he said at the front door. “Did you get the brandy?” “I've got the brandy,” said Bobbie, “in a little flat bottle.” “I didn't see the grapes or the beef tea, though,” said he. “No,” said Bobbie, firmly, “but you will to-morrow. And there's some beef stewing in the oven for beef tea.” “Who told you to do that?” he asked. “I noticed what Mother did when Phil had mumps.” “Right,” said the Doctor. “Now you get your old woman to sit with your mother, and then you eat a good breakfast, and go straight to bed and sleep till dinner-time. We can't afford to have the head-nurse ill.” He was really quite a nice doctor. When the 9.15 came out of the tunnel that morning the old gentleman in the first-class carriage put down his newspaper, and got ready to wave his hand to the three children on the fence. But this morning there were not three. There was only one. And that was Peter. Peter was not on the railings either, as usual. He was standing in front of them in an attitude like that of a show-man showing off the animals in a menagerie, or of the kind clergyman when he points with a wand at the 'Scenes from Palestine,' when there is a magic-lantern and he is explaining it. Peter was pointing, too. And what he was pointing at was a large white sheet nailed against the fence. On the sheet there were thick black letters more than a foot long. Some of them had run a little, because of Phyllis having put the Brunswick black on too eagerly, but the words were quite easy to read. And this what the old gentleman and several other people in the train read in the large black letters on the white sheet:,       LOOK OUT AT THE STATION. A good many people did look out at the station and were disappointed, for they saw nothing unusual. The old gentleman looked out, too, and at first he too saw nothing more unusual than the gravelled platform and the sunshine and the wallflowers and forget-me-nots in the station borders. It was only just as the train was beginning to puff and pull itself together to start again that he saw Phyllis. She was quite out of breath with running. “Oh,” she said, “I thought I'd missed you. My bootlaces would keep coming down and I fell over them twice. Here, take it.” She thrust a warm, dampish letter into his hand as the train moved. He leaned back in his corner and opened the letter. This is what he read:,  “Dear Mr. We do not know your name. Mother is ill and the doctor says to give her the things at the end of the letter, but she says she can't aford it, and to get mutton for us and she will have the broth. We do not know anybody here but you, because Father is away and we do not know the address. Father will pay you, or if he has lost all his money, or anything, Peter will pay you when he is a man. We promise it on our honer. I.O.U. for all the things Mother wants.      “sined Peter. “Will you give the parsel to the Station Master, because of us not knowing what train you come down by? Say it is for Peter that was sorry about the coals and he will know all right.      “Roberta.      “Phyllis.      “Peter.” Then came the list of things the Doctor had ordered. The old gentleman read it through once, and his eyebrows went up. He read it twice and smiled a little. When he had read it thrice, he put it in his pocket and went on reading The Times. At about six that evening there was a knock at the back door. The three children rushed to open it, and there stood the friendly Porter, who had told them so many interesting things about railways. He dumped down a big hamper on the kitchen flags. “Old gent,” he said; “he asked me to fetch it up straight away.” “Thank you very much,” said Peter, and then, as the Porter lingered, he added:,  “I'm most awfully sorry I haven't got twopence to give you like Father does, but, ” “You drop it if you please,” said the Porter, indignantly. “I wasn't thinking about no tuppences. I only wanted to say I was sorry your Mamma wasn't so well, and to ask how she finds herself this evening, and I've fetched her along a bit of sweetbrier, very sweet to smell it is. Twopence indeed,” said he, and produced a bunch of sweetbrier from his hat, “just like a conjurer,” as Phyllis remarked afterwards. “Thank you very much,” said Peter, “and I beg your pardon about the twopence.” “No offence,” said the Porter, untruly but politely, and went. Then the children undid the hamper. First there was straw, and then there were fine shavings, and then came all the things they had asked for, and plenty of them, and then a good many things they had not asked for; among others peaches and port wine and two chickens, a cardboard box of big red roses with long stalks, and a tall thin green bottle of lavender water, and three smaller fatter bottles of eau-de-Cologne. There was a letter, too. “Dear Roberta and Phyllis and Peter,” it said; “here are the things you want. Your mother will want to know where they came from. Tell her they were sent by a friend who heard she was ill. When she is well again you must tell her all about it, of course. And if she says you ought not to have asked for the things, tell her that I say you were quite right, and that I hope she will forgive me for taking the liberty of allowing myself a very great pleasure.” The letter was signed G. P. something that the children couldn't read. “I think we WERE right,” said Phyllis. “Right? Of course we were right,” said Bobbie. “All the same,” said Peter, with his hands in his pockets, “I don't exactly look forward to telling Mother the whole truth about it.” “We're not to do it till she's well,” said Bobbie, “and when she's well we shall be so happy we shan't mind a little fuss like that. Oh, just look at the roses! I must take them up to her.” “And the sweetbrier,” said Phyllis, sniffing it loudly; “don't forget the sweetbrier.” “As if I should!” said Roberta. “Mother told me the other day there was a thick hedge of it at her mother's house when she was a little girl.” Chapter IV. The engine-burglar. What was left of the second sheet and the Brunswick black came in very nicely to make a banner bearing the legend      SHE IS NEARLY WELL THANK YOU and this was displayed to the Green Dragon about a fortnight after the arrival of the wonderful hamper. The old gentleman saw it, and waved a cheerful response from the train. And when this had been done the children saw that now was the time when they must tell Mother what they had done when she was ill. And it did not seem nearly so easy as they had thought it would be. But it had to be done. And it was done. Mother was extremely angry. She was seldom angry, and now she was angrier than they had ever known her. This was horrible. But it was much worse when she suddenly began to cry. Crying is catching, I believe, like measles and whooping-cough. At any rate, everyone at once found itself taking part in a crying-party. Mother stopped first. She dried her eyes and then she said:,  “I'm sorry I was so angry, darlings, because I know you didn't understand.” “We didn't mean to be naughty, Mammy,” sobbed Bobbie, and Peter and Phyllis sniffed. “Now, listen,” said Mother; “it's quite true that we're poor, but we have enough to live on. You mustn't go telling everyone about our affairs, it's not right. And you must never, never, never ask strangers to give you things. Now always remember that, won't you?” They all hugged her and rubbed their damp cheeks against hers and promised that they would. “And I'll write a letter to your old gentleman, and I shall tell him that I didn't approve, oh, of course I shall thank him, too, for his kindness. It's YOU I don't approve of, my darlings, not the old gentleman. He was as kind as ever he could be. And you can give the letter to the Station Master to give him, and we won't say any more about it.” Afterwards, when the children were alone, Bobbie said:,  “Isn't Mother splendid? You catch any other grown-up saying they were sorry they had been angry.” “Yes,” said Peter, “she IS splendid; but it's rather awful when she's angry.” “She's like Avenging and Bright in the song,” said Phyllis. “I should like to look at her if it wasn't so awful. She looks so beautiful when she's really downright furious.” They took the letter down to the Station Master. “I thought you said you hadn't got any friends except in London,” said he. “We've made him since,” said Peter. “But he doesn't live hereabouts?” “No, we just know him on the railway.” Then the Station Master retired to that sacred inner temple behind the little window where the tickets are sold, and the children went down to the Porters' room and talked to the Porter. They learned several interesting things from him, among others that his name was Perks, that he was married and had three children, that the lamps in front of engines are called head-lights and the ones at the back tail-lights. “And that just shows,” whispered Phyllis, “that trains really ARE dragons in disguise, with proper heads and tails.” It was on this day that the children first noticed that all engines are not alike. “Alike?” said the Porter, whose name was Perks, “lor, love you, no, Miss. No more alike nor what you an' me are. That little 'un without a tender as went by just now all on her own, that was a tank, that was, she's off to do some shunting t'other side o' Maidbridge. That's as it might be you, Miss. Then there's goods engines, great, strong things with three wheels each side, joined with rods to strengthen 'em, as it might be me. Then there's main-line engines as it might be this 'ere young gentleman when he grows up and wins all the races at 'is school, so he will. The main-line engine she's built for speed as well as power. That's one to the 9.15 up.” “The Green Dragon,” said Phyllis. “We calls her the Snail, Miss, among ourselves,” said the Porter. “She's oftener be'ind'and nor any train on the line.” “But the engine's green,” said Phyllis. “Yes, Miss,” said Perks, “so's a snail some seasons o' the year.” The children agreed as they went home to dinner that the Porter was most delightful company. Next day was Roberta's birthday. In the afternoon she was politely but firmly requested to get out of the way and keep there till tea-time. “You aren't to see what we're going to do till it's done; it's a glorious surprise,” said Phyllis. And Roberta went out into the garden all alone. She tried to be grateful, but she felt she would much rather have helped in whatever it was than have to spend her birthday afternoon by herself, no matter how glorious the surprise might be. Now that she was alone, she had time to think, and one of the things she thought of most was what mother had said in one of those feverish nights when her hands were so hot and her eyes so bright. The words were: “Oh, what a doctor's bill there'll be for this!” She walked round and round the garden among the rose-bushes that hadn't any roses yet, only buds, and the lilac bushes and syringas and American currants, and the more she thought of the doctor's bill, the less she liked the thought of it. And presently she made up her mind. She went out through the side door of the garden and climbed up the steep field to where the road runs along by the canal. She walked along until she came to the bridge that crosses the canal and leads to the village, and here she waited. It was very pleasant in the sunshine to lean one's elbows on the warm stone of the bridge and look down at the blue water of the canal. Bobbie had never seen any other canal, except the Regent's Canal, and the water of that is not at all a pretty colour. And she had never seen any river at all except the Thames, which also would be all the better if its face was washed. Perhaps the children would have loved the canal as much as the railway, but for two things. One was that they had found the railway FIRST, on that first, wonderful morning when the house and the country and the moors and rocks and great hills were all new to them. They had not found the canal till some days later. The other reason was that everyone on the railway had been kind to them, the Station Master, the Porter, and the old gentleman who waved. And the people on the canal were anything but kind. The people on the canal were, of course, the bargees, who steered the slow barges up and down, or walked beside the old horses that trampled up the mud of the towing-path, and strained at the long tow-ropes. Peter had once asked one of the bargees the time, and had been told to “get out of that,” in a tone so fierce that he did not stop to say anything about his having just as much right on the towing-path as the man himself. Indeed, he did not even think of saying it till some time later. Then another day when the children thought they would like to fish in the canal, a boy in a barge threw lumps of coal at them, and one of these hit Phyllis on the back of the neck. She was just stooping down to tie up her bootlace, and though the coal hardly hurt at all it made her not care very much about going on fishing. On the bridge, however, Roberta felt quite safe, because she could look down on the canal, and if any boy showed signs of meaning to throw coal, she could duck behind the parapet. Presently there was a sound of wheels, which was just what she expected. The wheels were the wheels of the Doctor's dogcart, and in the cart, of course, was the Doctor. He pulled up, and called out:,  “Hullo, head nurse! Want a lift?” “I wanted to see you,” said Bobbie. “Your mother's not worse, I hope?” said the Doctor. “No, but, ” “Well, skip in, then, and we'll go for a drive.” Roberta climbed in and the brown horse was made to turn round, which it did not like at all, for it was looking forward to its tea, I mean its oats. “This IS jolly,” said Bobbie, as the dogcart flew along the road by the canal. “We could throw a stone down any one of your three chimneys,” said the Doctor, as they passed the house. “Yes,” said Bobbie, “but you'd have to be a jolly good shot.” “How do you know I'm not?” said the Doctor. “Now, then, what's the trouble?” Bobbie fidgeted with the hook of the driving apron. “Come, out with it,” said the Doctor. “It's rather hard, you see,” said Bobbie, “to out with it; because of what Mother said.” “What DID Mother say?” “She said I wasn't to go telling everyone that we're poor. But you aren't everyone, are you?” “Not at all,” said the Doctor, cheerfully. “Well?” “Well, I know doctors are very extravagant, I mean expensive, and Mrs. Viney told me that her doctoring only cost her twopence a week because she belonged to a Club.” “Yes?” “You see she told me what a good doctor you were, and I asked her how she could afford you, because she's much poorer than we are. I've been in her house and I know. And then she told me about the Club, and I thought I'd ask you, and, oh, I don't want Mother to be worried! Can't we be in the Club, too, the same as Mrs. Viney?” The Doctor was silent. He was rather poor himself, and he had been pleased at getting a new family to attend. So I think his feelings at that minute were rather mixed. “You aren't cross with me, are you?” said Bobbie, in a very small voice. The Doctor roused himself. “Cross? How could I be? You're a very sensible little woman. Now look here, don't you worry. I'll make it all right with your Mother, even if I have to make a special brand-new Club all for her. Look here, this is where the Aqueduct begins.” “What's an Aque, what's its name?” asked Bobbie. “A water bridge,” said the Doctor. “Look.” The road rose to a bridge over the canal. To the left was a steep rocky cliff with trees and shrubs growing in the cracks of the rock. And the canal here left off running along the top of the hill and started to run on a bridge of its own, a great bridge with tall arches that went right across the valley. Bobbie drew a long breath. “It IS grand, isn't it?” she said. “It's like pictures in the History of Rome.” “Right!” said the Doctor, “that's just exactly what it IS like. The Romans were dead nuts on aqueducts. It's a splendid piece of engineering.” “I thought engineering was making engines.” “Ah, there are different sorts of engineering, making road and bridges and tunnels is one kind. And making fortifications is another. Well, we must be turning back. And, remember, you aren't to worry about doctor's bills or you'll be ill yourself, and then I'll send you in a bill as long as the aqueduct.” When Bobbie had parted from the Doctor at the top of the field that ran down from the road to Three Chimneys, she could not feel that she had done wrong. She knew that Mother would perhaps think differently. But Bobbie felt that for once she was the one who was right, and she scrambled down the rocky slope with a really happy feeling. Phyllis and Peter met her at the back door. They were unnaturally clean and neat, and Phyllis had a red bow in her hair. There was only just time for Bobbie to make herself tidy and tie up her hair with a blue bow before a little bell rang. “There!” said Phyllis, “that's to show the surprise is ready. Now you wait till the bell rings again and then you may come into the dining-room.” So Bobbie waited. “Tinkle, tinkle,” said the little bell, and Bobbie went into the dining-room, feeling rather shy. Directly she opened the door she found herself, as it seemed, in a new world of light and flowers and singing. Mother and Peter and Phyllis were standing in a row at the end of the table. The shutters were shut and there were twelve candles on the table, one for each of Roberta's years. The table was covered with a sort of pattern of flowers, and at Roberta's place was a thick wreath of forget-me-nots and several most interesting little packages. And Mother and Phyllis and Peter were singing, to the first part of the tune of St. Patrick's Day. Roberta knew that Mother had written the words on purpose for her birthday. It was a little way of Mother's on birthdays. It had begun on Bobbie's fourth birthday when Phyllis was a baby. Bobbie remembered learning the verses to say to Father 'for a surprise.' She wondered if Mother had remembered, too. The four-year-old verse had been:,       Daddy dear, I'm only four      And I'd rather not be more.      Four's the nicest age to be,      Two and two and one and three.      What I love is two and two,      Mother, Peter, Phil, and you.      What you love is one and three,      Mother, Peter, Phil, and me.      Give your little girl a kiss      Because she learned and told you this. The song the others were singing now went like this:,       Our darling Roberta,      No sorrow shall hurt her      If we can prevent it         Her whole life long.      Her birthday's our fete day,      We'll make it our great day,      And give her our presents         And sing her our song.      May pleasures attend her      And may the Fates send her      The happiest journey         Along her life's way.      With skies bright above her      And dear ones to love her!      Dear Bob!  Many happy         Returns of the day! When they had finished singing they cried, “Three cheers for our Bobbie!” and gave them very loudly. Bobbie felt exactly as though she were going to cry, you know that odd feeling in the bridge of your nose and the pricking in your eyelids? But before she had time to begin they were all kissing and hugging her. “Now,” said Mother, “look at your presents.” They were very nice presents. There was a green and red needle-book that Phyllis had made herself in secret moments. There was a darling little silver brooch of Mother's shaped like a buttercup, which Bobbie had known and loved for years, but which she had never, never thought would come to be her very own. There was also a pair of blue glass vases from Mrs. Viney. Roberta had seen and admired them in the village shop. And there were three birthday cards with pretty pictures and wishes. Mother fitted the forget-me-not crown on Bobbie's brown head. “And now look at the table,” she said. There was a cake on the table covered with white sugar, with 'Dear Bobbie' on it in pink sweets, and there were buns and jam; but the nicest thing was that the big table was almost covered with flowers, wallflowers were laid all round the tea-tray, there was a ring of forget-me-nots round each plate. The cake had a wreath of white lilac round it, and in the middle was something that looked like a pattern all done with single blooms of lilac or wallflower or laburnum. “It's a map, a map of the railway!” cried Peter. “Look, those lilac lines are the metals, and there's the station done in brown wallflowers. The laburnum is the train, and there are the signal-boxes, and the road up to here, and those fat red daisies are us three waving to the old gentleman, that's him, the pansy in the laburnum train.” “And there's 'Three Chimneys' done in the purple primroses,” said Phyllis. “And that little tiny rose-bud is Mother looking out for us when we're late for tea. Peter invented it all, and we got all the flowers from the station. We thought you'd like it better.” “That's my present,” said Peter, suddenly dumping down his adored steam-engine on the table in front of her. Its tender had been lined with fresh white paper, and was full of sweets. “Oh, Peter!” cried Bobbie, quite overcome by this munificence, “not your own dear little engine that you're so fond of?” “Oh, no,” said Peter, very promptly, “not the engine. Only the sweets.” Bobbie couldn't help her face changing a little, not so much because she was disappointed at not getting the engine, as because she had thought it so very noble of Peter, and now she felt she had been silly to think it. Also she felt she must have seemed greedy to expect the engine as well as the sweets. So her face changed. Peter saw it. He hesitated a minute; then his face changed, too, and he said: “I mean not ALL the engine. I'll let you go halves if you like.” “You're a brick,” cried Bobbie; “it's a splendid present.” She said no more aloud, but to herself she said:,  “That was awfully jolly decent of Peter because I know he didn't mean to. Well, the broken half shall be my half of the engine, and I'll get it mended and give it back to Peter for his birthday.”, “Yes, Mother dear, I should like to cut the cake,” she added, and tea began. It was a delightful birthday. After tea Mother played games with them, any game they liked, and of course their first choice was blindman's-buff, in the course of which Bobbie's forget-me-not wreath twisted itself crookedly over one of her ears and stayed there. Then, when it was near bed-time and time to calm down, Mother had a lovely new story to read to them. “You won't sit up late working, will you, Mother?” Bobbie asked as they said good night. And Mother said no, she wouldn't, she would only just write to Father and then go to bed. But when Bobbie crept down later to bring up her presents, for she felt she really could not be separated from them all night, Mother was not writing, but leaning her head on her arms and her arms on the table. I think it was rather good of Bobbie to slip quietly away, saying over and over, “She doesn't want me to know she's unhappy, and I won't know; I won't know.” But it made a sad end to the birthday.                                                                    The very next morning Bobbie began to watch her opportunity to get Peter's engine mended secretly. And the opportunity came the very next afternoon. Mother went by train to the nearest town to do shopping. When she went there, she always went to the Post-office. Perhaps to post her letters to Father, for she never gave them to the children or Mrs. Viney to post, and she never went to the village herself. Peter and Phyllis went with her. Bobbie wanted an excuse not to go, but try as she would she couldn't think of a good one. And just when she felt that all was lost, her frock caught on a big nail by the kitchen door and there was a great criss-cross tear all along the front of the skirt. I assure you this was really an accident. So the others pitied her and went without her, for there was no time for her to change, because they were rather late already and had to hurry to the station to catch the train. When they had gone, Bobbie put on her everyday frock, and went down to the railway. She did not go into the station, but she went along the line to the end of the platform where the engine is when the down train is alongside the platform, the place where there are a water tank and a long, limp, leather hose, like an elephant's trunk. She hid behind a bush on the other side of the railway. She had the toy engine done up in brown paper, and she waited patiently with it under her arm. Then when the next train came in and stopped, Bobbie went across the metals of the up-line and stood beside the engine. She had never been so close to an engine before. It looked much larger and harder than she had expected, and it made her feel very small indeed, and, somehow, very soft, as if she could very, very easily be hurt rather badly. “I know what silk-worms feel like now,” said Bobbie to herself. The engine-driver and fireman did not see her. They were leaning out on the other side, telling the Porter a tale about a dog and a leg of mutton. “If you please,” said Roberta, but the engine was blowing off steam and no one heard her. “If you please, Mr. Engineer,” she spoke a little louder, but the Engine happened to speak at the same moment, and of course Roberta's soft little voice hadn't a chance. It seemed to her that the only way would be to climb on to the engine and pull at their coats. The step was high, but she got her knee on it, and clambered into the cab; she stumbled and fell on hands and knees on the base of the great heap of coals that led up to the square opening in the tender. The engine was not above the weaknesses of its fellows; it was making a great deal more noise than there was the slightest need for. And just as Roberta fell on the coals, the engine-driver, who had turned without seeing her, started the engine, and when Bobbie had picked herself up, the train was moving, not fast, but much too fast for her to get off. All sorts of dreadful thoughts came to her all together in one horrible flash. There were such things as express trains that went on, she supposed, for hundreds of miles without stopping. Suppose this should be one of them? How would she get home again? She had no money to pay for the return journey. “And I've no business here. I'm an engine-burglar, that's what I am,”  she thought. “I shouldn't wonder if they could lock me up for this.” And the train was going faster and faster. There was something in her throat that made it impossible for her to speak. She tried twice. The men had their backs to her. They were doing something to things that looked like taps. Suddenly she put out her hand and caught hold of the nearest sleeve. The man turned with a start, and he and Roberta stood for a minute looking at each other in silence. Then the silence was broken by them both. The man said, “Here's a bloomin' go!” and Roberta burst into tears. The other man said he was blooming well blest, or something like it, but though naturally surprised they were not exactly unkind. “You're a naughty little gell, that's what you are,” said the fireman, and the engine-driver said:,  “Daring little piece, I call her,” but they made her sit down on an iron seat in the cab and told her to stop crying and tell them what she meant by it. She did stop, as soon as she could. One thing that helped her was the thought that Peter would give almost his ears to be in her place, on a real engine, really going. The children had often wondered whether any engine-driver could be found noble enough to take them for a ride on an engine, and now there she was. She dried her eyes and sniffed earnestly. “Now, then,” said the fireman, “out with it. What do you mean by it, eh?” “Oh, please,” sniffed Bobbie. “Try again,” said the engine-driver, encouragingly. Bobbie tried again. “Please, Mr. Engineer,” she said, “I did call out to you from the line, but you didn't hear me, and I just climbed up to touch you on the arm, quite gently I meant to do it, and then I fell into the coals, and I am so sorry if I frightened you. Oh, don't be cross, oh, please don't!” She sniffed again. “We ain't so much CROSS,” said the fireman, “as interested like. It ain't every day a little gell tumbles into our coal bunker outer the sky, is it, Bill? What did you DO it for, eh?” “That's the point,” agreed the engine-driver; “what did you do it FOR?” Bobbie found that she had not quite stopped crying. The engine-driver patted her on the back and said: “Here, cheer up, Mate. It ain't so bad as all that 'ere, I'll be bound.” “I wanted,” said Bobbie, much cheered to find herself addressed as 'Mate', “I only wanted to ask you if you'd be so kind as to mend this.”  She picked up the brown-paper parcel from among the coals and undid the string with hot, red fingers that trembled. Her feet and legs felt the scorch of the engine fire, but her shoulders felt the wild chill rush of the air. The engine lurched and shook and rattled, and as they shot under a bridge the engine seemed to shout in her ears. The fireman shovelled on coals. Bobbie unrolled the brown paper and disclosed the toy engine. “I thought,” she said wistfully, “that perhaps you'd mend this for me, because you're an engineer, you know.” The engine-driver said he was blowed if he wasn't blest. “I'm blest if I ain't blowed,” remarked the fireman. But the engine-driver took the little engine and looked at it, and the fireman ceased for an instant to shovel coal, and looked, too. “It's like your precious cheek,” said the engine-driver, “whatever made you think we'd be bothered tinkering penny toys?” “I didn't mean it for precious cheek,” said Bobbie; “only everybody that has anything to do with railways is so kind and good, I didn't think you'd mind. You don't really, do you?” she added, for she had seen a not unkindly wink pass between the two. “My trade's driving of an engine, not mending her, especially such a hout-size in engines as this 'ere,” said Bill. “An' 'ow are we a-goin' to get you back to your sorrowing friends and relations, and all be forgiven and forgotten?” “If you'll put me down next time you stop,” said Bobbie, firmly, though her heart beat fiercely against her arm as she clasped her hands, “and lend me the money for a third-class ticket, I'll pay you back, honour bright. I'm not a confidence trick like in the newspapers, really, I'm not.” “You're a little lady, every inch,” said Bill, relenting suddenly and completely. “We'll see you gets home safe. An' about this engine, Jim, ain't you got ne'er a pal as can use a soldering iron? Seems to me that's about all the little bounder wants doing to it.” “That's what Father said,” Bobbie explained eagerly. “What's that for?” She pointed to a little brass wheel that he had turned as he spoke. “That's the injector.” “In, what?” “Injector to fill up the boiler.” “Oh,” said Bobbie, mentally registering the fact to tell the others; “that IS interesting.” “This 'ere's the automatic brake,” Bill went on, flattered by her enthusiasm. “You just move this 'ere little handle, do it with one finger, you can, and the train jolly soon stops. That's what they call the Power of Science in the newspapers.” He showed her two little dials, like clock faces, and told her how one showed how much steam was going, and the other showed if the brake was working properly. By the time she had seen him shut off steam with a big shining steel handle, Bobbie knew more about the inside working of an engine than she had ever thought there was to know, and Jim had promised that his second cousin's wife's brother should solder the toy engine, or Jim would know the reason why. Besides all the knowledge she had gained Bobbie felt that she and Bill and Jim were now friends for life, and that they had wholly and forever forgiven her for stumbling uninvited among the sacred coals of their tender. At Stacklepoole Junction she parted from them with warm expressions of mutual regard. They handed her over to the guard of a returning train, a friend of theirs, and she had the joy of knowing what guards do in their secret fastnesses, and understood how, when you pull the communication cord in railway carriages, a wheel goes round under the guard's nose and a loud bell rings in his ears. She asked the guard why his van smelt so fishy, and learned that he had to carry a lot of fish every day, and that the wetness in the hollows of the corrugated floor had all drained out of boxes full of plaice and cod and mackerel and soles and smelts. Bobbie got home in time for tea, and she felt as though her mind would burst with all that had been put into it since she parted from the others. How she blessed the nail that had torn her frock! “Where have you been?” asked the others. “To the station, of course,” said Roberta. But she would not tell a word of her adventures till the day appointed, when she mysteriously led them to the station at the hour of the 3.19's transit, and proudly introduced them to her friends, Bill and Jim. Jim's second cousin's wife's brother had not been unworthy of the sacred trust reposed in him. The toy engine was, literally, as good as new. “Good-bye, oh, good-bye,” said Bobbie, just before the engine screamed ITS good-bye. “I shall always, always love you, and Jim's second cousin's wife's brother as well!” And as the three children went home up the hill, Peter hugging the engine, now quite its own self again, Bobbie told, with joyous leaps of the heart, the story of how she had been an Engine-burglar. Chapter V. Prisoners and captives. It was one day when Mother had gone to Maidbridge. She had gone alone, but the children were to go to the station to meet her. And, loving the station as they did, it was only natural that they should be there a good hour before there was any chance of Mother's train arriving, even if the train were punctual, which was most unlikely. No doubt they would have been just as early, even if it had been a fine day, and all the delights of woods and fields and rocks and rivers had been open to them. But it happened to be a very wet day and, for July, very cold. There was a wild wind that drove flocks of dark purple clouds across the sky “like herds of dream-elephants,” as Phyllis said. And the rain stung sharply, so that the way to the station was finished at a run. Then the rain fell faster and harder, and beat slantwise against the windows of the booking office and of the chill place that had General Waiting Room on its door. “It's like being in a besieged castle,” Phyllis said; “look at the arrows of the foe striking against the battlements!” “It's much more like a great garden-squirt,” said Peter. They decided to wait on the up side, for the down platform looked very wet indeed, and the rain was driving right into the little bleak shelter where down-passengers have to wait for their trains. The hour would be full of incident and of interest, for there would be two up trains and one down to look at before the one that should bring Mother back. “Perhaps it'll have stopped raining by then,” said Bobbie; “anyhow, I'm glad I brought Mother's waterproof and umbrella.” They went into the desert spot labelled General Waiting Room, and the time passed pleasantly enough in a game of advertisements. You know the game, of course? It is something like dumb Crambo. The players take it in turns to go out, and then come back and look as like some advertisement as they can, and the others have to guess what advertisement it is meant to be. Bobbie came in and sat down under Mother's umbrella and made a sharp face, and everyone knew she was the fox who sits under the umbrella in the advertisement. Phyllis tried to make a Magic Carpet of Mother's waterproof, but it would not stand out stiff and raft-like as a Magic Carpet should, and nobody could guess it. Everyone thought Peter was carrying things a little too far when he blacked his face all over with coal-dust and struck a spidery attitude and said he was the blot that advertises somebody's Blue Black Writing Fluid. It was Phyllis's turn again, and she was trying to look like the Sphinx that advertises What's-his-name's Personally Conducted Tours up the Nile when the sharp ting of the signal announced the up train. The children rushed out to see it pass. On its engine were the particular driver and fireman who were now numbered among the children's dearest friends. Courtesies passed between them. Jim asked after the toy engine, and Bobbie pressed on his acceptance a moist, greasy package of toffee that she had made herself. Charmed by this attention, the engine-driver consented to consider her request that some day he would take Peter for a ride on the engine. “Stand back, Mates,” cried the engine-driver, suddenly, “and horf she goes.” And sure enough, off the train went. The children watched the tail-lights of the train till it disappeared round the curve of the line, and then turned to go back to the dusty freedom of the General Waiting Room and the joys of the advertisement game. They expected to see just one or two people, the end of the procession of passengers who had given up their tickets and gone away. Instead, the platform round the door of the station had a dark blot round it, and the dark blot was a crowd of people. “Oh!” cried Peter, with a thrill of joyous excitement, “something's happened! Come on!” They ran down the platform. When they got to the crowd, they could, of course, see nothing but the damp backs and elbows of the people on the crowd's outside. Everybody was talking at once. It was evident that something had happened. “It's my belief he's nothing worse than a natural,” said a farmerish-looking person. Peter saw his red, clean-shaven face as he spoke. “If you ask me, I should say it was a Police Court case,” said a young man with a black bag. “Not it; the Infirmary more like, ” Then the voice of the Station Master was heard, firm and official:,  “Now, then, move along there. I'll attend to this, if YOU please.” But the crowd did not move. And then came a voice that thrilled the children through and through. For it spoke in a foreign language. And, what is more, it was a language that they had never heard. They had heard French spoken and German. Aunt Emma knew German, and used to sing a song about bedeuten and zeiten and bin and sin. Nor was it Latin. Peter had been in Latin for four terms. It was some comfort, anyhow, to find that none of the crowd understood the foreign language any better than the children did. “What's that he's saying?” asked the farmer, heavily. “Sounds like French to me,” said the Station Master, who had once been to Boulogne for the day. “It isn't French!” cried Peter. “What is it, then?” asked more than one voice. The crowd fell back a little to see who had spoken, and Peter pressed forward, so that when the crowd closed up again he was in the front rank. “I don't know what it is,” said Peter, “but it isn't French. I know that.” Then he saw what it was that the crowd had for its centre. It was a man, the man, Peter did not doubt, who had spoken in that strange tongue. A man with long hair and wild eyes, with shabby clothes of a cut Peter had not seen before, a man whose hands and lips trembled, and who spoke again as his eyes fell on Peter. “No, it's not French,” said Peter. “Try him with French if you know so much about it,” said the farmer-man. “Parlay voo Frongsay?” began Peter, boldly, and the next moment the crowd recoiled again, for the man with the wild eyes had left leaning against the wall, and had sprung forward and caught Peter's hands, and begun to pour forth a flood of words which, though he could not understand a word of them, Peter knew the sound of. “There!” said he, and turned, his hands still clasped in the hands of the strange shabby figure, to throw a glance of triumph at the crowd; “there; THAT'S French.” “What does he say?” “I don't know.” Peter was obliged to own it. “Here,” said the Station Master again; “you move on if you please. I'LL deal with this case.” A few of the more timid or less inquisitive travellers moved slowly and reluctantly away. And Phyllis and Bobbie got near to Peter. All three had been TAUGHT French at school. How deeply they now wished that they had LEARNED it! Peter shook his head at the stranger, but he also shook his hands as warmly and looked at him as kindly as he could. A person in the crowd, after some hesitation, said suddenly, “No comprenny!” and then, blushing deeply, backed out of the press and went away. “Take him into your room,” whispered Bobbie to the Station Master. “Mother can talk French. She'll be here by the next train from Maidbridge.” The Station Master took the arm of the stranger, suddenly but not unkindly. But the man wrenched his arm away, and cowered back coughing and trembling and trying to push the Station Master away. “Oh, don't!” said Bobbie; “don't you see how frightened he is? He thinks you're going to shut him up. I know he does, look at his eyes!” “They're like a fox's eyes when the beast's in a trap,” said the farmer. “Oh, let me try!” Bobbie went on; “I do really know one or two French words if I could only think of them.” Sometimes, in moments of great need, we can do wonderful things, things that in ordinary life we could hardly even dream of doing. Bobbie had never been anywhere near the top of her French class, but she must have learned something without knowing it, for now, looking at those wild, hunted eyes, she actually remembered and, what is more, spoke, some French words. She said:,  “Vous attendre. Ma mere parlez Francais. Nous, what's the French for 'being kind'?” Nobody knew. “Bong is 'good,'” said Phyllis. “Nous etre bong pour vous.” I do not know whether the man understood her words, but he understood the touch of the hand she thrust into his, and the kindness of the other hand that stroked his shabby sleeve. She pulled him gently towards the inmost sanctuary of the Station Master. The other children followed, and the Station Master shut the door in the face of the crowd, which stood a little while in the booking office talking and looking at the fast closed yellow door, and then by ones and twos went its way, grumbling. Inside the Station Master's room Bobbie still held the stranger's hand and stroked his sleeve. “Here's a go,” said the Station Master; “no ticket, doesn't even know where he wants to go. I'm not sure now but what I ought to send for the police.” “Oh, DON'T!” all the children pleaded at once. And suddenly Bobbie got between the others and the stranger, for she had seen that he was crying. By a most unusual piece of good fortune she had a handkerchief in her pocket. By a still more uncommon accident the handkerchief was moderately clean. Standing in front of the stranger, she got out the handkerchief and passed it to him so that the others did not see. “Wait till Mother comes,” Phyllis was saying; “she does speak French beautifully. You'd just love to hear her.” “I'm sure he hasn't done anything like you're sent to prison for,” said Peter. “Looks like without visible means to me,” said the Station Master. “Well, I don't mind giving him the benefit of the doubt till your Mamma comes. I SHOULD like to know what nation's got the credit of HIM, that I should.” Then Peter had an idea. He pulled an envelope out of his pocket, and showed that it was half full of foreign stamps. “Look here,” he said, “let's show him these, ” Bobbie looked and saw that the stranger had dried his eyes with her handkerchief. So she said: “All right.” They showed him an Italian stamp, and pointed from him to it and back again, and made signs of question with their eyebrows. He shook his head. Then they showed him a Norwegian stamp, the common blue kind it was, and again he signed No. Then they showed him a Spanish one, and at that he took the envelope from Peter's hand and searched among the stamps with a hand that trembled. The hand that he reached out at last, with a gesture as of one answering a question, contained a RUSSIAN stamp. “He's Russian,” cried Peter, “or else he's like 'the man who was', in Kipling, you know.” The train from Maidbridge was signalled. “I'll stay with him till you bring Mother in,” said Bobbie. “You're not afraid, Missie?” “Oh, no,” said Bobbie, looking at the stranger, as she might have looked at a strange dog of doubtful temper. “You wouldn't hurt me, would you?” She smiled at him, and he smiled back, a queer crooked smile. And then he coughed again. And the heavy rattling swish of the incoming train swept past, and the Station Master and Peter and Phyllis went out to meet it. Bobbie was still holding the stranger's hand when they came back with Mother. The Russian rose and bowed very ceremoniously. Then Mother spoke in French, and he replied, haltingly at first, but presently in longer and longer sentences. The children, watching his face and Mother's, knew that he was telling her things that made her angry and pitying, and sorry and indignant all at once. “Well, Mum, what's it all about?” The Station Master could not restrain his curiosity any longer. “Oh,” said Mother, “it's all right. He's a Russian, and he's lost his ticket. And I'm afraid he's very ill. If you don't mind, I'll take him home with me now. He's really quite worn out. I'll run down and tell you all about him to-morrow.” “I hope you won't find you're taking home a frozen viper,” said the Station Master, doubtfully. “Oh, no,” Mother said brightly, and she smiled; “I'm quite sure I'm not. Why, he's a great man in his own country, writes books, beautiful books, I've read some of them; but I'll tell you all about it to-morrow.” She spoke again in French to the Russian, and everyone could see the surprise and pleasure and gratitude in his eyes. He got up and politely bowed to the Station Master, and offered his arm most ceremoniously to Mother. She took it, but anybody could have seen that she was helping him along, and not he her. “You girls run home and light a fire in the sitting-room,” Mother said, “and Peter had better go for the Doctor.” But it was Bobbie who went for the Doctor. “I hate to tell you,” she said breathlessly when she came upon him in his shirt sleeves, weeding his pansy-bed, “but Mother's got a very shabby Russian, and I'm sure he'll have to belong to your Club. I'm certain he hasn't got any money. We found him at the station.” “Found him! Was he lost, then?” asked the Doctor, reaching for his coat. “Yes,” said Bobbie, unexpectedly, “that's just what he was. He's been telling Mother the sad, sweet story of his life in French; and she said would you be kind enough to come directly if you were at home. He has a dreadful cough, and he's been crying.” The Doctor smiled. “Oh, don't,” said Bobbie; “please don't. You wouldn't if you'd seen him. I never saw a man cry before. You don't know what it's like.” Dr. Forrest wished then that he hadn't smiled. When Bobbie and the Doctor got to Three Chimneys, the Russian was sitting in the arm-chair that had been Father's, stretching his feet to the blaze of a bright wood fire, and sipping the tea Mother had made him. “The man seems worn out, mind and body,” was what the Doctor said; “the cough's bad, but there's nothing that can't be cured. He ought to go straight to bed, though, and let him have a fire at night.” “I'll make one in my room; it's the only one with a fireplace,” said Mother. She did, and presently the Doctor helped the stranger to bed. There was a big black trunk in Mother's room that none of the children had ever seen unlocked. Now, when she had lighted the fire, she unlocked it and took some clothes out, men's clothes, and set them to air by the newly lighted fire. Bobbie, coming in with more wood for the fire, saw the mark on the night-shirt, and looked over to the open trunk. All the things she could see were men's clothes. And the name marked on the shirt was Father's name. Then Father hadn't taken his clothes with him. And that night-shirt was one of Father's new ones. Bobbie remembered its being made, just before Peter's birthday. Why hadn't Father taken his clothes? Bobbie slipped from the room. As she went she heard the key turned in the lock of the trunk. Her heart was beating horribly. WHY hadn't Father taken his clothes? When Mother came out of the room, Bobbie flung tightly clasping arms round her waist, and whispered:,  “Mother, Daddy isn't, isn't DEAD, is he?” “My darling, no! What made you think of anything so horrible?” “I, I don't know,” said Bobbie, angry with herself, but still clinging to that resolution of hers, not to see anything that Mother didn't mean her to see. Mother gave her a hurried hug. “Daddy was quite, QUITE well when I heard from him last,” she said, “and he'll come back to us some day. Don't fancy such horrible things, darling!” Later on, when the Russian stranger had been made comfortable for the night, Mother came into the girls' room. She was to sleep there in Phyllis's bed, and Phyllis was to have a mattress on the floor, a most amusing adventure for Phyllis. Directly Mother came in, two white figures started up, and two eager voices called:,  “Now, Mother, tell us all about the Russian gentleman.” A white shape hopped into the room. It was Peter, dragging his quilt behind him like the tail of a white peacock. “We have been patient,” he said, “and I had to bite my tongue not to go to sleep, and I just nearly went to sleep and I bit too hard, and it hurts ever so. DO tell us. Make a nice long story of it.” “I can't make a long story of it to-night,” said Mother; “I'm very tired.” Bobbie knew by her voice that Mother had been crying, but the others didn't know. “Well, make it as long as you can,” said Phil, and Bobbie got her arms round Mother's waist and snuggled close to her. “Well, it's a story long enough to make a whole book of. He's a writer; he's written beautiful books. In Russia at the time of the Czar one dared not say anything about the rich people doing wrong, or about the things that ought to be done to make poor people better and happier. If one did one was sent to prison.” “But they CAN'T,” said Peter; “people only go to prison when they've done wrong.” “Or when the Judges THINK they've done wrong,” said Mother. “Yes, that's so in England. But in Russia it was different. And he wrote a beautiful book about poor people and how to help them. I've read it. There's nothing in it but goodness and kindness. And they sent him to prison for it. He was three years in a horrible dungeon, with hardly any light, and all damp and dreadful. In prison all alone for three years.” Mother's voice trembled a little and stopped suddenly. “But, Mother,” said Peter, “that can't be true NOW. It sounds like something out of a history book, the Inquisition, or something.” “It WAS true,” said Mother; “it's all horribly true. Well, then they took him out and sent him to Siberia, a convict chained to other convicts, wicked men who'd done all sorts of crimes, a long chain of them, and they walked, and walked, and walked, for days and weeks, till he thought they'd never stop walking. And overseers went behind them with whips, yes, whips, to beat them if they got tired. And some of them went lame, and some fell down, and when they couldn't get up and go on, they beat them, and then left them to die. Oh, it's all too terrible! And at last he got to the mines, and he was condemned to stay there for life, for life, just for writing a good, noble, splendid book.” “How did he get away?” “When the war came, some of the Russian prisoners were allowed to volunteer as soldiers. And he volunteered. But he deserted at the first chance he got and, ” “But that's very cowardly, isn't it”, said Peter, “to desert? Especially when it's war.” “Do you think he owed anything to a country that had done THAT to him? If he did, he owed more to his wife and children. He didn't know what had become of them.” “Oh,” cried Bobbie, “he had THEM to think about and be miserable about TOO, then, all the time he was in prison?” “Yes, he had them to think about and be miserable about all the time he was in prison. For anything he knew they might have been sent to prison, too. They did those things in Russia. But while he was in the mines some friends managed to get a message to him that his wife and children had escaped and come to England. So when he deserted he came here to look for them.” “Had he got their address?” said practical Peter. “No; just England. He was going to London, and he thought he had to change at our station, and then he found he'd lost his ticket and his purse.” “Oh, DO you think he'll find them?, I mean his wife and children, not the ticket and things.” “I hope so. Oh, I hope and pray that he'll find his wife and children again.” Even Phyllis now perceived that mother's voice was very unsteady. “Why, Mother,” she said, “how very sorry you seem to be for him!” Mother didn't answer for a minute. Then she just said, “Yes,” and then she seemed to be thinking. The children were quiet. Presently she said, “Dears, when you say your prayers, I think you might ask God to show His pity upon all prisoners and captives.” “To show His pity,” Bobbie repeated slowly, “upon all prisoners and captives. Is that right, Mother?” “Yes,” said Mother, “upon all prisoners and captives. All prisoners and captives.” Chapter VI. Saviours of the train. The Russian gentleman was better the next day, and the day after that better still, and on the third day he was well enough to come into the garden. A basket chair was put for him and he sat there, dressed in clothes of Father's which were too big for him. But when Mother had hemmed up the ends of the sleeves and the trousers, the clothes did well enough. His was a kind face now that it was no longer tired and frightened, and he smiled at the children whenever he saw them. They wished very much that he could speak English. Mother wrote several letters to people she thought might know whereabouts in England a Russian gentleman's wife and family might possibly be; not to the people she used to know before she came to live at Three Chimneys, she never wrote to any of them, but strange people, Members of Parliament and Editors of papers, and Secretaries of Societies. And she did not do much of her story-writing, only corrected proofs as she sat in the sun near the Russian, and talked to him every now and then. The children wanted very much to show how kindly they felt to this man who had been sent to prison and to Siberia just for writing a beautiful book about poor people. They could smile at him, of course; they could and they did. But if you smile too constantly, the smile is apt to get fixed like the smile of the hyaena. And then it no longer looks friendly, but simply silly. So they tried other ways, and brought him flowers till the place where he sat was surrounded by little fading bunches of clover and roses and Canterbury bells. And then Phyllis had an idea. She beckoned mysteriously to the others and drew them into the back yard, and there, in a concealed spot, between the pump and the water-butt, she said:,  “You remember Perks promising me the very first strawberries out of his own garden?” Perks, you will recollect, was the Porter. “Well, I should think they're ripe now. Let's go down and see.” Mother had been down as she had promised to tell the Station Master the story of the Russian Prisoner. But even the charms of the railway had been unable to tear the children away from the neighbourhood of the interesting stranger. So they had not been to the station for three days. They went now. And, to their surprise and distress, were very coldly received by Perks. “'Ighly honoured, I'm sure,” he said when they peeped in at the door of the Porters' room. And he went on reading his newspaper. There was an uncomfortable silence. “Oh, dear,” said Bobbie, with a sigh, “I do believe you're CROSS.” “What, me? Not me!” said Perks loftily; “it ain't nothing to me.” “What AIN'T nothing to you?” said Peter, too anxious and alarmed to change the form of words. “Nothing ain't nothing. What 'appens either 'ere or elsewhere,” said Perks; “if you likes to 'ave your secrets, 'ave 'em and welcome. That's what I say.” The secret-chamber of each heart was rapidly examined during the pause that followed. Three heads were shaken. “We haven't got any secrets from YOU,” said Bobbie at last. “Maybe you 'ave, and maybe you 'aven't,” said Perks; “it ain't nothing to me. And I wish you all a very good afternoon.” He held up the paper between him and them and went on reading. “Oh, DON'T!” said Phyllis, in despair; “this is truly dreadful! Whatever it is, do tell us.” “We didn't mean to do it whatever it was.” No answer. The paper was refolded and Perks began on another column. “Look here,” said Peter, suddenly, “it's not fair. Even people who do crimes aren't punished without being told what it's for, as once they were in Russia.” “I don't know nothing about Russia.” “Oh, yes, you do, when Mother came down on purpose to tell you and Mr. Gills all about OUR Russian.” “Can't you fancy it?” said Perks, indignantly; “don't you see 'im a-asking of me to step into 'is room and take a chair and listen to what 'er Ladyship 'as to say?” “Do you mean to say you've not heard?” “Not so much as a breath. I did go so far as to put a question. And he shuts me up like a rat-trap. 'Affairs of State, Perks,' says he. But I did think one o' you would 'a' nipped down to tell me, you're here sharp enough when you want to get anything out of old Perks”, Phyllis flushed purple as she thought of the strawberries, “information about locomotives or signals or the likes,” said Perks. “We didn't know you didn't know.” “We thought Mother had told you.” “Wewantedtotellyouonlywethoughtitwouldbestalenews.” The three spoke all at once. Perks said it was all very well, and still held up the paper. Then Phyllis suddenly snatched it away, and threw her arms round his neck. “Oh, let's kiss and be friends,” she said; “we'll say we're sorry first, if you like, but we didn't really know that you didn't know.” “We are so sorry,” said the others. And Perks at last consented to accept their apologies. Then they got him to come out and sit in the sun on the green Railway Bank, where the grass was quite hot to touch, and there, sometimes speaking one at a time, and sometimes all together, they told the Porter the story of the Russian Prisoner. “Well, I must say,” said Perks; but he did not say it, whatever it was. “Yes, it is pretty awful, isn't it?” said Peter, “and I don't wonder you were curious about who the Russian was.” “I wasn't curious, not so much as interested,” said the Porter. “Well, I do think Mr. Gills might have told you about it. It was horrid of him.” “I don't keep no down on 'im for that, Missie,” said the Porter; “cos why? I see 'is reasons. 'E wouldn't want to give away 'is own side with a tale like that 'ere. It ain't human nature. A man's got to stand up for his own side whatever they does. That's what it means by Party Politics. I should 'a' done the same myself if that long-'aired chap 'ad 'a' been a Jap.” “But the Japs didn't do cruel, wicked things like that,” said Bobbie. “P'r'aps not,” said Perks, cautiously; “still you can't be sure with foreigners. My own belief is they're all tarred with the same brush.” “Then why were you on the side of the Japs?” Peter asked. “Well, you see, you must take one side or the other. Same as with Liberals and Conservatives. The great thing is to take your side and then stick to it, whatever happens.” A signal sounded. “There's the 3.14 up,” said Perks. “You lie low till she's through, and then we'll go up along to my place, and see if there's any of them strawberries ripe what I told you about.” “If there are any ripe, and you DO give them to me,” said Phyllis, “you won't mind if I give them to the poor Russian, will you?” Perks narrowed his eyes and then raised his eyebrows. “So it was them strawberries you come down for this afternoon, eh?” said he. This was an awkward moment for Phyllis. To say “yes” would seem rude and greedy, and unkind to Perks. But she knew if she said “no,” she would not be pleased with herself afterwards. So,  “Yes,” she said, “it was.” “Well done!” said the Porter; “speak the truth and shame the, ” “But we'd have come down the very next day if we'd known you hadn't heard the story,” Phyllis added hastily. “I believe you, Missie,” said Perks, and sprang across the line six feet in front of the advancing train. The girls hated to see him do this, but Peter liked it. It was so exciting. The Russian gentleman was so delighted with the strawberries that the three racked their brains to find some other surprise for him. But all the racking did not bring out any idea more novel than wild cherries. And this idea occurred to them next morning. They had seen the blossom on the trees in the spring, and they knew where to look for wild cherries now that cherry time was here. The trees grew all up and along the rocky face of the cliff out of which the mouth of the tunnel opened. There were all sorts of trees there, birches and beeches and baby oaks and hazels, and among them the cherry blossom had shone like snow and silver. The mouth of the tunnel was some way from Three Chimneys, so Mother let them take their lunch with them in a basket. And the basket would do to bring the cherries back in if they found any. She also lent them her silver watch so that they should not be late for tea. Peter's Waterbury had taken it into its head not to go since the day when Peter dropped it into the water-butt. And they started. When they got to the top of the cutting, they leaned over the fence and looked down to where the railway lines lay at the bottom of what, as Phyllis said, was exactly like a mountain gorge. “If it wasn't for the railway at the bottom, it would be as though the foot of man had never been there, wouldn't it?” The sides of the cutting were of grey stone, very roughly hewn. Indeed, the top part of the cutting had been a little natural glen that had been cut deeper to bring it down to the level of the tunnel's mouth. Among the rocks, grass and flowers grew, and seeds dropped by birds in the crannies of the stone had taken root and grown into bushes and trees that overhung the cutting. Near the tunnel was a flight of steps leading down to the line, just wooden bars roughly fixed into the earth, a very steep and narrow way, more like a ladder than a stair. “We'd better get down,” said Peter; “I'm sure the cherries would be quite easy to get at from the side of the steps. You remember it was there we picked the cherry blossoms that we put on the rabbit's grave.” So they went along the fence towards the little swing gate that is at the top of these steps. And they were almost at the gate when Bobbie said:,  “Hush. Stop! What's that?” “That” was a very odd noise indeed, a soft noise, but quite plainly to be heard through the sound of the wind in tree branches, and the hum and whir of the telegraph wires. It was a sort of rustling, whispering sound. As they listened it stopped, and then it began again. And this time it did not stop, but it grew louder and more rustling and rumbling. “Look”, cried Peter, suddenly, “the tree over there!” The tree he pointed at was one of those that have rough grey leaves and white flowers. The berries, when they come, are bright scarlet, but if you pick them, they disappoint you by turning black before you get them home. And, as Peter pointed, the tree was moving, not just the way trees ought to move when the wind blows through them, but all in one piece, as though it were a live creature and were walking down the side of the cutting. “It's moving!” cried Bobbie. “Oh, look! and so are the others. It's like the woods in Macbeth.” “It's magic,” said Phyllis, breathlessly. “I always knew this railway was enchanted.” It really did seem a little like magic. For all the trees for about twenty yards of the opposite bank seemed to be slowly walking down towards the railway line, the tree with the grey leaves bringing up the rear like some old shepherd driving a flock of green sheep. “What is it? Oh, what is it?” said Phyllis; “it's much too magic for me. I don't like it. Let's go home.” But Bobbie and Peter clung fast to the rail and watched breathlessly. And Phyllis made no movement towards going home by herself. The trees moved on and on. Some stones and loose earth fell down and rattled on the railway metals far below. “It's ALL coming down,” Peter tried to say, but he found there was hardly any voice to say it with. And, indeed, just as he spoke, the great rock, on the top of which the walking trees were, leaned slowly forward. The trees, ceasing to walk, stood still and shivered. Leaning with the rock, they seemed to hesitate a moment, and then rock and trees and grass and bushes, with a rushing sound, slipped right away from the face of the cutting and fell on the line with a blundering crash that could have been heard half a mile off. A cloud of dust rose up. “Oh,” said Peter, in awestruck tones, “isn't it exactly like when coals come in?, if there wasn't any roof to the cellar and you could see down.” “Look what a great mound it's made!” said Bobbie. “Yes,” said Peter, slowly. He was still leaning on the fence. “Yes,” he said again, still more slowly. Then he stood upright. “The 11.29 down hasn't gone by yet. We must let them know at the station, or there'll be a most frightful accident.” “Let's run,” said Bobbie, and began. But Peter cried, “Come back!” and looked at Mother's watch. He was very prompt and businesslike, and his face looked whiter than they had ever seen it. “No time,” he said; “it's two miles away, and it's past eleven.” “Couldn't we,” suggested Phyllis, breathlessly, “couldn't we climb up a telegraph post and do something to the wires?” “We don't know how,” said Peter. “They do it in war,” said Phyllis; “I know I've heard of it.” “They only CUT them, silly,” said Peter, “and that doesn't do any good. And we couldn't cut them even if we got up, and we couldn't get up. If we had anything red, we could get down on the line and wave it.” “But the train wouldn't see us till it got round the corner, and then it could see the mound just as well as us,” said Phyllis; “better, because it's much bigger than us.” “If we only had something red,” Peter repeated, “we could go round the corner and wave to the train.” “We might wave, anyway.” “They'd only think it was just US, as usual. We've waved so often before. Anyway, let's get down.” They got down the steep stairs. Bobbie was pale and shivering. Peter's face looked thinner than usual. Phyllis was red-faced and damp with anxiety. “Oh, how hot I am!” she said; “and I thought it was going to be cold; I wish we hadn't put on our, ” she stopped short, and then ended in quite a different tone, “our flannel petticoats.” Bobbie turned at the bottom of the stairs. “Oh, yes,” she cried; “THEY'RE red! Let's take them off.” They did, and with the petticoats rolled up under their arms, ran along the railway, skirting the newly fallen mound of stones and rock and earth, and bent, crushed, twisted trees. They ran at their best pace. Peter led, but the girls were not far behind. They reached the corner that hid the mound from the straight line of railway that ran half a mile without curve or corner. “Now,” said Peter, taking hold of the largest flannel petticoat. “You're not”, Phyllis faltered, “you're not going to TEAR them?” “Shut up,” said Peter, with brief sternness. “Oh, yes,” said Bobbie, “tear them into little bits if you like. Don't you see, Phil, if we can't stop the train, there'll be a real live accident, with people KILLED. Oh, horrible! Here, Peter, you'll never tear it through the band!” She took the red flannel petticoat from him and tore it off an inch from the band. Then she tore the other in the same way. “There!” said Peter, tearing in his turn. He divided each petticoat into three pieces. “Now, we've got six flags.” He looked at the watch again. “And we've got seven minutes. We must have flagstaffs.” The knives given to boys are, for some odd reason, seldom of the kind of steel that keeps sharp. The young saplings had to be broken off. Two came up by the roots. The leaves were stripped from them. “We must cut holes in the flags, and run the sticks through the holes,”  said Peter. And the holes were cut. The knife was sharp enough to cut flannel with. Two of the flags were set up in heaps of loose stones between the sleepers of the down line. Then Phyllis and Roberta took each a flag, and stood ready to wave it as soon as the train came in sight. “I shall have the other two myself,” said Peter, “because it was my idea to wave something red.” “They're our petticoats, though,” Phyllis was beginning, but Bobbie interrupted,  “Oh, what does it matter who waves what, if we can only save the train?” Perhaps Peter had not rightly calculated the number of minutes it would take the 11.29 to get from the station to the place where they were, or perhaps the train was late. Anyway, it seemed a very long time that they waited. Phyllis grew impatient. “I expect the watch is wrong, and the train's gone by,” said she. Peter relaxed the heroic attitude he had chosen to show off his two flags. And Bobbie began to feel sick with suspense. It seemed to her that they had been standing there for hours and hours, holding those silly little red flannel flags that no one would ever notice. The train wouldn't care. It would go rushing by them and tear round the corner and go crashing into that awful mound. And everyone would be killed. Her hands grew very cold and trembled so that she could hardly hold the flag. And then came the distant rumble and hum of the metals, and a puff of white steam showed far away along the stretch of line. “Stand firm,” said Peter, “and wave like mad! When it gets to that big furze bush step back, but go on waving! Don't stand ON the line, Bobbie!” The train came rattling along very, very fast. “They don't see us! They won't see us! It's all no good!” cried Bobbie. The two little flags on the line swayed as the nearing train shook and loosened the heaps of loose stones that held them up. One of them slowly leaned over and fell on the line. Bobbie jumped forward and caught it up, and waved it; her hands did not tremble now. It seemed that the train came on as fast as ever. It was very near now. “Keep off the line, you silly cuckoo!” said Peter, fiercely. “It's no good,” Bobbie said again. “Stand back!” cried Peter, suddenly, and he dragged Phyllis back by the arm. But Bobbie cried, “Not yet, not yet!” and waved her two flags right over the line. The front of the engine looked black and enormous. Its voice was loud and harsh. “Oh, stop, stop, stop!” cried Bobbie. No one heard her. At least Peter and Phyllis didn't, for the oncoming rush of the train covered the sound of her voice with a mountain of sound. But afterwards she used to wonder whether the engine itself had not heard her. It seemed almost as though it had, for it slackened swiftly, slackened and stopped, not twenty yards from the place where Bobbie's two flags waved over the line. She saw the great black engine stop dead, but somehow she could not stop waving the flags. And when the driver and the fireman had got off the engine and Peter and Phyllis had gone to meet them and pour out their excited tale of the awful mound just round the corner, Bobbie still waved the flags but more and more feebly and jerkily. When the others turned towards her she was lying across the line with her hands flung forward and still gripping the sticks of the little red flannel flags. The engine-driver picked her up, carried her to the train, and laid her on the cushions of a first-class carriage. “Gone right off in a faint,” he said, “poor little woman. And no wonder. I'll just 'ave a look at this 'ere mound of yours, and then we'll run you back to the station and get her seen to.” It was horrible to see Bobbie lying so white and quiet, with her lips blue, and parted. “I believe that's what people look like when they're dead,” whispered Phyllis. “DON'T!” said Peter, sharply. They sat by Bobbie on the blue cushions, and the train ran back. Before it reached their station Bobbie had sighed and opened her eyes, and rolled herself over and begun to cry. This cheered the others wonderfully. They had seen her cry before, but they had never seen her faint, nor anyone else, for the matter of that. They had not known what to do when she was fainting, but now she was only crying they could thump her on the back and tell her not to, just as they always did. And presently, when she stopped crying, they were able to laugh at her for being such a coward as to faint. When the station was reached, the three were the heroes of an agitated meeting on the platform. The praises they got for their “prompt action,” their “common sense,”  their “ingenuity,” were enough to have turned anybody's head. Phyllis enjoyed herself thoroughly. She had never been a real heroine before, and the feeling was delicious. Peter's ears got very red. Yet he, too, enjoyed himself. Only Bobbie wished they all wouldn't. She wanted to get away. “You'll hear from the Company about this, I expect,” said the Station Master. Bobbie wished she might never hear of it again. She pulled at Peter's jacket. “Oh, come away, come away! I want to go home,” she said. So they went. And as they went Station Master and Porter and guards and driver and fireman and passengers sent up a cheer. “Oh, listen,” cried Phyllis; “that's for US!” “Yes,” said Peter. “I say, I am glad I thought about something red, and waving it.” “How lucky we DID put on our red flannel petticoats!” said Phyllis. Bobbie said nothing. She was thinking of the horrible mound, and the trustful train rushing towards it. “And it was US that saved them,” said Peter. “How dreadful if they had all been killed!” said Phyllis; “wouldn't it, Bobbie?” “We never got any cherries, after all,” said Bobbie. The others thought her rather heartless. Chapter VII. For valour. I hope you don't mind my telling you a good deal about Roberta. The fact is I am growing very fond of her. The more I observe her the more I love her. And I notice all sorts of things about her that I like. For instance, she was quite oddly anxious to make other people happy. And she could keep a secret, a tolerably rare accomplishment. Also she had the power of silent sympathy. That sounds rather dull, I know, but it's not so dull as it sounds. It just means that a person is able to know that you are unhappy, and to love you extra on that account, without bothering you by telling you all the time how sorry she is for you. That was what Bobbie was like. She knew that Mother was unhappy, and that Mother had not told her the reason. So she just loved Mother more and never said a single word that could let Mother know how earnestly her little girl wondered what Mother was unhappy about. This needs practice. It is not so easy as you might think. Whatever happened, and all sorts of nice, pleasant ordinary things happened, such as picnics, games, and buns for tea, Bobbie always had these thoughts at the back of her mind. “Mother's unhappy. Why? I don't know. She doesn't want me to know. I won't try to find out. But she IS unhappy. Why? I don't know. She doesn't, ” and so on, repeating and repeating like a tune that you don't know the stopping part of. The Russian gentleman still took up a good deal of everybody's thoughts. All the editors and secretaries of Societies and Members of Parliament had answered Mother's letters as politely as they knew how; but none of them could tell where the wife and children of Mr. Szezcpansky would be likely to be. (Did I tell you that the Russian's very Russian name was that?) Bobbie had another quality which you will hear differently described by different people. Some of them call it interfering in other people's business, and some call it “helping lame dogs over stiles,” and some call it “loving-kindness.” It just means trying to help people. She racked her brains to think of some way of helping the Russian gentleman to find his wife and children. He had learned a few words of English now. He could say “Good morning,” and “Good night,” and “Please,” and “Thank you,” and “Pretty,” when the children brought him flowers, and “Ver' good,” when they asked him how he had slept. The way he smiled when he “said his English,” was, Bobbie felt, “just too sweet for anything.” She used to think of his face because she fancied it would help her to some way of helping him. But it did not. Yet his being there cheered her because she saw that it made Mother happier. “She likes to have someone to be good to, even beside us,” said Bobbie. “And I know she hated to let him have Father's clothes. But I suppose it 'hurt nice,' or she wouldn't have.” For many and many a night after the day when she and Peter and Phyllis had saved the train from wreck by waving their little red flannel flags, Bobbie used to wake screaming and shivering, seeing again that horrible mound, and the poor, dear trustful engine rushing on towards it, just thinking that it was doing its swift duty, and that everything was clear and safe. And then a warm thrill of pleasure used to run through her at the remembrance of how she and Peter and Phyllis and the red flannel petticoats had really saved everybody. One morning a letter came. It was addressed to Peter and Bobbie and Phyllis. They opened it with enthusiastic curiosity, for they did not often get letters. The letter said:,  “Dear Sir, and Ladies,, It is proposed to make a small presentation to you, in commemoration of your prompt and courageous action in warning the train on the , - inst., and thus averting what must, humanly speaking, have been a terrible accident. The presentation will take place at the , - Station at three o'clock on the 30th inst., if this time and place will be convenient to you.           “Yours faithfully,                     “Jabez Inglewood. “Secretary, Great Northern and Southern Railway Co.” There never had been a prouder moment in the lives of the three children. They rushed to Mother with the letter, and she also felt proud and said so, and this made the children happier than ever. “But if the presentation is money, you must say, 'Thank you, but we'd rather not take it,'” said Mother. “I'll wash your Indian muslins at once,” she added. “You must look tidy on an occasion like this.” “Phil and I can wash them,” said Bobbie, “if you'll iron them, Mother.” Washing is rather fun. I wonder whether you've ever done it? This particular washing took place in the back kitchen, which had a stone floor and a very big stone sink under its window. “Let's put the bath on the sink,” said Phyllis; “then we can pretend we're out-of-doors washerwomen like Mother saw in France.” “But they were washing in the cold river,” said Peter, his hands in his pockets, “not in hot water.” “This is a HOT river, then,” said Phyllis; “lend a hand with the bath, there's a dear.” “I should like to see a deer lending a hand,” said Peter, but he lent his. “Now to rub and scrub and scrub and rub,” said Phyllis, hopping joyously about as Bobbie carefully carried the heavy kettle from the kitchen fire. “Oh, no!” said Bobbie, greatly shocked; “you don't rub muslin. You put the boiled soap in the hot water and make it all frothy-lathery, and then you shake the muslin and squeeze it, ever so gently, and all the dirt comes out. It's only clumsy things like tablecloths and sheets that have to be rubbed.” The lilac and the Gloire de Dijon roses outside the window swayed in the soft breeze. “It's a nice drying day, that's one thing,” said Bobbie, feeling very grown up. “Oh, I do wonder what wonderful feelings we shall have when we WEAR the Indian muslin dresses!” “Yes, so do I,” said Phyllis, shaking and squeezing the muslin in quite a professional manner. “NOW we squeeze out the soapy water. NO, we mustn't twist them, and then rinse them. I'll hold them while you and Peter empty the bath and get clean water.” “A presentation! That means presents,” said Peter, as his sisters, having duly washed the pegs and wiped the line, hung up the dresses to dry. “Whatever will it be?” “It might be anything,” said Phyllis; “what I've always wanted is a Baby elephant, but I suppose they wouldn't know that.” “Suppose it was gold models of steam-engines?” said Bobbie. “Or a big model of the scene of the prevented accident,” suggested Peter, “with a little model train, and dolls dressed like us and the engine-driver and fireman and passengers.” “Do you LIKE,” said Bobbie, doubtfully, drying her hands on the rough towel that hung on a roller at the back of the scullery door, “do you LIKE us being rewarded for saving a train?” “Yes, I do,” said Peter, downrightly; “and don't you try to come it over us that you don't like it, too. Because I know you do.” “Yes,” said Bobbie, doubtfully, “I know I do. But oughtn't we to be satisfied with just having done it, and not ask for anything more?” “Who did ask for anything more, silly?” said her brother; “Victoria Cross soldiers don't ASK for it; but they're glad enough to get it all the same. Perhaps it'll be medals. Then, when I'm very old indeed, I shall show them to my grandchildren and say, 'We only did our duty,' and they'll be awfully proud of me.” “You have to be married,” warned Phyllis, “or you don't have any grandchildren.” “I suppose I shall HAVE to be married some day,” said Peter, “but it will be an awful bother having her round all the time. I'd like to marry a lady who had trances, and only woke up once or twice a year.” “Just to say you were the light of her life and then go to sleep again. Yes. That wouldn't be bad,” said Bobbie. “When  I  get married,” said Phyllis, “I shall want him to want me to be awake all the time, so that I can hear him say how nice I am.” “I think it would be nice,” said Bobbie, “to marry someone very poor, and then you'd do all the work and he'd love you most frightfully, and see the blue wood smoke curling up among the trees from the domestic hearth as he came home from work every night. I say, we've got to answer that letter and say that the time and place WILL be convenient to us. There's the soap, Peter. WE'RE both as clean as clean. That pink box of writing paper you had on your birthday, Phil.” It took some time to arrange what should be said. Mother had gone back to her writing, and several sheets of pink paper with scalloped gilt edges and green four-leaved shamrocks in the corner were spoiled before the three had decided what to say. Then each made a copy and signed it with its own name. The threefold letter ran:,  “Dear Mr. Jabez Inglewood,, Thank you very much. We did not want to be rewarded but only to save the train, but we are glad you think so and thank you very much. The time and place you say will be quite convenient to us. Thank you very much.           “Your affecate little friend,” Then came the name, and after it:,  “P.S. Thank you very much.” “Washing is much easier than ironing,” said Bobbie, taking the clean dry dresses off the line. “I do love to see things come clean. Oh, I don't know how we shall wait till it's time to know what presentation they're going to present!” When at last, it seemed a very long time after, it was THE day, the three children went down to the station at the proper time. And everything that happened was so odd that it seemed like a dream. The Station Master came out to meet them, in his best clothes, as Peter noticed at once, and led them into the waiting room where once they had played the advertisement game. It looked quite different now. A carpet had been put down, and there were pots of roses on the mantelpiece and on the window ledges, green branches stuck up, like holly and laurel are at Christmas, over the framed advertisement of Cook's Tours and the Beauties of Devon and the Paris Lyons Railway. There were quite a number of people there besides the Porter, two or three ladies in smart dresses, and quite a crowd of gentlemen in high hats and frock coats, besides everybody who belonged to the station. They recognized several people who had been in the train on the red-flannel-petticoat day. Best of all their own old gentleman was there, and his coat and hat and collar seemed more than ever different from anyone else's. He shook hands with them and then everybody sat down on chairs, and a gentleman in spectacles, they found out afterwards that he was the District Superintendent, began quite a long speech, very clever indeed. I am not going to write the speech down. First, because you would think it dull; and secondly, because it made all the children blush so, and get so hot about the ears that I am quite anxious to get away from this part of the subject; and thirdly, because the gentleman took so many words to say what he had to say that I really haven't time to write them down. He said all sorts of nice things about the children's bravery and presence of mind, and when he had done he sat down, and everyone who was there clapped and said, “Hear, hear.” And then the old gentleman got up and said things, too. It was very like a prize-giving. And then he called the children one by one, by their names, and gave each of them a beautiful gold watch and chain. And inside the watches were engraved after the name of the watch's new owner:,  “From the Directors of the Northern and Southern Railway in grateful recognition of the courageous and prompt action which averted an accident on , - 1905.” The watches were the most beautiful you can possibly imagine, and each one had a blue leather case to live in when it was at home. “You must make a speech now and thank everyone for their kindness,”  whispered the Station Master in Peter's ear and pushed him forward. “Begin 'Ladies and Gentlemen,'” he added. Each of the children had already said “Thank you,” quite properly. “Oh, dear,” said Peter, but he did not resist the push. “Ladies and Gentlemen,” he said in a rather husky voice. Then there was a pause, and he heard his heart beating in his throat. “Ladies and Gentlemen,” he went on with a rush, “it's most awfully good of you, and we shall treasure the watches all our lives, but really we don't deserve it because what we did wasn't anything, really. At least, I mean it was awfully exciting, and what I mean to say, thank you all very, very much.” The people clapped Peter more than they had done the District Superintendent, and then everybody shook hands with them, and as soon as politeness would let them, they got away, and tore up the hill to Three Chimneys with their watches in their hands. It was a wonderful day, the kind of day that very seldom happens to anybody and to most of us not at all. “I did want to talk to the old gentleman about something else,” said Bobbie, “but it was so public, like being in church.” “What did you want to say?” asked Phyllis. “I'll tell you when I've thought about it more,” said Bobbie. So when she had thought a little more she wrote a letter. “My dearest old gentleman,” it said; “I want most awfully to ask you something. If you could get out of the train and go by the next, it would do. I do not want you to give me anything. Mother says we ought not to. And besides, we do not want any THINGS. Only to talk to you about a Prisoner and Captive. Your loving little friend,           “Bobbie.” She got the Station Master to give the letter to the old gentleman, and next day she asked Peter and Phyllis to come down to the station with her at the time when the train that brought the old gentleman from town would be passing through. She explained her idea to them, and they approved thoroughly. They had all washed their hands and faces, and brushed their hair, and were looking as tidy as they knew how. But Phyllis, always unlucky, had upset a jug of lemonade down the front of her dress. There was no time to change, and the wind happening to blow from the coal yard, her frock was soon powdered with grey, which stuck to the sticky lemonade stains and made her look, as Peter said, “like any little gutter child.” It was decided that she should keep behind the others as much as possible. “Perhaps the old gentleman won't notice,” said Bobbie. “The aged are often weak in the eyes.” There was no sign of weakness, however, in the eyes, or in any other part of the old gentleman, as he stepped from the train and looked up and down the platform. The three children, now that it came to the point, suddenly felt that rush of deep shyness which makes your ears red and hot, your hands warm and wet, and the tip of your nose pink and shiny. “Oh,” said Phyllis, “my heart's thumping like a steam-engine, right under my sash, too.” “Nonsense,” said Peter, “people's hearts aren't under their sashes.” “I don't care, mine is,” said Phyllis. “If you're going to talk like a poetry-book,” said Peter, “my heart's in my mouth.” “My heart's in my boots, if you come to that,” said Roberta; “but do come on, he'll think we're idiots.” “He won't be far wrong,” said Peter, gloomily. And they went forward to meet the old gentleman. “Hullo,” he said, shaking hands with them all in turn. “This is a very great pleasure.” “It WAS good of you to get out,” Bobbie said, perspiring and polite. He took her arm and drew her into the waiting room where she and the others had played the advertisement game the day they found the Russian. Phyllis and Peter followed. “Well?” said the old gentleman, giving Bobbie's arm a kind little shake before he let it go. “Well? What is it?” “Oh, please!” said Bobbie. “Yes?” said the old gentleman. “What I mean to say, ” said Bobbie. “Well?” said the old gentleman. “It's all very nice and kind,” said she. “But?” he said. “I wish I might say something,” she said. “Say it,” said he. “Well, then,” said Bobbie, and out came the story of the Russian who had written the beautiful book about poor people, and had been sent to prison and to Siberia for just that. “And what we want more than anything in the world is to find his wife and children for him,” said Bobbie, “but we don't know how. But you must be most horribly clever, or you wouldn't be a Direction of the Railway. And if YOU knew how, and would? We'd rather have that than anything else in the world. We'd go without the watches, even, if you could sell them and find his wife with the money.” And the others said so, too, though not with so much enthusiasm. “Hum,” said the old gentleman, pulling down the white waistcoat that had the big gilt buttons on it, “what did you say the name was, Fryingpansky?” “No, no,” said Bobbie earnestly. “I'll write it down for you. It doesn't really look at all like that except when you say it. Have you a bit of pencil and the back of an envelope?” she asked. The old gentleman got out a gold pencil-case and a beautiful, sweet-smelling, green Russian leather note-book and opened it at a new page. “Here,” he said, “write here.” She wrote down “Szezcpansky,” and said:,  “That's how you write it. You CALL it Shepansky.” The old gentleman took out a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles and fitted them on his nose. When he had read the name, he looked quite different. “THAT man? Bless my soul!” he said. “Why, I've read his book! It's translated into every European language. A fine book, a noble book. And so your mother took him in, like the good Samaritan. Well, well. I'll tell you what, youngsters, your mother must be a very good woman.” “Of course she is,” said Phyllis, in astonishment. “And you're a very good man,” said Bobbie, very shy, but firmly resolved to be polite. “You flatter me,” said the old gentleman, taking off his hat with a flourish. “And now am I to tell you what I think of you?” “Oh, please don't,” said Bobbie, hastily. “Why?” asked the old gentleman. “I don't exactly know,” said Bobbie. “Only, if it's horrid, I don't want you to; and if it's nice, I'd rather you didn't.” The old gentleman laughed. “Well, then,” he said, “I'll only just say that I'm very glad you came to me about this, very glad, indeed. And I shouldn't be surprised if I found out something very soon. I know a great many Russians in London, and every Russian knows HIS name. Now tell me all about yourselves.” He turned to the others, but there was only one other, and that was Peter. Phyllis had disappeared. “Tell me all about yourself,” said the old gentleman again. And, quite naturally, Peter was stricken dumb. “All right, we'll have an examination,” said the old gentleman; “you two sit on the table, and I'll sit on the bench and ask questions.” He did, and out came their names and ages, their Father's name and business, how long they had lived at Three Chimneys and a great deal more. The questions were beginning to turn on a herring and a half for three halfpence, and a pound of lead and a pound of feathers, when the door of the waiting room was kicked open by a boot; as the boot entered everyone could see that its lace was coming undone, and in came Phyllis, very slowly and carefully. In one hand she carried a large tin can, and in the other a thick slice of bread and butter. “Afternoon tea,” she announced proudly, and held the can and the bread and butter out to the old gentleman, who took them and said:,  “Bless my soul!” “Yes,” said Phyllis. “It's very thoughtful of you,” said the old gentleman, “very.” “But you might have got a cup,” said Bobbie, “and a plate.” “Perks always drinks out of the can,” said Phyllis, flushing red. “I think it was very nice of him to give it me at all, let alone cups and plates,” she added. “So do I,” said the old gentleman, and he drank some of the tea and tasted the bread and butter. And then it was time for the next train, and he got into it with many good-byes and kind last words. “Well,” said Peter, when they were left on the platform, and the tail-lights of the train disappeared round the corner, “it's my belief that we've lighted a candle to-day, like Latimer, you know, when he was being burned, and there'll be fireworks for our Russian before long.” And so there were. It wasn't ten days after the interview in the waiting room that the three children were sitting on the top of the biggest rock in the field below their house watching the 5.15 steam away from the station along the bottom of the valley. They saw, too, the few people who had got out at the station straggling up the road towards the village, and they saw one person leave the road and open the gate that led across the fields to Three Chimneys and to nowhere else. “Who on earth!” said Peter, scrambling down. “Let's go and see,” said Phyllis. So they did. And when they got near enough to see who the person was, they saw it was their old gentleman himself, his brass buttons winking in the afternoon sunshine, and his white waistcoat looking whiter than ever against the green of the field. “Hullo!” shouted the children, waving their hands. “Hullo!” shouted the old gentleman, waving his hat. Then the three started to run, and when they got to him they hardly had breath left to say:,  “How do you do?” “Good news,” said he. “I've found your Russian friend's wife and child, and I couldn't resist the temptation of giving myself the pleasure of telling him.” But as he looked at Bobbie's face he felt that he COULD resist that temptation. “Here,” he said to her, “you run on and tell him. The other two will show me the way.” Bobbie ran. But when she had breathlessly panted out the news to the Russian and Mother sitting in the quiet garden, when Mother's face had lighted up so beautifully, and she had said half a dozen quick French words to the Exile, Bobbie wished that she had NOT carried the news. For the Russian sprang up with a cry that made Bobbie's heart leap and then tremble, a cry of love and longing such as she had never heard. Then he took Mother's hand and kissed it gently and reverently, and then he sank down in his chair and covered his face with his hands and sobbed. Bobbie crept away. She did not want to see the others just then. But she was as gay as anybody when the endless French talking was over, when Peter had torn down to the village for buns and cakes, and the girls had got tea ready and taken it out into the garden. The old gentleman was most merry and delightful. He seemed to be able to talk in French and English almost at the same moment, and Mother did nearly as well. It was a delightful time. Mother seemed as if she could not make enough fuss about the old gentleman, and she said yes at once when he asked if he might present some “goodies” to his little friends. The word was new to the children, but they guessed that it meant sweets, for the three large pink and green boxes, tied with green ribbon, which he took out of his bag, held unheard-of layers of beautiful chocolates. The Russian's few belongings were packed, and they all saw him off at the station. Then Mother turned to the old gentleman and said:,  “I don't know how to thank you for EVERYTHING. It has been a real pleasure to me to see you. But we live very quietly. I am so sorry that I can't ask you to come and see us again.” The children thought this very hard. When they HAD made a friend, and such a friend, they would dearly have liked him to come and see them again. What the old gentleman thought they couldn't tell. He only said:,  “I consider myself very fortunate, Madam, to have been received once at your house.” “Ah,” said Mother, “I know I must seem surly and ungrateful, but, ” “You could never seem anything but a most charming and gracious lady,”  said the old gentleman, with another of his bows. And as they turned to go up the hill, Bobbie saw her Mother's face. “How tired you look, Mammy,” she said; “lean on me.” “It's my place to give Mother my arm,” said Peter. “I'm the head man of the family when Father's away.” Mother took an arm of each. “How awfully nice,” said Phyllis, skipping joyfully, “to think of the dear Russian embracing his long-lost wife. The baby must have grown a lot since he saw it.” “Yes,” said Mother. “I wonder whether Father will think I'VE grown,” Phyllis went on, skipping still more gaily. “I have grown already, haven't I, Mother?” “Yes,” said Mother, “oh, yes,” and Bobbie and Peter felt her hands tighten on their arms. “Poor old Mammy, you ARE tired,” said Peter. Bobbie said, “Come on, Phil; I'll race you to the gate.” And she started the race, though she hated doing it. YOU know why Bobbie did that. Mother only thought that Bobbie was tired of walking slowly. Even Mothers, who love you better than anyone else ever will, don't always understand. Chapter VIII. The amateur firemen. “That's a likely little brooch you've got on, Miss,” said Perks the Porter; “I don't know as ever I see a thing more like a buttercup without it WAS a buttercup.” “Yes,” said Bobbie, glad and flushed by this approval. “I always thought it was more like a buttercup almost than even a real one, and I NEVER thought it would come to be mine, my very own, and then Mother gave it to me for my birthday.” “Oh, have you had a birthday?” said Perks; and he seemed quite surprised, as though a birthday were a thing only granted to a favoured few. “Yes,” said Bobbie; “when's your birthday, Mr. Perks?” The children were taking tea with Mr. Perks in the Porters' room among the lamps and the railway almanacs. They had brought their own cups and some jam turnovers. Mr. Perks made tea in a beer can, as usual, and everyone felt very happy and confidential. “My birthday?” said Perks, tipping some more dark brown tea out of the can into Peter's cup. “I give up keeping of my birthday afore you was born.” “But you must have been born SOMETIME, you know,” said Phyllis, thoughtfully, “even if it was twenty years ago, or thirty or sixty or seventy.” “Not so long as that, Missie,” Perks grinned as he answered. “If you really want to know, it was thirty-two years ago, come the fifteenth of this month.” “Then why don't you keep it?” asked Phyllis. “I've got something else to keep besides birthdays,” said Perks, briefly. “Oh! What?” asked Phyllis, eagerly. “Not secrets?” “No,” said Perks, “the kids and the Missus.” It was this talk that set the children thinking, and, presently, talking. Perks was, on the whole, the dearest friend they had made. Not so grand as the Station Master, but more approachable, less powerful than the old gentleman, but more confidential. “It seems horrid that nobody keeps his birthday,” said Bobbie. “Couldn't WE do something?” “Let's go up to the Canal bridge and talk it over,” said Peter. “I got a new gut line from the postman this morning. He gave it me for a bunch of roses that I gave him for his sweetheart. She's ill.” “Then I do think you might have given her the roses for nothing,” said Bobbie, indignantly. “Nyang, nyang!” said Peter, disagreeably, and put his hands in his pockets. “He did, of course,” said Phyllis, in haste; “directly we heard she was ill we got the roses ready and waited by the gate. It was when you were making the brekker-toast. And when he'd said 'Thank you' for the roses so many times, much more than he need have, he pulled out the line and gave it to Peter. It wasn't exchange. It was the grateful heart.” “Oh, I BEG your pardon, Peter,” said Bobbie, “I AM so sorry.” “Don't mention it,” said Peter, grandly, “I knew you would be.” So then they all went up to the Canal bridge. The idea was to fish from the bridge, but the line was not quite long enough. “Never mind,” said Bobbie. “Let's just stay here and look at things. Everything's so beautiful.” It was. The sun was setting in red splendour over the grey and purple hills, and the canal lay smooth and shiny in the shadow, no ripple broke its surface. It was like a grey satin ribbon between the dusky green silk of the meadows that were on each side of its banks. “It's all right,” said Peter, “but somehow I can always see how pretty things are much better when I've something to do. Let's get down on to the towpath and fish from there.” Phyllis and Bobbie remembered how the boys on the canal-boats had thrown coal at them, and they said so. “Oh, nonsense,” said Peter. “There aren't any boys here now. If there were, I'd fight them.” Peter's sisters were kind enough not to remind him how he had NOT fought the boys when coal had last been thrown. Instead they said, “All right, then,” and cautiously climbed down the steep bank to the towing-path. The line was carefully baited, and for half an hour they fished patiently and in vain. Not a single nibble came to nourish hope in their hearts. All eyes were intent on the sluggish waters that earnestly pretended they had never harboured a single minnow when a loud rough shout made them start. “Hi!” said the shout, in most disagreeable tones, “get out of that, can't you?” An old white horse coming along the towing-path was within half a dozen yards of them. They sprang to their feet and hastily climbed up the bank. “We'll slip down again when they've gone by,” said Bobbie. But, alas, the barge, after the manner of barges, stopped under the bridge. “She's going to anchor,” said Peter; “just our luck!” The barge did not anchor, because an anchor is not part of a canal-boat's furniture, but she was moored with ropes fore and aft, and the ropes were made fast to the palings and to crowbars driven into the ground. “What you staring at?” growled the Bargee, crossly. “We weren't staring,” said Bobbie; “we wouldn't be so rude.” “Rude be blessed,” said the man; “get along with you!” “Get along yourself,” said Peter. He remembered what he had said about fighting boys, and, besides, he felt safe halfway up the bank. “We've as much right here as anyone else.” “Oh, 'AVE you, indeed!” said the man. “We'll soon see about that.” And he came across his deck and began to climb down the side of his barge. “Oh, come away, Peter, come away!” said Bobbie and Phyllis, in agonised unison. “Not me,” said Peter, “but YOU'D better.” The girls climbed to the top of the bank and stood ready to bolt for home as soon as they saw their brother out of danger. The way home lay all down hill. They knew that they all ran well. The Bargee did not look as if HE did. He was red-faced, heavy, and beefy. But as soon as his foot was on the towing-path the children saw that they had misjudged him. He made one spring up the bank and caught Peter by the leg, dragged him down, set him on his feet with a shake, took him by the ear, and said sternly:,  “Now, then, what do you mean by it? Don't you know these 'ere waters is preserved? You ain't no right catching fish 'ere, not to say nothing of your precious cheek.” Peter was always proud afterwards when he remembered that, with the Bargee's furious fingers tightening on his ear, the Bargee's crimson countenance close to his own, the Bargee's hot breath on his neck, he had the courage to speak the truth. “I WASN'T catching fish,” said Peter. “That's not YOUR fault, I'll be bound,” said the man, giving Peter's ear a twist, not a hard one, but still a twist. Peter could not say that it was. Bobbie and Phyllis had been holding on to the railings above and skipping with anxiety. Now suddenly Bobbie slipped through the railings and rushed down the bank towards Peter, so impetuously that Phyllis, following more temperately, felt certain that her sister's descent would end in the waters of the canal. And so it would have done if the Bargee hadn't let go of Peter's ear, and caught her in his jerseyed arm. “Who are you a-shoving of?” he said, setting her on her feet. “Oh,” said Bobbie, breathless, “I'm not shoving anybody. At least, not on purpose. Please don't be cross with Peter. Of course, if it's your canal, we're sorry and we won't any more. But we didn't know it was yours.” “Go along with you,” said the Bargee. “Yes, we will; indeed we will,” said Bobbie, earnestly; “but we do beg your pardon, and really we haven't caught a single fish. I'd tell you directly if we had, honour bright I would.” She held out her hands and Phyllis turned out her little empty pocket to show that really they hadn't any fish concealed about them. “Well,” said the Bargee, more gently, “cut along, then, and don't you do it again, that's all.” The children hurried up the bank. “Chuck us a coat, M'ria,” shouted the man. And a red-haired woman in a green plaid shawl came out from the cabin door with a baby in her arms and threw a coat to him. He put it on, climbed the bank, and slouched along across the bridge towards the village. “You'll find me up at the 'Rose and Crown' when you've got the kid to sleep,” he called to her from the bridge. When he was out of sight the children slowly returned. Peter insisted on this. “The canal may belong to him,” he said, “though I don't believe it does. But the bridge is everybody's. Doctor Forrest told me it's public property. I'm not going to be bounced off the bridge by him or anyone else, so I tell you.” Peter's ear was still sore and so were his feelings. The girls followed him as gallant soldiers might follow the leader of a forlorn hope. “I do wish you wouldn't,” was all they said. “Go home if you're afraid,” said Peter; “leave me alone. I'M not afraid.” The sound of the man's footsteps died away along the quiet road. The peace of the evening was not broken by the notes of the sedge-warblers or by the voice of the woman in the barge, singing her baby to sleep. It was a sad song she sang. Something about Bill Bailey and how she wanted him to come home. The children stood leaning their arms on the parapet of the bridge; they were glad to be quiet for a few minutes because all three hearts were beating much more quickly. “I'm not going to be driven away by any old bargeman, I'm not,” said Peter, thickly. “Of course not,” Phyllis said soothingly; “you didn't give in to him! So now we might go home, don't you think?” “NO,” said Peter. Nothing more was said till the woman got off the barge, climbed the bank, and came across the bridge. She hesitated, looking at the three backs of the children, then she said, “Ahem.” Peter stayed as he was, but the girls looked round. “You mustn't take no notice of my Bill,” said the woman; “'is bark's worse'n 'is bite. Some of the kids down Farley way is fair terrors. It was them put 'is back up calling out about who ate the puppy-pie under Marlow bridge.” “Who DID?” asked Phyllis. “ I  dunno,” said the woman. “Nobody don't know! But somehow, and I don't know the why nor the wherefore of it, them words is p'ison to a barge-master. Don't you take no notice. 'E won't be back for two hours good. You might catch a power o' fish afore that. The light's good an' all,” she added. “Thank you,” said Bobbie. “You're very kind. Where's your baby?” “Asleep in the cabin,” said the woman. “'E's all right. Never wakes afore twelve. Reg'lar as a church clock, 'e is.” “I'm sorry,” said Bobbie; “I would have liked to see him, close to.” “And a finer you never did see, Miss, though I says it.” The woman's face brightened as she spoke. “Aren't you afraid to leave it?” said Peter. “Lor' love you, no,” said the woman; “who'd hurt a little thing like 'im? Besides, Spot's there. So long!” The woman went away. “Shall we go home?” said Phyllis. “You can. I'm going to fish,” said Peter briefly. “I thought we came up here to talk about Perks's birthday,” said Phyllis. “Perks's birthday'll keep.” So they got down on the towing-path again and Peter fished. He did not catch anything. It was almost quite dark, the girls were getting tired, and as Bobbie said, it was past bedtime, when suddenly Phyllis cried, “What's that?” And she pointed to the canal boat. Smoke was coming from the chimney of the cabin, had indeed been curling softly into the soft evening air all the time, but now other wreaths of smoke were rising, and these were from the cabin door. “It's on fire, that's all,” said Peter, calmly. “Serve him right.” “Oh, how CAN you?” cried Phyllis. “Think of the poor dear dog.” “The BABY!” screamed Bobbie. In an instant all three made for the barge. Her mooring ropes were slack, and the little breeze, hardly strong enough to be felt, had yet been strong enough to drift her stern against the bank. Bobbie was first, then came Peter, and it was Peter who slipped and fell. He went into the canal up to his neck, and his feet could not feel the bottom, but his arm was on the edge of the barge. Phyllis caught at his hair. It hurt, but it helped him to get out. Next minute he had leaped on to the barge, Phyllis following. “Not you!” he shouted to Bobbie; “ME, because I'm wet.” He caught up with Bobbie at the cabin door, and flung her aside very roughly indeed; if they had been playing, such roughness would have made Bobbie weep with tears of rage and pain. Now, though he flung her on to the edge of the hold, so that her knee and her elbow were grazed and bruised, she only cried:,  “No, not you, ME,” and struggled up again. But not quickly enough. Peter had already gone down two of the cabin steps into the cloud of thick smoke. He stopped, remembered all he had ever heard of fires, pulled his soaked handkerchief out of his breast pocket and tied it over his mouth. As he pulled it out he said:,  “It's all right, hardly any fire at all.” And this, though he thought it was a lie, was rather good of Peter. It was meant to keep Bobbie from rushing after him into danger. Of course it didn't. The cabin glowed red. A paraffin lamp was burning calmly in an orange mist. “Hi,” said Peter, lifting the handkerchief from his mouth for a moment. “Hi, Baby, where are you?” He choked. “Oh, let ME go,” cried Bobbie, close behind him. Peter pushed her back more roughly than before, and went on. Now what would have happened if the baby hadn't cried I don't know, but just at that moment it DID cry. Peter felt his way through the dark smoke, found something small and soft and warm and alive, picked it up and backed out, nearly tumbling over Bobbie who was close behind. A dog snapped at his leg, tried to bark, choked. “I've got the kid,” said Peter, tearing off the handkerchief and staggering on to the deck. Bobbie caught at the place where the bark came from, and her hands met on the fat back of a smooth-haired dog. It turned and fastened its teeth on her hand, but very gently, as much as to say:,  “I'm bound to bark and bite if strangers come into my master's cabin, but I know you mean well, so I won't REALLY bite.” Bobbie dropped the dog. “All right, old man. Good dog,” said she. “Here, give me the baby, Peter; you're so wet you'll give it cold.” Peter was only too glad to hand over the strange little bundle that squirmed and whimpered in his arms. “Now,” said Bobbie, quickly, “you run straight to the 'Rose and Crown' and tell them. Phil and I will stay here with the precious. Hush, then, a dear, a duck, a darling! Go NOW, Peter! Run!” “I can't run in these things,” said Peter, firmly; “they're as heavy as lead. I'll walk.” “Then I'LL run,” said Bobbie. “Get on the bank, Phil, and I'll hand you the dear.” The baby was carefully handed. Phyllis sat down on the bank and tried to hush the baby. Peter wrung the water from his sleeves and knickerbocker legs as well as he could, and it was Bobbie who ran like the wind across the bridge and up the long white quiet twilight road towards the 'Rose and Crown.' There is a nice old-fashioned room at the 'Rose and Crown; where Bargees and their wives sit of an evening drinking their supper beer, and toasting their supper cheese at a glowing basketful of coals that sticks out into the room under a great hooded chimney and is warmer and prettier and more comforting than any other fireplace  I  ever saw. There was a pleasant party of barge people round the fire. You might not have thought it pleasant, but they did; for they were all friends or acquaintances, and they liked the same sort of things, and talked the same sort of talk. This is the real secret of pleasant society. The Bargee Bill, whom the children had found so disagreeable, was considered excellent company by his mates. He was telling a tale of his own wrongs, always a thrilling subject. It was his barge he was speaking about. “And 'e sent down word 'paint her inside hout,' not namin' no colour, d'ye see? So I gets a lotter green paint and I paints her stem to stern, and I tell yer she looked A1. Then 'E comes along and 'e says, 'Wot yer paint 'er all one colour for?' 'e says. And I says, says I, 'Cause I thought she'd look fust-rate,' says I, 'and I think so still.' An' he says, 'DEW yer? Then ye can just pay for the bloomin' paint yerself,' says he. An' I 'ad to, too.” A murmur of sympathy ran round the room. Breaking noisily in on it came Bobbie. She burst open the swing door, crying breathlessly:,  “Bill! I want Bill the Bargeman.” There was a stupefied silence. Pots of beer were held in mid-air, paralysed on their way to thirsty mouths. “Oh,” said Bobbie, seeing the bargewoman and making for her. “Your barge cabin's on fire. Go quickly.” The woman started to her feet, and put a big red hand to her waist, on the left side, where your heart seems to be when you are frightened or miserable. “Reginald Horace!” she cried in a terrible voice; “my Reginald Horace!” “All right,” said Bobbie, “if you mean the baby; got him out safe. Dog, too.” She had no breath for more, except, “Go on, it's all alight.” Then she sank on the ale-house bench and tried to get that breath of relief after running which people call the 'second wind.' But she felt as though she would never breathe again. Bill the Bargee rose slowly and heavily. But his wife was a hundred yards up the road before he had quite understood what was the matter. Phyllis, shivering by the canal side, had hardly heard the quick approaching feet before the woman had flung herself on the railing, rolled down the bank, and snatched the baby from her. “Don't,” said Phyllis, reproachfully; “I'd just got him to sleep.”                                                                    Bill came up later talking in a language with which the children were wholly unfamiliar. He leaped on to the barge and dipped up pails of water. Peter helped him and they put out the fire. Phyllis, the bargewoman, and the baby, and presently Bobbie, too, cuddled together in a heap on the bank. “Lord help me, if it was me left anything as could catch alight,” said the woman again and again. But it wasn't she. It was Bill the Bargeman, who had knocked his pipe out and the red ash had fallen on the hearth-rug and smouldered there and at last broken into flame. Though a stern man he was just. He did not blame his wife for what was his own fault, as many bargemen, and other men, too, would have done.                                                                   Mother was half wild with anxiety when at last the three children turned up at Three Chimneys, all very wet by now, for Peter seemed to have come off on the others. But when she had disentangled the truth of what had happened from their mixed and incoherent narrative, she owned that they had done quite right, and could not possibly have done otherwise. Nor did she put any obstacles in the way of their accepting the cordial invitation with which the bargeman had parted from them. “Ye be here at seven to-morrow,” he had said, “and I'll take you the entire trip to Farley and back, so I will, and not a penny to pay. Nineteen locks!” They did not know what locks were; but they were at the bridge at seven, with bread and cheese and half a soda cake, and quite a quarter of a leg of mutton in a basket. It was a glorious day. The old white horse strained at the ropes, the barge glided smoothly and steadily through the still water. The sky was blue overhead. Mr. Bill was as nice as anyone could possibly be. No one would have thought that he could be the same man who had held Peter by the ear. As for Mrs. Bill, she had always been nice, as Bobbie said, and so had the baby, and even Spot, who might have bitten them quite badly if he had liked. “It was simply ripping, Mother,” said Peter, when they reached home very happy, very tired, and very dirty, “right over that glorious aqueduct. And locks, you don't know what they're like. You sink into the ground and then, when you feel you're never going to stop going down, two great black gates open slowly, slowly, you go out, and there you are on the canal just like you were before.” “I know,” said Mother, “there are locks on the Thames. Father and I used to go on the river at Marlow before we were married.” “And the dear, darling, ducky baby,” said Bobbie; “it let me nurse it for ages and ages, and it WAS so good. Mother, I wish we had a baby to play with.” “And everybody was so nice to us,” said Phyllis, “everybody we met. And they say we may fish whenever we like. And Bill is going to show us the way next time he's in these parts. He says we don't know really.” “He said YOU didn't know,” said Peter; “but, Mother, he said he'd tell all the bargees up and down the canal that we were the real, right sort, and they were to treat us like good pals, as we were.” “So then I said,” Phyllis interrupted, “we'd always each wear a red ribbon when we went fishing by the canal, so they'd know it was US, and we were the real, right sort, and be nice to us!” “So you've made another lot of friends,” said Mother; “first the railway and then the canal!” “Oh, yes,” said Bobbie; “I think everyone in the world is friends if you can only get them to see you don't want to be UN-friends.” “Perhaps you're right,” said Mother; and she sighed. “Come, Chicks. It's bedtime.” “Yes,” said Phyllis. “Oh dear, and we went up there to talk about what we'd do for Perks's birthday. And we haven't talked a single thing about it!” “No more we have,” said Bobbie; “but Peter's saved Reginald Horace's life. I think that's about good enough for one evening.” “Bobbie would have saved him if I hadn't knocked her down; twice I did,”  said Peter, loyally. “So would I,” said Phyllis, “if I'd known what to do.” “Yes,” said Mother, “you've saved a little child's life. I do think that's enough for one evening. Oh, my darlings, thank God YOU'RE all safe!” Chapter IX. The pride of Perks. It was breakfast-time. Mother's face was very bright as she poured the milk and ladled out the porridge. “I've sold another story, Chickies,” she said; “the one about the King of the Mussels, so there'll be buns for tea. You can go and get them as soon as they're baked. About eleven, isn't it?” Peter, Phyllis, and Bobbie exchanged glances with each other, six glances in all. Then Bobbie said:,  “Mother, would you mind if we didn't have the buns for tea to-night, but on the fifteenth? That's next Thursday.” “ I  don't mind when you have them, dear,” said Mother, “but why?” “Because it's Perks's birthday,” said Bobbie; “he's thirty-two, and he says he doesn't keep his birthday any more, because he's got other things to keep, not rabbits or secrets, but the kids and the missus.” “You mean his wife and children,” said Mother. “Yes,” said Phyllis; “it's the same thing, isn't it?” “And we thought we'd make a nice birthday for him. He's been so awfully jolly decent to us, you know, Mother,” said Peter, “and we agreed that next bun-day we'd ask you if we could.” “But suppose there hadn't been a bun-day before the fifteenth?” said Mother. “Oh, then, we meant to ask you to let us anti, antipate it, and go without when the bun-day came.” “Anticipate,” said Mother. “I see. Certainly. It would be nice to put his name on the buns with pink sugar, wouldn't it?” “Perks,” said Peter, “it's not a pretty name.” “His other name's Albert,” said Phyllis; “I asked him once.” “We might put A. P.,” said Mother; “I'll show you how when the day comes.” This was all very well as far as it went. But even fourteen halfpenny buns with A. P. on them in pink sugar do not of themselves make a very grand celebration. “There are always flowers, of course,” said Bobbie, later, when a really earnest council was being held on the subject in the hay-loft where the broken chaff-cutting machine was, and the row of holes to drop hay through into the hay-racks over the mangers of the stables below. “He's got lots of flowers of his own,” said Peter. “But it's always nice to have them given you,” said Bobbie, “however many you've got of your own. We can use flowers for trimmings to the birthday. But there must be something to trim besides buns.” “Let's all be quiet and think,” said Phyllis; “no one's to speak until it's thought of something.” So they were all quiet and so very still that a brown rat thought that there was no one in the loft and came out very boldly. When Bobbie sneezed, the rat was quite shocked and hurried away, for he saw that a hay-loft where such things could happen was no place for a respectable middle-aged rat that liked a quiet life. “Hooray!” cried Peter, suddenly, “I've got it.” He jumped up and kicked at the loose hay. “What?” said the others, eagerly. “Why, Perks is so nice to everybody. There must be lots of people in the village who'd like to help to make him a birthday. Let's go round and ask everybody.” “Mother said we weren't to ask people for things,” said Bobbie, doubtfully. “For ourselves, she meant, silly, not for other people. I'll ask the old gentleman too. You see if I don't,” said Peter. “Let's ask Mother first,” said Bobbie. “Oh, what's the use of bothering Mother about every little thing?”  said Peter, “especially when she's busy. Come on. Let's go down to the village now and begin.” So they went. The old lady at the Post-office said she didn't see why Perks should have a birthday any more than anyone else. “No,” said Bobbie, “I should like everyone to have one. Only we know when his is.” “Mine's to-morrow,” said the old lady, “and much notice anyone will take of it. Go along with you.” So they went. And some people were kind, and some were crusty. And some would give and some would not. It is rather difficult work asking for things, even for other people, as you have no doubt found if you have ever tried it. When the children got home and counted up what had been given and what had been promised, they felt that for the first day it was not so bad. Peter wrote down the lists of the things in the little pocket-book where he kept the numbers of his engines. These were the lists:,       GIVEN.      A tobacco pipe from the sweet shop.      Half a pound of tea from the grocer's.      A woollen scarf slightly faded from the draper's, which was the          other side of the grocer's.      A stuffed squirrel from the Doctor.      PROMISED.      A piece of meat from the butcher.      Six fresh eggs from the woman who lived in the old turnpike cottage.      A piece of honeycomb and six bootlaces from the cobbler, and an          iron shovel from the blacksmith's. Very early next morning Bobbie got up and woke Phyllis. This had been agreed on between them. They had not told Peter because they thought he would think it silly. But they told him afterwards, when it had turned out all right. They cut a big bunch of roses, and put it in a basket with the needle-book that Phyllis had made for Bobbie on her birthday, and a very pretty blue necktie of Phyllis's. Then they wrote on a paper: 'For Mrs. Ransome, with our best love, because it is her birthday,' and they put the paper in the basket, and they took it to the Post-office, and went in and put it on the counter and ran away before the old woman at the Post-office had time to get into her shop. When they got home Peter had grown confidential over helping Mother to get the breakfast and had told her their plans. “There's no harm in it,” said Mother, “but it depends HOW you do it. I only hope he won't be offended and think it's CHARITY. Poor people are very proud, you know.” “It isn't because he's poor,” said Phyllis; “it's because we're fond of him.” “I'll find some things that Phyllis has outgrown,” said Mother, “if you're quite sure you can give them to him without his being offended. I should like to do some little thing for him because he's been so kind to you. I can't do much because we're poor ourselves. What are you writing, Bobbie?” “Nothing particular,” said Bobbie, who had suddenly begun to scribble. “I'm sure he'd like the things, Mother.” The morning of the fifteenth was spent very happily in getting the buns and watching Mother make A. P. on them with pink sugar. You know how it's done, of course? You beat up whites of eggs and mix powdered sugar with them, and put in a few drops of cochineal. And then you make a cone of clean, white paper with a little hole at the pointed end, and put the pink egg-sugar in at the big end. It runs slowly out at the pointed end, and you write the letters with it just as though it were a great fat pen full of pink sugar-ink. The buns looked beautiful with A. P. on every one, and, when they were put in a cool oven to set the sugar, the children went up to the village to collect the honey and the shovel and the other promised things. The old lady at the Post-office was standing on her doorstep. The children said “Good morning,” politely, as they passed. “Here, stop a bit,” she said. So they stopped. “Those roses,” said she. “Did you like them?” said Phyllis; “they were as fresh as fresh.  I  made the needle-book, but it was Bobbie's present.” She skipped joyously as she spoke. “Here's your basket,” said the Post-office woman. She went in and brought out the basket. It was full of fat, red gooseberries. “I dare say Perks's children would like them,” said she. “You ARE an old dear,” said Phyllis, throwing her arms around the old lady's fat waist. “Perks WILL be pleased.” “He won't be half so pleased as I was with your needle-book and the tie and the pretty flowers and all,” said the old lady, patting Phyllis's shoulder. “You're good little souls, that you are. Look here. I've got a pram round the back in the wood-lodge. It was got for my Emmie's first, that didn't live but six months, and she never had but that one. I'd like Mrs. Perks to have it. It 'ud be a help to her with that great boy of hers. Will you take it along?” “OH!” said all the children together. When Mrs. Ransome had got out the perambulator and taken off the careful papers that covered it, and dusted it all over, she said:,  “Well, there it is. I don't know but what I'd have given it to her before if I'd thought of it. Only I didn't quite know if she'd accept of it from me. You tell her it was my Emmie's little one's pram, ” “Oh, ISN'T it nice to think there is going to be a real live baby in it again!” “Yes,” said Mrs. Ransome, sighing, and then laughing; “here, I'll give you some peppermint cushions for the little ones, and then you run along before I give you the roof off my head and the clothes off my back.” All the things that had been collected for Perks were packed into the perambulator, and at half-past three Peter and Bobbie and Phyllis wheeled it down to the little yellow house where Perks lived. The house was very tidy. On the window ledge was a jug of wild-flowers, big daisies, and red sorrel, and feathery, flowery grasses. There was a sound of splashing from the wash-house, and a partly washed boy put his head round the door. “Mother's a-changing of herself,” he said. “Down in a minute,” a voice sounded down the narrow, freshly scrubbed stairs. The children waited. Next moment the stairs creaked and Mrs. Perks came down, buttoning her bodice. Her hair was brushed very smooth and tight, and her face shone with soap and water. “I'm a bit late changing, Miss,” she said to Bobbie, “owing to me having had a extry clean-up to-day, along o' Perks happening to name its being his birthday. I don't know what put it into his head to think of such a thing. We keeps the children's birthdays, of course; but him and me, we're too old for such like, as a general rule.” “We knew it was his birthday,” said Peter, “and we've got some presents for him outside in the perambulator.” As the presents were being unpacked, Mrs. Perks gasped. When they were all unpacked, she surprised and horrified the children by sitting suddenly down on a wooden chair and bursting into tears. “Oh, don't!” said everybody; “oh, please don't!” And Peter added, perhaps a little impatiently: “What on earth is the matter? You don't mean to say you don't like it?” Mrs. Perks only sobbed. The Perks children, now as shiny-faced as anyone could wish, stood at the wash-house door, and scowled at the intruders. There was a silence, an awkward silence. “DON'T you like it?” said Peter, again, while his sisters patted Mrs. Perks on the back. She stopped crying as suddenly as she had begun. “There, there, don't you mind me. I'M all right!” she said. “Like it? Why, it's a birthday such as Perks never 'ad, not even when 'e was a boy and stayed with his uncle, who was a corn chandler in his own account. He failed afterwards. Like it? Oh, ” and then she went on and said all sorts of things that I won't write down, because I am sure that Peter and Bobbie and Phyllis would not like me to. Their ears got hotter and hotter, and their faces redder and redder, at the kind things Mrs. Perks said. They felt they had done nothing to deserve all this praise. At last Peter said: “Look here, we're glad you're pleased. But if you go on saying things like that, we must go home. And we did want to stay and see if Mr. Perks is pleased, too. But we can't stand this.” “I won't say another single word,” said Mrs. Perks, with a beaming face, “but that needn't stop me thinking, need it? For if ever, ” “Can we have a plate for the buns?” Bobbie asked abruptly. And then Mrs. Perks hastily laid the table for tea, and the buns and the honey and the gooseberries were displayed on plates, and the roses were put in two glass jam jars, and the tea-table looked, as Mrs. Perks said, “fit for a Prince.” “To think!” she said, “me getting the place tidy early, and the little 'uns getting the wild-flowers and all, when never did I think there'd be anything more for him except the ounce of his pet particular that I got o' Saturday and been saving up for 'im ever since. Bless us! 'e IS early!” Perks had indeed unlatched the latch of the little front gate. “Oh,” whispered Bobbie, “let's hide in the back kitchen, and YOU tell him about it. But give him the tobacco first, because you got it for him. And when you've told him, we'll all come in and shout, 'Many happy returns!'” It was a very nice plan, but it did not quite come off. To begin with, there was only just time for Peter and Bobbie and Phyllis to rush into the wash-house, pushing the young and open-mouthed Perks children in front of them. There was not time to shut the door, so that, without at all meaning it, they had to listen to what went on in the kitchen. The wash-house was a tight fit for the Perks children and the Three Chimneys children, as well as all the wash-house's proper furniture, including the mangle and the copper. “Hullo, old woman!” they heard Mr. Perks's voice say; “here's a pretty set-out!” “It's your birthday tea, Bert,” said Mrs. Perks, “and here's a ounce of your extry particular. I got it o' Saturday along o' your happening to remember it was your birthday to-day.” “Good old girl!” said Mr. Perks, and there was a sound of a kiss. “But what's that pram doing here? And what's all these bundles? And where did you get the sweetstuff, and, ” The children did not hear what Mrs. Perks replied, because just then Bobbie gave a start, put her hand in her pocket, and all her body grew stiff with horror. “Oh!” she whispered to the others, “whatever shall we do? I forgot to put the labels on any of the things! He won't know what's from who. He'll think it's all US, and that we're trying to be grand or charitable or something horrid.” “Hush!” said Peter. And then they heard the voice of Mr. Perks, loud and rather angry. “I don't care,” he said; “I won't stand it, and so I tell you straight.” “But,” said Mrs. Perks, “it's them children you make such a fuss about, the children from the Three Chimneys.” “I don't care,” said Perks, firmly, “not if it was a angel from Heaven. We've got on all right all these years and no favours asked. I'm not going to begin these sort of charity goings-on at my time of life, so don't you think it, Nell.” “Oh, hush!” said poor Mrs Perks; “Bert, shut your silly tongue, for goodness' sake. The all three of 'ems in the wash-house a-listening to every word you speaks.” “Then I'll give them something to listen to,” said the angry Perks; “I've spoke my mind to them afore now, and I'll do it again,” he added, and he took two strides to the wash-house door, and flung it wide open, as wide, that is, as it would go, with the tightly packed children behind it. “Come out,” said Perks, “come out and tell me what you mean by it. 'Ave I ever complained to you of being short, as you comes this charity lay over me?” “OH!” said Phyllis, “I thought you'd be so pleased; I'll never try to be kind to anyone else as long as I live. No, I won't, not never.” She burst into tears. “We didn't mean any harm,” said Peter. “It ain't what you means so much as what you does,” said Perks. “Oh, DON'T!” cried Bobbie, trying hard to be braver than Phyllis, and to find more words than Peter had done for explaining in. “We thought you'd love it. We always have things on our birthdays.” “Oh, yes,” said Perks, “your own relations; that's different.” “Oh, no,” Bobbie answered. “NOT our own relations. All the servants always gave us things at home, and us to them when it was their birthdays. And when it was mine, and Mother gave me the brooch like a buttercup, Mrs. Viney gave me two lovely glass pots, and nobody thought she was coming the charity lay over us.” “If it had been glass pots here,” said Perks, “I wouldn't ha' said so much. It's there being all this heaps and heaps of things I can't stand. No, nor won't, neither.” “But they're not all from us, ” said Peter, “only we forgot to put the labels on. They're from all sorts of people in the village.” “Who put 'em up to it, I'd like to know?” asked Perks. “Why, we did,” sniffed Phyllis. Perks sat down heavily in the elbow-chair and looked at them with what Bobbie afterwards described as withering glances of gloomy despair. “So you've been round telling the neighbours we can't make both ends meet? Well, now you've disgraced us as deep as you can in the neighbourhood, you can just take the whole bag of tricks back w'ere it come from. Very much obliged, I'm sure. I don't doubt but what you meant it kind, but I'd rather not be acquainted with you any longer if it's all the same to you.” He deliberately turned the chair round so that his back was turned to the children. The legs of the chair grated on the brick floor, and that was the only sound that broke the silence. Then suddenly Bobbie spoke. “Look here,” she said, “this is most awful.” “That's what I says,” said Perks, not turning round. “Look here,” said Bobbie, desperately, “we'll go if you like, and you needn't be friends with us any more if you don't want, but, ” “WE shall always be friends with YOU, however nasty you are to us,”  sniffed Phyllis, wildly. “Be quiet,” said Peter, in a fierce aside. “But before we go,” Bobbie went on desperately, “do let us show you the labels we wrote to put on the things.” “I don't want to see no labels,” said Perks, “except proper luggage ones in my own walk of life. Do you think I've kept respectable and outer debt on what I gets, and her having to take in washing, to be give away for a laughing-stock to all the neighbours?” “Laughing?” said Peter; “you don't know.” “You're a very hasty gentleman,” whined Phyllis; “you know you were wrong once before, about us not telling you the secret about the Russian. Do let Bobbie tell you about the labels!” “Well. Go ahead!” said Perks, grudgingly. “Well, then,” said Bobbie, fumbling miserably, yet not without hope, in her tightly stuffed pocket, “we wrote down all the things everybody said when they gave us the things, with the people's names, because Mother said we ought to be careful, because, but I wrote down what she said, and you'll see.” But Bobbie could not read the labels just at once. She had to swallow once or twice before she could begin. Mrs. Perks had been crying steadily ever since her husband had opened the wash-house door. Now she caught her breath, choked, and said:,  “Don't you upset yourself, Missy.  I  know you meant it kind if he doesn't.” “May I read the labels?” said Bobbie, crying on to the slips as she tried to sort them. “Mother's first. It says:,  “'Little Clothes for Mrs. Perks's children.' Mother said, 'I'll find some of Phyllis's things that she's grown out of if you're quite sure Mr. Perks wouldn't be offended and think it's meant for charity. I'd like to do some little thing for him, because he's so kind to you. I can't do much because we're poor ourselves.'” Bobbie paused. “That's all right,” said Perks, “your Ma's a born lady. We'll keep the little frocks, and what not, Nell.” “Then there's the perambulator and the gooseberries, and the sweets,”  said Bobbie, “they're from Mrs. Ransome. She said: 'I dare say Mr. Perks's children would like the sweets. And the perambulator was got for my Emmie's first, it didn't live but six months, and she's never had but that one. I'd like Mrs. Perks to have it. It would be a help with her fine boy. I'd have given it before if I'd been sure she'd accept of it from me.' She told me to tell you,” Bobbie added, “that it was her Emmie's little one's pram.” “I can't send that pram back, Bert,” said Mrs Perks, firmly, “and I won't. So don't you ask me, ” “I'm not a-asking anything,” said Perks, gruffly. “Then the shovel,” said Bobbie. “Mr. James made it for you himself. And he said, where is it? Oh, yes, here! He said, 'You tell Mr. Perks it's a pleasure to make a little trifle for a man as is so much respected,' and then he said he wished he could shoe your children and his own children, like they do the horses, because, well, he knew what shoe leather was.” “James is a good enough chap,” said Perks. “Then the honey,” said Bobbie, in haste, “and the boot-laces. HE said he respected a man that paid his way, and the butcher said the same. And the old turnpike woman said many was the time you'd lent her a hand with her garden when you were a lad, and things like that came home to roost, I don't know what she meant. And everybody who gave anything said they liked you, and it was a very good idea of ours; and nobody said anything about charity or anything horrid like that. And the old gentleman gave Peter a gold pound for you, and said you were a man who knew your work. And I thought you'd LOVE to know how fond people are of you, and I never was so unhappy in my life. Good-bye. I hope you'll forgive us some day, ” She could say no more, and she turned to go. “Stop,” said Perks, still with his back to them; “I take back every word I've said contrary to what you'd wish. Nell, set on the kettle.” “We'll take the things away if you're unhappy about them,” said Peter; “but I think everybody'll be most awfully disappointed, as well as us.” “I'm not unhappy about them,” said Perks; “I don't know,” he added, suddenly wheeling the chair round and showing a very odd-looking screwed-up face, “I don't know as ever I was better pleased. Not so much with the presents, though they're an A1 collection, but the kind respect of our neighbours. That's worth having, eh, Nell?” “I think it's all worth having,” said Mrs. Perks, “and you've made a most ridiculous fuss about nothing, Bert, if you ask me.” “No, I ain't,” said Perks, firmly; “if a man didn't respect hisself, no one wouldn't do it for him.” “But everyone respects you,” said Bobbie; “they all said so.” “I knew you'd like it when you really understood,” said Phyllis, brightly. “Humph! You'll stay to tea?” said Mr. Perks. Later on Peter proposed Mr. Perks's health. And Mr. Perks proposed a toast, also honoured in tea, and the toast was, “May the garland of friendship be ever green,” which was much more poetical than anyone had expected from him.                                                                    “Jolly good little kids, those,” said Mr. Perks to his wife as they went to bed. “Oh, they're all right, bless their hearts,” said his wife; “it's you that's the aggravatingest old thing that ever was. I was ashamed of you, I tell you, ” “You didn't need to be, old gal. I climbed down handsome soon as I understood it wasn't charity. But charity's what I never did abide, and won't neither.”                                                                    All sorts of people were made happy by that birthday party. Mr. Perks and Mrs. Perks and the little Perkses by all the nice things and by the kind thoughts of their neighbours; the Three Chimneys children by the success, undoubted though unexpectedly delayed, of their plan; and Mrs. Ransome every time she saw the fat Perks baby in the perambulator. Mrs. Perks made quite a round of visits to thank people for their kind birthday presents, and after each visit felt that she had a better friend than she had thought. “Yes,” said Perks, reflectively, “it's not so much what you does as what you means; that's what I say. Now if it had been charity, ” “Oh, drat charity,” said Mrs. Perks; “nobody won't offer you charity, Bert, however much you was to want it, I lay. That was just friendliness, that was.” When the clergyman called on Mrs. Perks, she told him all about it. “It WAS friendliness, wasn't it, Sir?” said she. “I think,” said the clergyman, “it was what is sometimes called loving-kindness.” So you see it was all right in the end. But if one does that sort of thing, one has to be careful to do it in the right way. For, as Mr. Perks said, when he had time to think it over, it's not so much what you do, as what you mean. Chapter X. The terrible secret. When they first went to live at Three Chimneys, the children had talked a great deal about their Father, and had asked a great many questions about him, and what he was doing and where he was and when he would come home. Mother always answered their questions as well as she could. But as the time went on they grew to speak less of him. Bobbie had felt almost from the first that for some strange miserable reason these questions hurt Mother and made her sad. And little by little the others came to have this feeling, too, though they could not have put it into words. One day, when Mother was working so hard that she could not leave off even for ten minutes, Bobbie carried up her tea to the big bare room that they called Mother's workshop. It had hardly any furniture. Just a table and a chair and a rug. But always big pots of flowers on the window-sills and on the mantelpiece. The children saw to that. And from the three long uncurtained windows the beautiful stretch of meadow and moorland, the far violet of the hills, and the unchanging changefulness of cloud and sky. “Here's your tea, Mother-love,” said Bobbie; “do drink it while it's hot.” Mother laid down her pen among the pages that were scattered all over the table, pages covered with her writing, which was almost as plain as print, and much prettier. She ran her hands into her hair, as if she were going to pull it out by handfuls. “Poor dear head,” said Bobbie, “does it ache?” “No, yes, not much,” said Mother. “Bobbie, do you think Peter and Phil are FORGETTING Father?” “NO,” said Bobbie, indignantly. “Why?” “You none of you ever speak of him now.” Bobbie stood first on one leg and then on the other. “We often talk about him when we're by ourselves,” she said. “But not to me,” said Mother. “Why?” Bobbie did not find it easy to say why. “I, you, ” she said and stopped. She went over to the window and looked out. “Bobbie, come here,” said her Mother, and Bobbie came. “Now,” said Mother, putting her arm round Bobbie and laying her ruffled head against Bobbie's shoulder, “try to tell me, dear.” Bobbie fidgeted. “Tell Mother.” “Well, then,” said Bobbie, “I thought you were so unhappy about Daddy not being here, it made you worse when I talked about him. So I stopped doing it.” “And the others?” “I don't know about the others,” said Bobbie. “I never said anything about THAT to them. But I expect they felt the same about it as me.” “Bobbie dear,” said Mother, still leaning her head against her, “I'll tell you. Besides parting from Father, he and I have had a great sorrow, oh, terrible, worse than anything you can think of, and at first it did hurt to hear you all talking of him as if everything were just the same. But it would be much more terrible if you were to forget him. That would be worse than anything.” “The trouble,” said Bobbie, in a very little voice, “I promised I would never ask you any questions, and I never have, have I? But, the trouble, it won't last always?” “No,” said Mother, “the worst will be over when Father comes home to us.” “I wish I could comfort you,” said Bobbie. “Oh, my dear, do you suppose you don't? Do you think I haven't noticed how good you've all been, not quarrelling nearly as much as you used to, and all the little kind things you do for me, the flowers, and cleaning my shoes, and tearing up to make my bed before I get time to do it myself?” Bobbie HAD sometimes wondered whether Mother noticed these things. “That's nothing,” she said, “to what, ” “I MUST get on with my work,” said Mother, giving Bobbie one last squeeze. “Don't say anything to the others.” That evening in the hour before bed-time instead of reading to the children Mother told them stories of the games she and Father used to have when they were children and lived near each other in the country, tales of the adventures of Father with Mother's brothers when they were all boys together. Very funny stories they were, and the children laughed as they listened. “Uncle Edward died before he was grown up, didn't he?” said Phyllis, as Mother lighted the bedroom candles. “Yes, dear,” said Mother, “you would have loved him. He was such a brave boy, and so adventurous. Always in mischief, and yet friends with everybody in spite of it. And your Uncle Reggie's in Ceylon, yes, and Father's away, too. But I think they'd all like to think we'd enjoyed talking about the things they used to do. Don't you think so?” “Not Uncle Edward,” said Phyllis, in a shocked tone; “he's in Heaven.” “You don't suppose he's forgotten us and all the old times, because God has taken him, any more than I forget him. Oh, no, he remembers. He's only away for a little time. We shall see him some day.” “And Uncle Reggie, and Father, too?” said Peter. “Yes,” said Mother. “Uncle Reggie and Father, too. Good night, my darlings.” “Good night,” said everyone. Bobbie hugged her mother more closely even than usual, and whispered in her ear, “Oh, I do love you so, Mummy, I do, I do, ” When Bobbie came to think it all over, she tried not to wonder what the great trouble was. But she could not always help it. Father was not dead, like poor Uncle Edward, Mother had said so. And he was not ill, or Mother would have been with him. Being poor wasn't the trouble. Bobbie knew it was something nearer the heart than money could be. “I mustn't try to think what it is,” she told herself; “no, I mustn't. I AM glad Mother noticed about us not quarrelling so much. We'll keep that up.” And alas, that very afternoon she and Peter had what Peter called a first-class shindy. They had not been a week at Three Chimneys before they had asked Mother to let them have a piece of garden each for their very own, and she had agreed, and the south border under the peach trees had been divided into three pieces and they were allowed to plant whatever they liked there. Phyllis had planted mignonette and nasturtium and Virginia Stock in hers. The seeds came up, and though they looked just like weeds, Phyllis believed that they would bear flowers some day. The Virginia Stock justified her faith quite soon, and her garden was gay with a band of bright little flowers, pink and white and red and mauve. “I can't weed for fear I pull up the wrong things,” she used to say comfortably; “it saves such a lot of work.” Peter sowed vegetable seeds in his, carrots and onions and turnips. The seed was given to him by the farmer who lived in the nice black-and-white, wood-and-plaster house just beyond the bridge. He kept turkeys and guinea fowls, and was a most amiable man. But Peter's vegetables never had much of a chance, because he liked to use the earth of his garden for digging canals, and making forts and earthworks for his toy soldiers. And the seeds of vegetables rarely come to much in a soil that is constantly disturbed for the purposes of war and irrigation. Bobbie planted rose-bushes in her garden, but all the little new leaves of the rose-bushes shrivelled and withered, perhaps because she moved them from the other part of the garden in May, which is not at all the right time of year for moving roses. But she would not own that they were dead, and hoped on against hope, until the day when Perks came up to see the garden, and told her quite plainly that all her roses were as dead as doornails. “Only good for bonfires, Miss,” he said. “You just dig 'em up and burn 'em, and I'll give you some nice fresh roots outer my garden; pansies, and stocks, and sweet willies, and forget-me-nots. I'll bring 'em along to-morrow if you get the ground ready.” So next day she set to work, and that happened to be the day when Mother had praised her and the others about not quarrelling. She moved the rose-bushes and carried them to the other end of the garden, where the rubbish heap was that they meant to make a bonfire of when Guy Fawkes' Day came. Meanwhile Peter had decided to flatten out all his forts and earthworks, with a view to making a model of the railway-tunnel, cutting, embankment, canal, aqueduct, bridges, and all. So when Bobbie came back from her last thorny journey with the dead rose-bushes, he had got the rake and was using it busily. “ I  was using the rake,” said Bobbie. “Well, I'm using it now,” said Peter. “But I had it first,” said Bobbie. “Then it's my turn now,” said Peter. And that was how the quarrel began. “You're always being disagreeable about nothing,” said Peter, after some heated argument. “I had the rake first,” said Bobbie, flushed and defiant, holding on to its handle. “Don't, I tell you I said this morning I meant to have it. Didn't I, Phil?” Phyllis said she didn't want to be mixed up in their rows. And instantly, of course, she was. “If you remember, you ought to say.” “Of course she doesn't remember, but she might say so.” “I wish I'd had a brother instead of two whiny little kiddy sisters,”  said Peter. This was always recognised as indicating the high-water mark of Peter's rage. Bobbie made the reply she always made to it. “I can't think why little boys were ever invented,” and just as she said it she looked up, and saw the three long windows of Mother's workshop flashing in the red rays of the sun. The sight brought back those words of praise:,  “You don't quarrel like you used to do.” “OH!” cried Bobbie, just as if she had been hit, or had caught her finger in a door, or had felt the hideous sharp beginnings of toothache. “What's the matter?” said Phyllis. Bobbie wanted to say: “Don't let's quarrel. Mother hates it so,” but though she tried hard, she couldn't. Peter was looking too disagreeable and insulting. “Take the horrid rake, then,” was the best she could manage. And she suddenly let go her hold on the handle. Peter had been holding on to it too firmly and pullingly, and now that the pull the other way was suddenly stopped, he staggered and fell over backward, the teeth of the rake between his feet. “Serve you right,” said Bobbie, before she could stop herself. Peter lay still for half a moment, long enough to frighten Bobbie a little. Then he frightened her a little more, for he sat up, screamed once, turned rather pale, and then lay back and began to shriek, faintly but steadily. It sounded exactly like a pig being killed a quarter of a mile off. Mother put her head out of the window, and it wasn't half a minute after that she was in the garden kneeling by the side of Peter, who never for an instant ceased to squeal. “What happened, Bobbie?” Mother asked. “It was the rake,” said Phyllis. “Peter was pulling at it, so was Bobbie, and she let go and he went over.” “Stop that noise, Peter,” said Mother. “Come. Stop at once.” Peter used up what breath he had left in a last squeal and stopped. “Now,” said Mother, “are you hurt?” “If he was really hurt, he wouldn't make such a fuss,” said Bobbie, still trembling with fury; “he's not a coward!” “I think my foot's broken off, that's all,” said Peter, huffily, and sat up. Then he turned quite white. Mother put her arm round him. “He IS hurt,” she said; “he's fainted. Here, Bobbie, sit down and take his head on your lap.” Then Mother undid Peter's boots. As she took the right one off, something dripped from his foot on to the ground. It was red blood. And when the stocking came off there were three red wounds in Peter's foot and ankle, where the teeth of the rake had bitten him, and his foot was covered with red smears. “Run for water, a basinful,” said Mother, and Phyllis ran. She upset most of the water out of the basin in her haste, and had to fetch more in a jug. Peter did not open his eyes again till Mother had tied her handkerchief round his foot, and she and Bobbie had carried him in and laid him on the brown wooden settle in the dining-room. By this time Phyllis was halfway to the Doctor's. Mother sat by Peter and bathed his foot and talked to him, and Bobbie went out and got tea ready, and put on the kettle. “It's all I can do,” she told herself. “Oh, suppose Peter should die, or be a helpless cripple for life, or have to walk with crutches, or wear a boot with a sole like a log of wood!” She stood by the back door reflecting on these gloomy possibilities, her eyes fixed on the water-butt. “I wish I'd never been born,” she said, and she said it out loud. “Why, lawk a mercy, what's that for?” asked a voice, and Perks stood before her with a wooden trug basket full of green-leaved things and soft, loose earth. “Oh, it's you,” she said. “Peter's hurt his foot with a rake, three great gaping wounds, like soldiers get. And it was partly my fault.” “That it wasn't, I'll go bail,” said Perks. “Doctor seen him?” “Phyllis has gone for the Doctor.” “He'll be all right; you see if he isn't,” said Perks. “Why, my father's second cousin had a hay-fork run into him, right into his inside, and he was right as ever in a few weeks, all except his being a bit weak in the head afterwards, and they did say that it was along of his getting a touch of the sun in the hay-field, and not the fork at all. I remember him well. A kind-'earted chap, but soft, as you might say.” Bobbie tried to let herself be cheered by this heartening reminiscence. “Well,” said Perks, “you won't want to be bothered with gardening just this minute, I dare say. You show me where your garden is, and I'll pop the bits of stuff in for you. And I'll hang about, if I may make so free, to see the Doctor as he comes out and hear what he says. You cheer up, Missie. I lay a pound he ain't hurt, not to speak of.” But he was. The Doctor came and looked at the foot and bandaged it beautifully, and said that Peter must not put it to the ground for at least a week. “He won't be lame, or have to wear crutches or a lump on his foot, will he?” whispered Bobbie, breathlessly, at the door. “My aunt! No!” said Dr. Forrest; “he'll be as nimble as ever on his pins in a fortnight. Don't you worry, little Mother Goose.” It was when Mother had gone to the gate with the Doctor to take his last instructions and Phyllis was filling the kettle for tea, that Peter and Bobbie found themselves alone. “He says you won't be lame or anything,” said Bobbie. “Oh, course I shan't, silly,” said Peter, very much relieved all the same. “Oh, Peter, I AM so sorry,” said Bobbie, after a pause. “That's all right,” said Peter, gruffly. “It was ALL my fault,” said Bobbie. “Rot,” said Peter. “If we hadn't quarrelled, it wouldn't have happened. I knew it was wrong to quarrel. I wanted to say so, but somehow I couldn't.” “Don't drivel,” said Peter. “I shouldn't have stopped if you HAD said it. Not likely. And besides, us rowing hadn't anything to do with it. I might have caught my foot in the hoe, or taken off my fingers in the chaff-cutting machine or blown my nose off with fireworks. It would have been hurt just the same whether we'd been rowing or not.” “But I knew it was wrong to quarrel,” said Bobbie, in tears, “and now you're hurt and, ” “Now look here,” said Peter, firmly, “you just dry up. If you're not careful, you'll turn into a beastly little Sunday-school prig, so I tell you.” “I don't mean to be a prig. But it's so hard not to be when you're really trying to be good.” (The Gentle Reader may perhaps have suffered from this difficulty.) “Not it,” said Peter; “it's a jolly good thing it wasn't you was hurt. I'm glad it was ME. There! If it had been you, you'd have been lying on the sofa looking like a suffering angel and being the light of the anxious household and all that. And I couldn't have stood it.” “No, I shouldn't,” said Bobbie. “Yes, you would,” said Peter. “I tell you I shouldn't.” “I tell you you would.” “Oh, children,” said Mother's voice at the door. “Quarrelling again? Already?” “We aren't quarrelling, not really,” said Peter. “I wish you wouldn't think it's rows every time we don't agree!” When Mother had gone out again, Bobbie broke out:,  “Peter, I AM sorry you're hurt. But you ARE a beast to say I'm a prig.” “Well,” said Peter unexpectedly, “perhaps I am. You did say I wasn't a coward, even when you were in such a wax. The only thing is, don't you be a prig, that's all. You keep your eyes open and if you feel priggishness coming on just stop in time. See?” “Yes,” said Bobbie, “I see.” “Then let's call it Pax,” said Peter, magnanimously: “bury the hatchet in the fathoms of the past. Shake hands on it. I say, Bobbie, old chap, I am tired.” He was tired for many days after that, and the settle seemed hard and uncomfortable in spite of all the pillows and bolsters and soft folded rugs. It was terrible not to be able to go out. They moved the settle to the window, and from there Peter could see the smoke of the trains winding along the valley. But he could not see the trains. At first Bobbie found it quite hard to be as nice to him as she wanted to be, for fear he should think her priggish. But that soon wore off, and both she and Phyllis were, as he observed, jolly good sorts. Mother sat with him when his sisters were out. And the words, “he's not a coward,” made Peter determined not to make any fuss about the pain in his foot, though it was rather bad, especially at night. Praise helps people very much, sometimes. There were visitors, too. Mrs. Perks came up to ask how he was, and so did the Station Master, and several of the village people. But the time went slowly, slowly. “I do wish there was something to read,” said Peter. “I've read all our books fifty times over.” “I'll go to the Doctor's,” said Phyllis; “he's sure to have some.” “Only about how to be ill, and about people's nasty insides, I expect,”  said Peter. “Perks has a whole heap of Magazines that came out of trains when people are tired of them,” said Bobbie. “I'll run down and ask him.” So the girls went their two ways. Bobbie found Perks busy cleaning lamps. “And how's the young gent?” said he. “Better, thanks,” said Bobbie, “but he's most frightfully bored. I came to ask if you'd got any Magazines you could lend him.” “There, now,” said Perks, regretfully, rubbing his ear with a black and oily lump of cotton waste, “why didn't I think of that, now? I was trying to think of something as 'ud amuse him only this morning, and I couldn't think of anything better than a guinea-pig. And a young chap I know's going to fetch that over for him this tea-time.” “How lovely! A real live guinea! He will be pleased. But he'd like the Magazines as well.” “That's just it,” said Perks. “I've just sent the pick of 'em to Snigson's boy, him what's just getting over the pewmonia. But I've lots of illustrated papers left.” He turned to the pile of papers in the corner and took up a heap six inches thick. “There!” he said. “I'll just slip a bit of string and a bit of paper round 'em.” He pulled an old newspaper from the pile and spread it on the table, and made a neat parcel of it. “There,” said he, “there's lots of pictures, and if he likes to mess 'em about with his paint-box, or coloured chalks or what not, why, let him.  I  don't want 'em.” “You're a dear,” said Bobbie, took the parcel, and started. The papers were heavy, and when she had to wait at the level-crossing while a train went by, she rested the parcel on the top of the gate. And idly she looked at the printing on the paper that the parcel was wrapped in. Suddenly she clutched the parcel tighter and bent her head over it. It seemed like some horrible dream. She read on, the bottom of the column was torn off, she could read no farther. She never remembered how she got home. But she went on tiptoe to her room and locked the door. Then she undid the parcel and read that printed column again, sitting on the edge of her bed, her hands and feet icy cold and her face burning. When she had read all there was, she drew a long, uneven breath. “So now I know,” she said. What she had read was headed, 'End of the Trial. Verdict. Sentence.' The name of the man who had been tried was the name of her Father. The verdict was 'Guilty.' And the sentence was 'Five years' Penal Servitude.' “Oh, Daddy,” she whispered, crushing the paper hard, “it's not true, I don't believe it. You never did it! Never, never, never!” There was a hammering on the door. “What is it?” said Bobbie. “It's me,” said the voice of Phyllis; “tea's ready, and a boy's brought Peter a guinea-pig. Come along down.” And Bobbie had to. Chapter XI. The hound in the red jersey. Bobbie knew the secret now. A sheet of old newspaper wrapped round a parcel, just a little chance like that, had given the secret to her. And she had to go down to tea and pretend that there was nothing the matter. The pretence was bravely made, but it wasn't very successful. For when she came in, everyone looked up from tea and saw her pink-lidded eyes and her pale face with red tear-blotches on it. “My darling,” cried Mother, jumping up from the tea-tray, “whatever IS the matter?” “My head aches, rather,” said Bobbie. And indeed it did. “Has anything gone wrong?” Mother asked. “I'm all right, really,” said Bobbie, and she telegraphed to her Mother from her swollen eyes this brief, imploring message, “NOT before the others!” Tea was not a cheerful meal. Peter was so distressed by the obvious fact that something horrid had happened to Bobbie that he limited his speech to repeating, “More bread and butter, please,” at startlingly short intervals. Phyllis stroked her sister's hand under the table to express sympathy, and knocked her cup over as she did it. Fetching a cloth and wiping up the spilt milk helped Bobbie a little. But she thought that tea would never end. Yet at last it did end, as all things do at last, and when Mother took out the tray, Bobbie followed her. “She's gone to own up,” said Phyllis to Peter; “I wonder what she's done.” “Broken something, I suppose,” said Peter, “but she needn't be so silly over it. Mother never rows for accidents. Listen! Yes, they're going upstairs. She's taking Mother up to show her, the water-jug with storks on it, I expect it is.” Bobbie, in the kitchen, had caught hold of Mother's hand as she set down the tea-things. “What is it?” Mother asked. But Bobbie only said, “Come upstairs, come up where nobody can hear us.” When she had got Mother alone in her room she locked the door and then stood quite still, and quite without words. All through tea she had been thinking of what to say; she had decided that “I know all,” or “All is known to me,” or “The terrible secret is a secret no longer,” would be the proper thing. But now that she and her Mother and that awful sheet of newspaper were alone in the room together, she found that she could say nothing. Suddenly she went to Mother and put her arms round her and began to cry again. And still she could find no words, only, “Oh, Mammy, oh, Mammy, oh, Mammy,” over and over again. Mother held her very close and waited. Suddenly Bobbie broke away from her and went to her bed. From under her mattress she pulled out the paper she had hidden there, and held it out, pointing to her Father's name with a finger that shook. “Oh, Bobbie,” Mother cried, when one little quick look had shown her what it was, “you don't BELIEVE it? You don't believe Daddy did it?” “NO,” Bobbie almost shouted. She had stopped crying. “That's all right,” said Mother. “It's not true. And they've shut him up in prison, but he's done nothing wrong. He's good and noble and honourable, and he belongs to us. We have to think of that, and be proud of him, and wait.” Again Bobbie clung to her Mother, and again only one word came to her, but now that word was “Daddy,” and “Oh, Daddy, oh, Daddy, oh, Daddy!”  again and again. “Why didn't you tell me, Mammy?” she asked presently. “Are you going to tell the others?” Mother asked. “No.” “Why?” “Because, ” “Exactly,” said Mother; “so you understand why I didn't tell you. We two must help each other to be brave.” “Yes,” said Bobbie; “Mother, will it make you more unhappy if you tell me all about it? I want to understand.” So then, sitting cuddled up close to her Mother, Bobbie heard “all about it.” She heard how those men, who had asked to see Father on that remembered last night when the Engine was being mended, had come to arrest him, charging him with selling State secrets to the Russians, with being, in fact, a spy and a traitor. She heard about the trial, and about the evidence, letters, found in Father's desk at the office, letters that convinced the jury that Father was guilty. “Oh, how could they look at him and believe it!” cried Bobbie; “and how could ANY one do such a thing!” “SOMEONE did it,” said Mother, “and all the evidence was against Father. Those letters, ” “Yes. How did the letters get into his desk?” “Someone put them there. And the person who put them there was the person who was really guilty.” “HE must be feeling pretty awful all this time,” said Bobbie, thoughtfully. “I don't believe he had any feelings,” Mother said hotly; “he couldn't have done a thing like that if he had.” “Perhaps he just shoved the letters into the desk to hide them when he thought he was going to be found out. Why don't you tell the lawyers, or someone, that it must have been that person? There wasn't anyone that would have hurt Father on purpose, was there?” “I don't know, I don't know. The man under him who got Daddy's place when he, when the awful thing happened, he was always jealous of your Father because Daddy was so clever and everyone thought such a lot of him. And Daddy never quite trusted that man.” “Couldn't we explain all that to someone?” “Nobody will listen,” said Mother, very bitterly, “nobody at all. Do you suppose I've not tried everything? No, my dearest, there's nothing to be done. All we can do, you and I and Daddy, is to be brave, and patient, and, ” she spoke very softly, “to pray, Bobbie, dear.” “Mother, you've got very thin,” said Bobbie, abruptly. “A little, perhaps.” “And oh,” said Bobbie, “I do think you're the bravest person in the world as well as the nicest!” “We won't talk of all this any more, will we, dear?” said Mother; “we must bear it and be brave. And, darling, try not to think of it. Try to be cheerful, and to amuse yourself and the others. It's much easier for me if you can be a little bit happy and enjoy things. Wash your poor little round face, and let's go out into the garden for a bit.” The other two were very gentle and kind to Bobbie. And they did not ask her what was the matter. This was Peter's idea, and he had drilled Phyllis, who would have asked a hundred questions if she had been left to herself. A week later Bobbie managed to get away alone. And once more she wrote a letter. And once more it was to the old gentleman. “My dear Friend,” she said, “you see what is in this paper. It is not true. Father never did it. Mother says someone put the papers in Father's desk, and she says the man under him that got Father's place afterwards was jealous of Father, and Father suspected him a long time. But nobody listens to a word she says, but you are so good and clever, and you found out about the Russian gentleman's wife directly. Can't you find out who did the treason because he wasn't Father upon my honour; he is an Englishman and uncapable to do such things, and then they would let Father out of prison. It is dreadful, and Mother is getting so thin. She told us once to pray for all prisoners and captives. I see now. Oh, do help me, there is only just Mother and me know, and we can't do anything. Peter and Phil don't know. I'll pray for you twice every day as long as I live if you'll only try, just try to find out. Think if it was YOUR Daddy, what you would feel. Oh, do, do, DO help me. With love “I remain Your affectionately little friend “Roberta. P.S. Mother would send her kind regards if she knew I am writing, but it is no use telling her I am, in case you can't do anything. But I know you will. Bobbie with best love.” She cut the account of her Father's trial out of the newspaper with Mother's big cutting-out scissors, and put it in the envelope with her letter. Then she took it down to the station, going out the back way and round by the road, so that the others should not see her and offer to come with her, and she gave the letter to the Station Master to give to the old gentleman next morning. “Where HAVE you been?” shouted Peter, from the top of the yard wall where he and Phyllis were. “To the station, of course,” said Bobbie; “give us a hand, Pete.” She set her foot on the lock of the yard door. Peter reached down a hand. “What on earth?” she asked as she reached the wall-top, for Phyllis and Peter were very muddy. A lump of wet clay lay between them on the wall, they had each a slip of slate in a very dirty hand, and behind Peter, out of the reach of accidents, were several strange rounded objects rather like very fat sausages, hollow, but closed up at one end. “It's nests,” said Peter, “swallows' nests. We're going to dry them in the oven and hang them up with string under the eaves of the coach-house.” “Yes,” said Phyllis; “and then we're going to save up all the wool and hair we can get, and in the spring we'll line them, and then how pleased the swallows will be!” “I've often thought people don't do nearly enough for dumb animals,”  said Peter with an air of virtue. “I do think people might have thought of making nests for poor little swallows before this.” “Oh,” said Bobbie, vaguely, “if everybody thought of everything, there'd be nothing left for anybody else to think about.” “Look at the nests, aren't they pretty?” said Phyllis, reaching across Peter to grasp a nest. “Look out, Phil, you goat,” said her brother. But it was too late; her strong little fingers had crushed the nest. “There now,” said Peter. “Never mind,” said Bobbie. “It IS one of my own,” said Phyllis, “so you needn't jaw, Peter. Yes, we've put our initial names on the ones we've done, so that the swallows will know who they've got to be so grateful to and fond of.” “Swallows can't read, silly,” said Peter. “Silly yourself,” retorted Phyllis; “how do you know?” “Who thought of making the nests, anyhow?” shouted Peter. “I did,” screamed Phyllis. “Nya,” rejoined Peter, “you only thought of making hay ones and sticking them in the ivy for the sparrows, and they'd have been sopping LONG before egg-laying time. It was me said clay and swallows.” “I don't care what you said.” “Look,” said Bobbie, “I've made the nest all right again. Give me the bit of stick to mark your initial name on it. But how can you? Your letter and Peter's are the same. P. for Peter, P. for Phyllis.” “I put F. for Phyllis,” said the child of that name. “That's how it sounds. The swallows wouldn't spell Phyllis with a P., I'm certain-sure.” “They can't spell at all,” Peter was still insisting. “Then why do you see them always on Christmas cards and valentines with letters round their necks? How would they know where to go if they couldn't read?” “That's only in pictures. You never saw one really with letters round its neck.” “Well, I have a pigeon, then; at least Daddy told me they did. Only it was under their wings and not round their necks, but it comes to the same thing, and, ” “I say,” interrupted Bobbie, “there's to be a paperchase to-morrow.” “Who?” Peter asked. “Grammar School. Perks thinks the hare will go along by the line at first. We might go along the cutting. You can see a long way from there.” The paperchase was found to be a more amusing subject of conversation than the reading powers of swallows. Bobbie had hoped it might be. And next morning Mother let them take their lunch and go out for the day to see the paperchase. “If we go to the cutting,” said Peter, “we shall see the workmen, even if we miss the paperchase.” Of course it had taken some time to get the line clear from the rocks and earth and trees that had fallen on it when the great landslip happened. That was the occasion, you will remember, when the three children saved the train from being wrecked by waving six little red-flannel-petticoat flags. It is always interesting to watch people working, especially when they work with such interesting things as spades and picks and shovels and planks and barrows, when they have cindery red fires in iron pots with round holes in them, and red lamps hanging near the works at night. Of course the children were never out at night; but once, at dusk, when Peter had got out of his bedroom skylight on to the roof, he had seen the red lamp shining far away at the edge of the cutting. The children had often been down to watch the work, and this day the interest of picks and spades, and barrows being wheeled along planks, completely put the paperchase out of their heads, so that they quite jumped when a voice just behind them panted, “Let me pass, please.” It was the hare, a big-boned, loose-limbed boy, with dark hair lying flat on a very damp forehead. The bag of torn paper under his arm was fastened across one shoulder by a strap. The children stood back. The hare ran along the line, and the workmen leaned on their picks to watch him. He ran on steadily and disappeared into the mouth of the tunnel. “That's against the by-laws,” said the foreman. “Why worry?” said the oldest workman; “live and let live's what I always say. Ain't you never been young yourself, Mr. Bates?” “I ought to report him,” said the foreman. “Why spoil sport's what I always say.” “Passengers are forbidden to cross the line on any pretence,” murmured the foreman, doubtfully. “He ain't no passenger,” said one of the workmen. “Nor 'e ain't crossed the line, not where we could see 'im do it,” said another. “Nor yet 'e ain't made no pretences,” said a third. “And,” said the oldest workman, “'e's outer sight now. What the eye don't see the 'art needn't take no notice of's what I always say.” And now, following the track of the hare by the little white blots of scattered paper, came the hounds. There were thirty of them, and they all came down the steep, ladder-like steps by ones and twos and threes and sixes and sevens. Bobbie and Phyllis and Peter counted them as they passed. The foremost ones hesitated a moment at the foot of the ladder, then their eyes caught the gleam of scattered whiteness along the line and they turned towards the tunnel, and, by ones and twos and threes and sixes and sevens, disappeared in the dark mouth of it. The last one, in a red jersey, seemed to be extinguished by the darkness like a candle that is blown out. “They don't know what they're in for,” said the foreman; “it isn't so easy running in the dark. The tunnel takes two or three turns.” “They'll take a long time to get through, you think?” Peter asked. “An hour or more, I shouldn't wonder.” “Then let's cut across the top and see them come out at the other end,”  said Peter; “we shall get there long before they do.” The counsel seemed good, and they went. They climbed the steep steps from which they had picked the wild cherry blossom for the grave of the little wild rabbit, and reaching the top of the cutting, set their faces towards the hill through which the tunnel was cut. It was stiff work. “It's like Alps,” said Bobbie, breathlessly. “Or Andes,” said Peter. “It's like Himmy what's its names?” gasped Phyllis. “Mount Everlasting. Do let's stop.” “Stick to it,” panted Peter; “you'll get your second wind in a minute.” Phyllis consented to stick to it, and on they went, running when the turf was smooth and the slope easy, climbing over stones, helping themselves up rocks by the branches of trees, creeping through narrow openings between tree trunks and rocks, and so on and on, up and up, till at last they stood on the very top of the hill where they had so often wished to be. “Halt!” cried Peter, and threw himself flat on the grass. For the very top of the hill was a smooth, turfed table-land, dotted with mossy rocks and little mountain-ash trees. The girls also threw themselves down flat. “Plenty of time,” Peter panted; “the rest's all down hill.” When they were rested enough to sit up and look round them, Bobbie cried:,  “Oh, look!” “What at?” said Phyllis. “The view,” said Bobbie. “I hate views,” said Phyllis, “don't you, Peter?” “Let's get on,” said Peter. “But this isn't like a view they take you to in carriages when you're at the seaside, all sea and sand and bare hills. It's like the 'coloured counties' in one of Mother's poetry books.” “It's not so dusty,” said Peter; “look at the Aqueduct straddling slap across the valley like a giant centipede, and then the towns sticking their church spires up out of the trees like pens out of an inkstand.  I  think it's more like      “There could he see the banners       Of twelve fair cities shine.” “I love it,” said Bobbie; “it's worth the climb.” “The paperchase is worth the climb,” said Phyllis, “if we don't lose it. Let's get on. It's all down hill now.” “ I  said that ten minutes ago,” said Peter. “Well, I'VE said it now,” said Phyllis; “come on.” “Loads of time,” said Peter. And there was. For when they had got down to a level with the top of the tunnel's mouth, they were a couple of hundred yards out of their reckoning and had to creep along the face of the hill, there was no sign of the hare or the hounds. “They've gone long ago, of course,” said Phyllis, as they leaned on the brick parapet above the tunnel. “I don't think so,” said Bobbie, “but even if they had, it's ripping here, and we shall see the trains come out of the tunnel like dragons out of lairs. We've never seen that from the top side before.” “No more we have,” said Phyllis, partially appeased. It was really a most exciting place to be in. The top of the tunnel seemed ever so much farther from the line than they had expected, and it was like being on a bridge, but a bridge overgrown with bushes and creepers and grass and wild-flowers. “I KNOW the paperchase has gone long ago,” said Phyllis every two minutes, and she hardly knew whether she was pleased or disappointed when Peter, leaning over the parapet, suddenly cried:,  “Look out. Here he comes!” They all leaned over the sun-warmed brick wall in time to see the hare, going very slowly, come out from the shadow of the tunnel. “There, now,” said Peter, “what did I tell you? Now for the hounds!” Very soon came the hounds, by ones and twos and threes and sixes and sevens, and they also were going slowly and seemed very tired. Two or three who lagged far behind came out long after the others. “There,” said Bobbie, “that's all, now what shall we do?” “Go along into the tulgy wood over there and have lunch,” said Phyllis; “we can see them for miles from up here.” “Not yet,” said Peter. “That's not the last. There's the one in the red jersey to come yet. Let's see the last of them come out.” But though they waited and waited and waited, the boy in the red jersey did not appear. “Oh, let's have lunch,” said Phyllis; “I've got a pain in my front with being so hungry. You must have missed seeing the red-jerseyed one when he came out with the others, ” But Bobbie and Peter agreed that he had not come out with the others. “Let's get down to the tunnel mouth,” said Peter; “then perhaps we shall see him coming along from the inside. I expect he felt spun-chuck, and rested in one of the manholes. You stay up here and watch, Bob, and when I signal from below, you come down. We might miss seeing him on the way down, with all these trees.” So the others climbed down and Bobbie waited till they signalled to her from the line below. And then she, too, scrambled down the roundabout slippery path among roots and moss till she stepped out between two dogwood trees and joined the others on the line. And still there was no sign of the hound with the red jersey. “Oh, do, DO let's have something to eat,” wailed Phyllis. “I shall die if you don't, and then you'll be sorry.” “Give her the sandwiches, for goodness' sake, and stop her silly mouth,”  said Peter, not quite unkindly. “Look here,” he added, turning to Bobbie, “perhaps we'd better have one each, too. We may need all our strength. Not more than one, though. There's no time.” “What?” asked Bobbie, her mouth already full, for she was just as hungry as Phyllis. “Don't you see,” replied Peter, impressively, “that red-jerseyed hound has had an accident, that's what it is. Perhaps even as we speak he's lying with his head on the metals, an unresisting prey to any passing express, ” “Oh, don't try to talk like a book,” cried Bobbie, bolting what was left of her sandwich; “come on. Phil, keep close behind me, and if a train comes, stand flat against the tunnel wall and hold your petticoats close to you.” “Give me one more sandwich,” pleaded Phyllis, “and I will.” “I'm going first,” said Peter; “it was my idea,” and he went. Of course you know what going into a tunnel is like? The engine gives a scream and then suddenly the noise of the running, rattling train changes and grows different and much louder. Grown-up people pull up the windows and hold them by the strap. The railway carriage suddenly grows like night, with lamps, of course, unless you are in a slow local train, in which case lamps are not always provided. Then by and by the darkness outside the carriage window is touched by puffs of cloudy whiteness, then you see a blue light on the walls of the tunnel, then the sound of the moving train changes once more, and you are out in the good open air again, and grown-ups let the straps go. The windows, all dim with the yellow breath of the tunnel, rattle down into their places, and you see once more the dip and catch of the telegraph wires beside the line, and the straight-cut hawthorn hedges with the tiny baby trees growing up out of them every thirty yards. All this, of course, is what a tunnel means when you are in a train. But everything is quite different when you walk into a tunnel on your own feet, and tread on shifting, sliding stones and gravel on a path that curves downwards from the shining metals to the wall. Then you see slimy, oozy trickles of water running down the inside of the tunnel, and you notice that the bricks are not red or brown, as they are at the tunnel's mouth, but dull, sticky, sickly green. Your voice, when you speak, is quite changed from what it was out in the sunshine, and it is a long time before the tunnel is quite dark. It was not yet quite dark in the tunnel when Phyllis caught at Bobbie's skirt, ripping out half a yard of gathers, but no one noticed this at the time. “I want to go back,” she said, “I don't like it. It'll be pitch dark in a minute. I WON'T go on in the dark. I don't care what you say, I WON'T.” “Don't be a silly cuckoo,” said Peter; “I've got a candle end and matches, and, what's that?” “That” was a low, humming sound on the railway line, a trembling of the wires beside it, a buzzing, humming sound that grew louder and louder as they listened. “It's a train,” said Bobbie. “Which line?” “Let me go back,” cried Phyllis, struggling to get away from the hand by which Bobbie held her. “Don't be a coward,” said Bobbie; “it's quite safe. Stand back.” “Come on,” shouted Peter, who was a few yards ahead. “Quick! Manhole!” The roar of the advancing train was now louder than the noise you hear when your head is under water in the bath and both taps are running, and you are kicking with your heels against the bath's tin sides. But Peter had shouted for all he was worth, and Bobbie heard him. She dragged Phyllis along to the manhole. Phyllis, of course, stumbled over the wires and grazed both her legs. But they dragged her in, and all three stood in the dark, damp, arched recess while the train roared louder and louder. It seemed as if it would deafen them. And, in the distance, they could see its eyes of fire growing bigger and brighter every instant. “It IS a dragon, I always knew it was, it takes its own shape in here, in the dark,” shouted Phyllis. But nobody heard her. You see the train was shouting, too, and its voice was bigger than hers. And now, with a rush and a roar and a rattle and a long dazzling flash of lighted carriage windows, a smell of smoke, and blast of hot air, the train hurtled by, clanging and jangling and echoing in the vaulted roof of the tunnel. Phyllis and Bobbie clung to each other. Even Peter caught hold of Bobbie's arm, “in case she should be frightened,” as he explained afterwards. And now, slowly and gradually, the tail-lights grew smaller and smaller, and so did the noise, till with one last WHIZ the train got itself out of the tunnel, and silence settled again on its damp walls and dripping roof. “OH!” said the children, all together in a whisper. Peter was lighting the candle end with a hand that trembled. “Come on,” he said; but he had to clear his throat before he could speak in his natural voice. “Oh,” said Phyllis, “if the red-jerseyed one was in the way of the train!” “We've got to go and see,” said Peter. “Couldn't we go and send someone from the station?” said Phyllis. “Would you rather wait here for us?” asked Bobbie, severely, and of course that settled the question. So the three went on into the deeper darkness of the tunnel. Peter led, holding his candle end high to light the way. The grease ran down his fingers, and some of it right up his sleeve. He found a long streak from wrist to elbow when he went to bed that night. It was not more than a hundred and fifty yards from the spot where they had stood while the train went by that Peter stood still, shouted “Hullo,” and then went on much quicker than before. When the others caught him up, he stopped. And he stopped within a yard of what they had come into the tunnel to look for. Phyllis saw a gleam of red, and shut her eyes tight. There, by the curved, pebbly down line, was the red-jerseyed hound. His back was against the wall, his arms hung limply by his sides, and his eyes were shut. “Was the red, blood? Is he all killed?” asked Phyllis, screwing her eyelids more tightly together. “Killed? Nonsense!” said Peter. “There's nothing red about him except his jersey. He's only fainted. What on earth are we to do?” “Can we move him?” asked Bobbie. “I don't know; he's a big chap.” “Suppose we bathe his forehead with water. No, I know we haven't any, but milk's just as wet. There's a whole bottle.” “Yes,” said Peter, “and they rub people's hands, I believe.” “They burn feathers, I know,” said Phyllis. “What's the good of saying that when we haven't any feathers?” “As it happens,” said Phyllis, in a tone of exasperated triumph, “I've got a shuttlecock in my pocket. So there!” And now Peter rubbed the hands of the red-jerseyed one. Bobbie burned the feathers of the shuttlecock one by one under his nose, Phyllis splashed warmish milk on his forehead, and all three kept on saying as fast and as earnestly as they could:,  “Oh, look up, speak to me! For my sake, speak!” Chapter XII. What Bobbie brought home. “Oh, look up! Speak to me! For MY sake, speak!” The children said the words over and over again to the unconscious hound in a red jersey, who sat with closed eyes and pale face against the side of the tunnel. “Wet his ears with milk,” said Bobbie. “I know they do it to people that faint, with eau-de-Cologne. But I expect milk's just as good.” So they wetted his ears, and some of the milk ran down his neck under the red jersey. It was very dark in the tunnel. The candle end Peter had carried, and which now burned on a flat stone, gave hardly any light at all. “Oh, DO look up,” said Phyllis. “For MY sake! I believe he's dead.” “For MY sake,” repeated Bobbie. “No, he isn't.” “For ANY sake,” said Peter; “come out of it.” And he shook the sufferer by the arm. And then the boy in the red jersey sighed, and opened his eyes, and shut them again and said in a very small voice, “Chuck it.” “Oh, he's NOT dead,” said Phyllis. “I KNEW he wasn't,” and she began to cry. “What's up? I'm all right,” said the boy. “Drink this,” said Peter, firmly, thrusting the nose of the milk bottle into the boy's mouth. The boy struggled, and some of the milk was upset before he could get his mouth free to say:,  “What is it?” “It's milk,” said Peter. “Fear not, you are in the hands of friends. Phil, you stop bleating this minute.” “Do drink it,” said Bobbie, gently; “it'll do you good.” So he drank. And the three stood by without speaking to him. “Let him be a minute,” Peter whispered; “he'll be all right as soon as the milk begins to run like fire through his veins.” He was. “I'm better now,” he announced. “I remember all about it.” He tried to move, but the movement ended in a groan. “Bother! I believe I've broken my leg,” he said. “Did you tumble down?” asked Phyllis, sniffing. “Of course not, I'm not a kiddie,” said the boy, indignantly; “it was one of those beastly wires tripped me up, and when I tried to get up again I couldn't stand, so I sat down. Gee whillikins! it does hurt, though. How did YOU get here?” “We saw you all go into the tunnel and then we went across the hill to see you all come out. And the others did, all but you, and you didn't. So we are a rescue party,” said Peter, with pride. “You've got some pluck, I will say,” remarked the boy. “Oh, that's nothing,” said Peter, with modesty. “Do you think you could walk if we helped you?” “I could try,” said the boy. He did try. But he could only stand on one foot; the other dragged in a very nasty way. “Here, let me sit down. I feel like dying,” said the boy. “Let go of me, let go, quick, ” He lay down and closed his eyes. The others looked at each other by the dim light of the little candle. “What on earth!” said Peter. “Look here,” said Bobbie, quickly, “you must go and get help. Go to the nearest house.” “Yes, that's the only thing,” said Peter. “Come on.” “If you take his feet and Phil and I take his head, we could carry him to the manhole.” They did it. It was perhaps as well for the sufferer that he had fainted again. “Now,” said Bobbie, “I'll stay with him. You take the longest bit of candle, and, oh, be quick, for this bit won't burn long.” “I don't think Mother would like me leaving you,” said Peter, doubtfully. “Let me stay, and you and Phil go.” “No, no,” said Bobbie, “you and Phil go, and lend me your knife. I'll try to get his boot off before he wakes up again.” “I hope it's all right what we're doing,” said Peter. “Of course it's right,” said Bobbie, impatiently. “What else WOULD you do? Leave him here all alone because it's dark? Nonsense. Hurry up, that's all.” So they hurried up. Bobbie watched their dark figures and the little light of the little candle with an odd feeling of having come to the end of everything. She knew now, she thought, what nuns who were bricked up alive in convent walls felt like. Suddenly she gave herself a little shake. “Don't be a silly little girl,” she said. She was always very angry when anyone else called her a little girl, even if the adjective that went first was not “silly” but “nice” or “good” or “clever.” And it was only when she was very angry with herself that she allowed Roberta to use that expression to Bobbie. She fixed the little candle end on a broken brick near the red-jerseyed boy's feet. Then she opened Peter's knife. It was always hard to manage, a halfpenny was generally needed to get it open at all. This time Bobbie somehow got it open with her thumbnail. She broke the nail, and it hurt horribly. Then she cut the boy's bootlace, and got the boot off. She tried to pull off his stocking, but his leg was dreadfully swollen, and it did not seem to be the proper shape. So she cut the stocking down, very slowly and carefully. It was a brown, knitted stocking, and she wondered who had knitted it, and whether it was the boy's mother, and whether she was feeling anxious about him, and how she would feel when he was brought home with his leg broken. When Bobbie had got the stocking off and saw the poor leg, she felt as though the tunnel was growing darker, and the ground felt unsteady, and nothing seemed quite real. “SILLY little girl!” said Roberta to Bobbie, and felt better. “The poor leg,” she told herself; “it ought to have a cushion, ah!” She remembered the day when she and Phyllis had torn up their red flannel petticoats to make danger signals to stop the train and prevent an accident. Her flannel petticoat to-day was white, but it would be quite as soft as a red one. She took it off. “Oh, what useful things flannel petticoats are!” she said; “the man who invented them ought to have a statue directed to him.” And she said it aloud, because it seemed that any voice, even her own, would be a comfort in that darkness. “WHAT ought to be directed? Who to?” asked the boy, suddenly and very feebly. “Oh,” said Bobbie, “now you're better! Hold your teeth and don't let it hurt too much. Now!” She had folded the petticoat, and lifting his leg laid it on the cushion of folded flannel. “Don't faint again, PLEASE don't,” said Bobbie, as he groaned. She hastily wetted her handkerchief with milk and spread it over the poor leg. “Oh, that hurts,” cried the boy, shrinking. “Oh, no, it doesn't, it's nice, really.” “What's your name?” said Bobbie. “Jim.” “Mine's Bobbie.” “But you're a girl, aren't you?” “Yes, my long name's Roberta.” “I say, Bobbie.” “Yes?” “Wasn't there some more of you just now?” “Yes, Peter and Phil, that's my brother and sister. They've gone to get someone to carry you out.” “What rum names. All boys'.” “Yes, I wish I was a boy, don't you?” “I think you're all right as you are.” “I didn't mean that, I meant don't you wish YOU were a boy, but of course you are without wishing.” “You're just as brave as a boy. Why didn't you go with the others?” “Somebody had to stay with you,” said Bobbie. “Tell you what, Bobbie,” said Jim, “you're a brick. Shake.” He reached out a red-jerseyed arm and Bobbie squeezed his hand. “I won't shake it,” she explained, “because it would shake YOU, and that would shake your poor leg, and that would hurt. Have you got a hanky?” “I don't expect I have.” He felt in his pocket. “Yes, I have. What for?” She took it and wetted it with milk and put it on his forehead. “That's jolly,” he said; “what is it?” “Milk,” said Bobbie. “We haven't any water, ” “You're a jolly good little nurse,” said Jim. “I do it for Mother sometimes,” said Bobbie, “not milk, of course, but scent, or vinegar and water. I say, I must put the candle out now, because there mayn't be enough of the other one to get you out by.” “By George,” said he, “you think of everything.” Bobbie blew. Out went the candle. You have no idea how black-velvety the darkness was. “I say, Bobbie,” said a voice through the blackness, “aren't you afraid of the dark?” “Not, not very, that is, ” “Let's hold hands,” said the boy, and it was really rather good of him, because he was like most boys of his age and hated all material tokens of affection, such as kissing and holding of hands. He called all such things “pawings,” and detested them. The darkness was more bearable to Bobbie now that her hand was held in the large rough hand of the red-jerseyed sufferer; and he, holding her little smooth hot paw, was surprised to find that he did not mind it so much as he expected. She tried to talk, to amuse him, and “take his mind off” his sufferings, but it is very difficult to go on talking in the dark, and presently they found themselves in a silence, only broken now and then by a,  “You all right, Bobbie?” or an,  “I'm afraid it's hurting you most awfully, Jim. I AM so sorry.” And it was very cold.                                                                    Peter and Phyllis tramped down the long way of the tunnel towards daylight, the candle-grease dripping over Peter's fingers. There were no accidents unless you count Phyllis's catching her frock on a wire, and tearing a long, jagged slit in it, and tripping over her bootlace when it came undone, or going down on her hands and knees, all four of which were grazed. “There's no end to this tunnel,” said Phyllis, and indeed it did seem very very long. “Stick to it,” said Peter; “everything has an end, and you get to it if you only keep all on.” Which is quite true, if you come to think of it, and a useful thing to remember in seasons of trouble, such as measles, arithmetic, impositions, and those times when you are in disgrace, and feel as though no one would ever love you again, and you could never, never again, love anybody. “Hurray,” said Peter, suddenly, “there's the end of the tunnel, looks just like a pin-hole in a bit of black paper, doesn't it?” The pin-hole got larger, blue lights lay along the sides of the tunnel. The children could see the gravel way that lay in front of them; the air grew warmer and sweeter. Another twenty steps and they were out in the good glad sunshine with the green trees on both sides. Phyllis drew a long breath. “I'll never go into a tunnel again as long as ever I live,” said she, “not if there are twenty hundred thousand millions hounds inside with red jerseys and their legs broken.” “Don't be a silly cuckoo,” said Peter, as usual. “You'd HAVE to.” “I think it was very brave and good of me,” said Phyllis. “Not it,” said Peter; “you didn't go because you were brave, but because Bobbie and I aren't skunks. Now where's the nearest house, I wonder? You can't see anything here for the trees.” “There's a roof over there,” said Phyllis, pointing down the line. “That's the signal-box,” said Peter, “and you know you're not allowed to speak to signalmen on duty. It's wrong.” “I'm not near so afraid of doing wrong as I was of going into that tunnel,” said Phyllis. “Come on,” and she started to run along the line. So Peter ran, too. It was very hot in the sunshine, and both children were hot and breathless by the time they stopped, and bending their heads back to look up at the open windows of the signal-box, shouted “Hi!” as loud as their breathless state allowed. But no one answered. The signal-box stood quiet as an empty nursery, and the handrail of its steps was hot to the hands of the children as they climbed softly up. They peeped in at the open door. The signalman was sitting on a chair tilted back against the wall. His head leaned sideways, and his mouth was open. He was fast asleep. “My hat!” cried Peter; “wake up!” And he cried it in a terrible voice, for he knew that if a signalman sleeps on duty, he risks losing his situation, let alone all the other dreadful risks to trains which expect him to tell them when it is safe for them to go their ways. The signalman never moved. Then Peter sprang to him and shook him. And slowly, yawning and stretching, the man awoke. But the moment he WAS awake he leapt to his feet, put his hands to his head “like a mad maniac,” as Phyllis said afterwards, and shouted:,  “Oh, my heavens, what's o'clock?” “Twelve thirteen,” said Peter, and indeed it was by the white-faced, round-faced clock on the wall of the signal-box. The man looked at the clock, sprang to the levers, and wrenched them this way and that. An electric bell tingled, the wires and cranks creaked, and the man threw himself into a chair. He was very pale, and the sweat stood on his forehead “like large dewdrops on a white cabbage,” as Phyllis remarked later. He was trembling, too; the children could see his big hairy hands shake from side to side, “with quite extra-sized trembles,” to use the subsequent words of Peter. He drew long breaths. Then suddenly he cried, “Thank God, thank God you come in when you did, oh, thank God!” and his shoulders began to heave and his face grew red again, and he hid it in those large hairy hands of his. “Oh, don't cry, don't,” said Phyllis, “it's all right now,” and she patted him on one big, broad shoulder, while Peter conscientiously thumped the other. But the signalman seemed quite broken down, and the children had to pat him and thump him for quite a long time before he found his handkerchief, a red one with mauve and white horseshoes on it, and mopped his face and spoke. During this patting and thumping interval a train thundered by. “I'm downright shamed, that I am,” were the words of the big signalman when he had stopped crying; “snivelling like a kid.” Then suddenly he seemed to get cross. “And what was you doing up here, anyway?” he said; “you know it ain't allowed.” “Yes,” said Phyllis, “we knew it was wrong, but I wasn't afraid of doing wrong, and so it turned out right. You aren't sorry we came.” “Lor' love you, if you hadn't 'a' come, ” he stopped and then went on. “It's a disgrace, so it is, sleeping on duty. If it was to come to be known, even as it is, when no harm's come of it.” “It won't come to be known,” said Peter; “we aren't sneaks. All the same, you oughtn't to sleep on duty, it's dangerous.” “Tell me something I don't know,” said the man, “but I can't help it. I know'd well enough just how it 'ud be. But I couldn't get off. They couldn't get no one to take on my duty. I tell you I ain't had ten minutes' sleep this last five days. My little chap's ill, pewmonia, the Doctor says, and there's no one but me and 'is little sister to do for him. That's where it is. The gell must 'ave her sleep. Dangerous? Yes, I believe you. Now go and split on me if you like.” “Of course we won't,” said Peter, indignantly, but Phyllis ignored the whole of the signalman's speech, except the first six words. “You asked us,” she said, “to tell you something you don't know. Well, I will. There's a boy in the tunnel over there with a red jersey and his leg broken.” “What did he want to go into the blooming tunnel for, then?” said the man. “Don't you be so cross,” said Phyllis, kindly. “WE haven't done anything wrong except coming and waking you up, and that was right, as it happens.” Then Peter told how the boy came to be in the tunnel. “Well,” said the man, “I don't see as I can do anything. I can't leave the box.” “You might tell us where to go after someone who isn't in a box, though,” said Phyllis. “There's Brigden's farm over yonder, where you see the smoke a-coming up through the trees,” said the man, more and more grumpy, as Phyllis noticed. “Well, good-bye, then,” said Peter. But the man said, “Wait a minute.” He put his hand in his pocket and brought out some money, a lot of pennies and one or two shillings and sixpences and half-a-crown. He picked out two shillings and held them out. “Here,” he said. “I'll give you this to hold your tongues about what's taken place to-day.” There was a short, unpleasant pause. Then:,  “You ARE a nasty man, though, aren't you?” said Phyllis. Peter took a step forward and knocked the man's hand up, so that the shillings leapt out of it and rolled on the floor. “If anything COULD make me sneak, THAT would!” he said. “Come, Phil,”  and marched out of the signal-box with flaming cheeks. Phyllis hesitated. Then she took the hand, still held out stupidly, that the shillings had been in. “I forgive you,” she said, “even if Peter doesn't. You're not in your proper senses, or you'd never have done that. I know want of sleep sends people mad. Mother told me. I hope your little boy will soon be better, and, ” “Come on, Phil,” cried Peter, eagerly. “I give you my sacred honour-word we'll never tell anyone. Kiss and be friends,” said Phyllis, feeling how noble it was of her to try to make up a quarrel in which she was not to blame. The signalman stooped and kissed her. “I do believe I'm a bit off my head, Sissy,” he said. “Now run along home to Mother. I didn't mean to put you about, there.” So Phil left the hot signal-box and followed Peter across the fields to the farm. When the farm men, led by Peter and Phyllis and carrying a hurdle covered with horse-cloths, reached the manhole in the tunnel, Bobbie was fast asleep and so was Jim. Worn out with the pain, the Doctor said afterwards. “Where does he live?” the bailiff from the farm asked, when Jim had been lifted on to the hurdle. “In Northumberland,” answered Bobbie. “I'm at school at Maidbridge,” said Jim. “I suppose I've got to get back there, somehow.” “Seems to me the Doctor ought to have a look in first,” said the bailiff. “Oh, bring him up to our house,” said Bobbie. “It's only a little way by the road. I'm sure Mother would say we ought to.” “Will your Ma like you bringing home strangers with broken legs?” “She took the poor Russian home herself,” said Bobbie. “I know she'd say we ought.” “All right,” said the bailiff, “you ought to know what your Ma 'ud like. I wouldn't take it upon me to fetch him up to our place without I asked the Missus first, and they call me the Master, too.” “Are you sure your Mother won't mind?” whispered Jim. “Certain,” said Bobbie. “Then we're to take him up to Three Chimneys?” said the bailiff. “Of course,” said Peter. “Then my lad shall nip up to Doctor's on his bike, and tell him to come down there. Now, lads, lift him quiet and steady. One, two, three!”                                                                    Thus it happened that Mother, writing away for dear life at a story about a Duchess, a designing villain, a secret passage, and a missing will, dropped her pen as her work-room door burst open, and turned to see Bobbie hatless and red with running. “Oh, Mother,” she cried, “do come down. We found a hound in a red jersey in the tunnel, and he's broken his leg and they're bringing him home.” “They ought to take him to the vet,” said Mother, with a worried frown; “I really CAN'T have a lame dog here.” “He's not a dog, really, he's a boy,” said Bobbie, between laughing and choking. “Then he ought to be taken home to his mother.” “His mother's dead,” said Bobbie, “and his father's in Northumberland. Oh, Mother, you will be nice to him? I told him I was sure you'd want us to bring him home. You always want to help everybody.” Mother smiled, but she sighed, too. It is nice that your children should believe you willing to open house and heart to any and every one who needs help. But it is rather embarrassing sometimes, too, when they act on their belief. “Oh, well,” said Mother, “we must make the best of it.” When Jim was carried in, dreadfully white and with set lips whose red had faded to a horrid bluey violet colour, Mother said:,  “I am glad you brought him here. Now, Jim, let's get you comfortable in bed before the Doctor comes!” And Jim, looking at her kind eyes, felt a little, warm, comforting flush of new courage. “It'll hurt rather, won't it?” he said. “I don't mean to be a coward. You won't think I'm a coward if I faint again, will you? I really and truly don't do it on purpose. And I do hate to give you all this trouble.” “Don't you worry,” said Mother; “it's you that have the trouble, you poor dear, not us.” And she kissed him just as if he had been Peter. “We love to have you here, don't we, Bobbie?” “Yes,” said Bobbie, and she saw by her Mother's face how right she had been to bring home the wounded hound in the red jersey. Chapter XIII. The hound's grandfather. Mother did not get back to her writing all that day, for the red-jerseyed hound whom the children had brought to Three Chimneys had to be put to bed. And then the Doctor came, and hurt him most horribly. Mother was with him all through it, and that made it a little better than it would have been, but “bad was the best,” as Mrs. Viney said. The children sat in the parlour downstairs and heard the sound of the Doctor's boots going backwards and forwards over the bedroom floor. And once or twice there was a groan. “It's horrible,” said Bobbie. “Oh, I wish Dr. Forrest would make haste. Oh, poor Jim!” “It IS horrible,” said Peter, “but it's very exciting. I wish Doctors weren't so stuck-up about who they'll have in the room when they're doing things. I should most awfully like to see a leg set. I believe the bones crunch like anything.” “Don't!” said the two girls at once. “Rubbish!” said Peter. “How are you going to be Red Cross Nurses, like you were talking of coming home, if you can't even stand hearing me say about bones crunching? You'd have to HEAR them crunch on the field of battle, and be steeped in gore up to the elbows as likely as not, and, ” “Stop it!” cried Bobbie, with a white face; “you don't know how funny you're making me feel.” “Me, too,” said Phyllis, whose face was pink. “Cowards!” said Peter. “I'm not,” said Bobbie. “I helped Mother with your rake-wounded foot, and so did Phil, you know we did.” “Well, then!” said Peter. “Now look here. It would be a jolly good thing for you if I were to talk to you every day for half an hour about broken bones and people's insides, so as to get you used to it.” A chair was moved above. “Listen,” said Peter, “that's the bone crunching.” “I do wish you wouldn't,” said Phyllis. “Bobbie doesn't like it.” “I'll tell you what they do,” said Peter. I can't think what made him so horrid. Perhaps it was because he had been so very nice and kind all the earlier part of the day, and now he had to have a change. This is called reaction. One notices it now and then in oneself. Sometimes when one has been extra good for a longer time than usual, one is suddenly attacked by a violent fit of not being good at all. “I'll tell you what they do,”  said Peter; “they strap the broken man down so that he can't resist or interfere with their doctorish designs, and then someone holds his head, and someone holds his leg, the broken one, and pulls it till the bones fit in, with a crunch, mind you! Then they strap it up and, let's play at bone-setting!” “Oh, no!” said Phyllis. But Bobbie said suddenly: “All right, LET'S! I'll be the doctor, and Phil can be the nurse. You can be the broken boner; we can get at your legs more easily, because you don't wear petticoats.” “I'll get the splints and bandages,” said Peter; “you get the couch of suffering ready.” The ropes that had tied up the boxes that had come from home were all in a wooden packing-case in the cellar. When Peter brought in a trailing tangle of them, and two boards for splints, Phyllis was excitedly giggling. “Now, then,” he said, and lay down on the settle, groaning most grievously. “Not so loud!” said Bobbie, beginning to wind the rope round him and the settle. “You pull, Phil.” “Not so tight,” moaned Peter. “You'll break my other leg.” Bobbie worked on in silence, winding more and more rope round him. “That's enough,” said Peter. “I can't move at all. Oh, my poor leg!” He groaned again. “SURE you can't move?” asked Bobbie, in a rather strange tone. “Quite sure,” replied Peter. “Shall we play it's bleeding freely or not?” he asked cheerfully. “YOU can play what you like,” said Bobbie, sternly, folding her arms and looking down at him where he lay all wound round and round with cord. “Phil and I are going away. And we shan't untie you till you promise never, never to talk to us about blood and wounds unless we say you may. Come, Phil!” “You beast!” said Peter, writhing. “I'll never promise, never. I'll yell, and Mother will come.” “Do,” said Bobbie, “and tell her why we tied you up! Come on, Phil. No, I'm not a beast, Peter. But you wouldn't stop when we asked you and, ” “Yah,” said Peter, “it wasn't even your own idea. You got it out of Stalky!” Bobbie and Phil, retiring in silent dignity, were met at the door by the Doctor. He came in rubbing his hands and looking pleased with himself. “Well,” he said, “THAT job's done. It's a nice clean fracture, and it'll go on all right, I've no doubt. Plucky young chap, too, hullo! what's all this?” His eye had fallen on Peter who lay mousy-still in his bonds on the settle. “Playing at prisoners, eh?” he said; but his eyebrows had gone up a little. Somehow he had not thought that Bobbie would be playing while in the room above someone was having a broken bone set. “Oh, no!” said Bobbie, “not at PRISONERS. We were playing at setting bones. Peter's the broken boner, and I was the doctor.” The Doctor frowned. “Then I must say,” he said, and he said it rather sternly, “that's it's a very heartless game. Haven't you enough imagination even to faintly picture what's been going on upstairs? That poor chap, with the drops of sweat on his forehead, and biting his lips so as not to cry out, and every touch on his leg agony and, ” “YOU ought to be tied up,” said Phyllis; “you're as bad as, ” “Hush,” said Bobbie; “I'm sorry, but we weren't heartless, really.” “I was, I suppose,” said Peter, crossly. “All right, Bobbie, don't you go on being noble and screening me, because I jolly well won't have it. It was only that I kept on talking about blood and wounds. I wanted to train them for Red Cross Nurses. And I wouldn't stop when they asked me.” “Well?” said Dr. Forrest, sitting down. “Well, then I said, 'Let's play at setting bones.' It was all rot. I knew Bobbie wouldn't. I only said it to tease her. And then when she said 'yes,' of course I had to go through with it. And they tied me up. They got it out of Stalky. And I think it's a beastly shame.” He managed to writhe over and hide his face against the wooden back of the settle. “I didn't think that anyone would know but us,” said Bobbie, indignantly answering Peter's unspoken reproach. “I never thought of your coming in. And hearing about blood and wounds does really make me feel most awfully funny. It was only a joke our tying him up. Let me untie you, Pete.” “I don't care if you never untie me,” said Peter; “and if that's your idea of a joke, ” “If I were you,” said the Doctor, though really he did not quite know what to say, “I should be untied before your Mother comes down. You don't want to worry her just now, do you?” “I don't promise anything about not saying about wounds, mind,” said Peter, in very surly tones, as Bobbie and Phyllis began to untie the knots. “I'm very sorry, Pete,” Bobbie whispered, leaning close to him as she fumbled with the big knot under the settle; “but if you only knew how sick you made me feel.” “You've made ME feel pretty sick, I can tell you,” Peter rejoined. Then he shook off the loose cords, and stood up. “I looked in,” said Dr. Forrest, “to see if one of you would come along to the surgery. There are some things that your Mother will want at once, and I've given my man a day off to go and see the circus; will you come, Peter?” Peter went without a word or a look to his sisters. The two walked in silence up to the gate that led from the Three Chimneys field to the road. Then Peter said:,  “Let me carry your bag. I say, it is heavy, what's in it?” “Oh, knives and lancets and different instruments for hurting people. And the ether bottle. I had to give him ether, you know, the agony was so intense.” Peter was silent. “Tell me all about how you found that chap,” said Dr. Forrest. Peter told. And then Dr. Forrest told him stories of brave rescues; he was a most interesting man to talk to, as Peter had often remarked. Then in the surgery Peter had a better chance than he had ever had of examining the Doctor's balance, and his microscope, and his scales and measuring glasses. When all the things were ready that Peter was to take back, the Doctor said suddenly:,  “You'll excuse my shoving my oar in, won't you? But I should like to say something to you.” “Now for a rowing,” thought Peter, who had been wondering how it was that he had escaped one. “Something scientific,” added the Doctor. “Yes,” said Peter, fiddling with the fossil ammonite that the Doctor used for a paper-weight. “Well then, you see. Boys and girls are only little men and women. And WE are much harder and hardier than they are, ” (Peter liked the “we.”  Perhaps the Doctor had known he would.), “and much stronger, and things that hurt THEM don't hurt US. You know you mustn't hit a girl, ” “I should think not, indeed,” muttered Peter, indignantly. “Not even if she's your own sister. That's because girls are so much softer and weaker than we are; they have to be, you know,” he added, “because if they weren't, it wouldn't be nice for the babies. And that's why all the animals are so good to the mother animals. They never fight them, you know.” “I know,” said Peter, interested; “two buck rabbits will fight all day if you let them, but they won't hurt a doe.” “No; and quite wild beasts, lions and elephants, they're immensely gentle with the female beasts. And we've got to be, too.” “I see,” said Peter. “And their hearts are soft, too,” the Doctor went on, “and things that we shouldn't think anything of hurt them dreadfully. So that a man has to be very careful, not only of his fists, but of his words. They're awfully brave, you know,” he went on. “Think of Bobbie waiting alone in the tunnel with that poor chap. It's an odd thing, the softer and more easily hurt a woman is the better she can screw herself up to do what HAS to be done. I've seen some brave women, your Mother's one,” he ended abruptly. “Yes,” said Peter. “Well, that's all. Excuse my mentioning it. But nobody knows everything without being told. And you see what I mean, don't you?” “Yes,” said Peter. “I'm sorry. There!” “Of course you are! People always are, directly they understand. Everyone ought to be taught these scientific facts. So long!” They shook hands heartily. When Peter came home, his sisters looked at him doubtfully. “It's Pax,” said Peter, dumping down the basket on the table. “Dr. Forrest has been talking scientific to me. No, it's no use my telling you what he said; you wouldn't understand. But it all comes to you girls being poor, soft, weak, frightened things like rabbits, so us men have just got to put up with them. He said you were female beasts. Shall I take this up to Mother, or will you?” “I know what BOYS are,” said Phyllis, with flaming cheeks; “they're just the nastiest, rudest, ” “They're very brave,” said Bobbie, “sometimes.” “Ah, you mean the chap upstairs? I see. Go ahead, Phil, I shall put up with you whatever you say because you're a poor, weak, frightened, soft, ” “Not if I pull your hair you won't,” said Phyllis, springing at him. “He said 'Pax,'” said Bobbie, pulling her away. “Don't you see,” she whispered as Peter picked up the basket and stalked out with it, “he's sorry, really, only he won't say so? Let's say we're sorry.” “It's so goody goody,” said Phyllis, doubtfully; “he said we were female beasts, and soft and frightened, ” “Then let's show him we're not frightened of him thinking us goody goody,” said Bobbie; “and we're not any more beasts than he is.” And when Peter came back, still with his chin in the air, Bobbie said:,  “We're sorry we tied you up, Pete.” “I thought you would be,” said Peter, very stiff and superior. This was hard to bear. But,  “Well, so we are,” said Bobbie. “Now let honour be satisfied on both sides.” “I did call it Pax,” said Peter, in an injured tone. “Then let it BE Pax,” said Bobbie. “Come on, Phil, let's get the tea. Pete, you might lay the cloth.” “I say,” said Phyllis, when peace was really restored, which was not till they were washing up the cups after tea, “Dr. Forrest didn't REALLY say we were female beasts, did he?” “Yes,” said Peter, firmly, “but I think he meant we men were wild beasts, too.” “How funny of him!” said Phyllis, breaking a cup.                                                                    “May I come in, Mother?” Peter was at the door of Mother's writing room, where Mother sat at her table with two candles in front of her. Their flames looked orange and violet against the clear grey blue of the sky where already a few stars were twinkling. “Yes, dear,” said Mother, absently, “anything wrong?” She wrote a few more words and then laid down her pen and began to fold up what she had written. “I was just writing to Jim's grandfather. He lives near here, you know.” “Yes, you said so at tea. That's what I want to say. Must you write to him, Mother? Couldn't we keep Jim, and not say anything to his people till he's well? It would be such a surprise for them.” “Well, yes,” said Mother, laughing, “I think it would.” “You see,” Peter went on, “of course the girls are all right and all that, I'm not saying anything against THEM. But I should like it if I had another chap to talk to sometimes.” “Yes,” said Mother, “I know it's dull for you, dear. But I can't help it. Next year perhaps I can send you to school, you'd like that, wouldn't you?” “I do miss the other chaps, rather,” Peter confessed; “but if Jim could stay after his leg was well, we could have awful larks.” “I've no doubt of it,” said Mother. “Well, perhaps he could, but you know, dear, we're not rich. I can't afford to get him everything he'll want. And he must have a nurse.” “Can't you nurse him, Mother? You do nurse people so beautifully.” “That's a pretty compliment, Pete, but I can't do nursing and my writing as well. That's the worst of it.” “Then you MUST send the letter to his grandfather?” “Of course, and to his schoolmaster, too. We telegraphed to them both, but I must write as well. They'll be most dreadfully anxious.” “I say, Mother, why can't his grandfather pay for a nurse?” Peter suggested. “That would be ripping. I expect the old boy's rolling in money. Grandfathers in books always are.” “Well, this one isn't in a book,” said Mother, “so we mustn't expect him to roll much.” “I say,” said Peter, musingly, “wouldn't it be jolly if we all WERE in a book, and you were writing it? Then you could make all sorts of jolly things happen, and make Jim's legs get well at once and be all right to-morrow, and Father come home soon and, ” “Do you miss your Father very much?” Mother asked, rather coldly, Peter thought. “Awfully,” said Peter, briefly. Mother was enveloping and addressing the second letter. “You see,” Peter went on slowly, “you see, it's not only him BEING Father, but now he's away there's no other man in the house but me, that's why I want Jim to stay so frightfully much. Wouldn't you like to be writing that book with us all in it, Mother, and make Daddy come home soon?” Peter's Mother put her arm round him suddenly, and hugged him in silence for a minute. Then she said:,  “Don't you think it's rather nice to think that we're in a book that God's writing? If I were writing the book, I might make mistakes. But God knows how to make the story end just right, in the way that's best for us.” “Do you really believe that, Mother?” Peter asked quietly. “Yes,” she said, “I do believe it, almost always, except when I'm so sad that I can't believe anything. But even when I can't believe it, I know it's true, and I try to believe. You don't know how I try, Peter. Now take the letters to the post, and don't let's be sad any more. Courage, courage! That's the finest of all the virtues! I dare say Jim will be here for two or three weeks yet.” For what was left of the evening Peter was so angelic that Bobbie feared he was going to be ill. She was quite relieved in the morning to find him plaiting Phyllis's hair on to the back of her chair in quite his old manner. It was soon after breakfast that a knock came at the door. The children were hard at work cleaning the brass candlesticks in honour of Jim's visit. “That'll be the Doctor,” said Mother; “I'll go. Shut the kitchen door, you're not fit to be seen.” But it wasn't the Doctor. They knew that by the voice and by the sound of the boots that went upstairs. They did not recognise the sound of the boots, but everyone was certain that they had heard the voice before. There was a longish interval. The boots and the voice did not come down again. “Who can it possibly be?” they kept on asking themselves and each other. “Perhaps,” said Peter at last, “Dr. Forrest has been attacked by highwaymen and left for dead, and this is the man he's telegraphed for to take his place. Mrs. Viney said he had a local tenant to do his work when he went for a holiday, didn't you, Mrs. Viney?” “I did so, my dear,” said Mrs. Viney from the back kitchen. “He's fallen down in a fit, more likely,” said Phyllis, “all human aid despaired of. And this is his man come to break the news to Mother.” “Nonsense!” said Peter, briskly; “Mother wouldn't have taken the man up into Jim's bedroom. Why should she? Listen, the door's opening. Now they'll come down. I'll open the door a crack.” He did. “It's not listening,” he replied indignantly to Bobbie's scandalised remarks; “nobody in their senses would talk secrets on the stairs. And Mother can't have secrets to talk with Dr. Forrest's stable-man, and you said it was him.” “Bobbie,” called Mother's voice. They opened the kitchen door, and Mother leaned over the stair railing. “Jim's grandfather has come,” she said; “wash your hands and faces and then you can see him. He wants to see you!” The bedroom door shut again. “There now!” said Peter; “fancy us not even thinking of that! Let's have some hot water, Mrs. Viney. I'm as black as your hat.” The three were indeed dirty, for the stuff you clean brass candlesticks with is very far from cleaning to the cleaner. They were still busy with soap and flannel when they heard the boots and the voice come down the stairs and go into the dining-room. And when they were clean, though still damp, because it takes such a long time to dry your hands properly, and they were very impatient to see the grandfather, they filed into the dining-room. Mother was sitting in the window-seat, and in the leather-covered armchair that Father always used to sit in at the other house sat,       THEIR OWN OLD GENTLEMAN! “Well, I never did,” said Peter, even before he said, “How do you do?”  He was, as he explained afterwards, too surprised even to remember that there was such a thing as politeness, much less to practise it. “It's our own old gentleman!” said Phyllis. “Oh, it's you!” said Bobbie. And then they remembered themselves and their manners and said, “How do you do?” very nicely. “This is Jim's grandfather, Mr. , , ” said Mother, naming the old gentleman's name. “How splendid!” said Peter; “that's just exactly like a book, isn't it, Mother?” “It is, rather,” said Mother, smiling; “things do happen in real life that are rather like books, sometimes.” “I am so awfully glad it IS you,” said Phyllis; “when you think of the tons of old gentlemen there are in the world, it might have been almost anyone.” “I say, though,” said Peter, “you're not going to take Jim away, though, are you?” “Not at present,” said the old gentleman. “Your Mother has most kindly consented to let him stay here. I thought of sending a nurse, but your Mother is good enough to say that she will nurse him herself.” “But what about her writing?” said Peter, before anyone could stop him. “There won't be anything for him to eat if Mother doesn't write.” “That's all right,” said Mother, hastily. The old gentleman looked very kindly at Mother. “I see,” he said, “you trust your children, and confide in them.” “Of course,” said Mother. “Then I may tell them of our little arrangement,” he said. “Your Mother, my dears, has consented to give up writing for a little while and to become a Matron of my Hospital.” “Oh!” said Phyllis, blankly; “and shall we have to go away from Three Chimneys and the Railway and everything?” “No, no, darling,” said Mother, hurriedly. “The Hospital is called Three Chimneys Hospital,” said the old gentleman, “and my unlucky Jim's the only patient, and I hope he'll continue to be so. Your Mother will be Matron, and there'll be a hospital staff of a housemaid and a cook, till Jim's well.” “And then will Mother go on writing again?” asked Peter. “We shall see,” said the old gentleman, with a slight, swift glance at Bobbie; “perhaps something nice may happen and she won't have to.” “I love my writing,” said Mother, very quickly. “I know,” said the old gentleman; “don't be afraid that I'm going to try to interfere. But one never knows. Very wonderful and beautiful things do happen, don't they? And we live most of our lives in the hope of them. I may come again to see the boy?” “Surely,” said Mother, “and I don't know how to thank you for making it possible for me to nurse him. Dear boy!” “He kept calling Mother, Mother, in the night,” said Phyllis. “I woke up twice and heard him.” “He didn't mean me,” said Mother, in a low voice to the old gentleman; “that's why I wanted so much to keep him.” The old gentleman rose. “I'm so glad,” said Peter, “that you're going to keep him, Mother.” “Take care of your Mother, my dears,” said the old gentleman. “She's a woman in a million.” “Yes, isn't she?” whispered Bobbie. “God bless her,” said the old gentleman, taking both Mother's hands, “God bless her! Ay, and she shall be blessed. Dear me, where's my hat? Will Bobbie come with me to the gate?” At the gate he stopped and said:,  “You're a good child, my dear, I got your letter. But it wasn't needed. When I read about your Father's case in the papers at the time, I had my doubts. And ever since I've known who you were, I've been trying to find out things. I haven't done very much yet. But I have hopes, my dear, I have hopes.” “Oh!” said Bobbie, choking a little. “Yes, I may say great hopes. But keep your secret a little longer. Wouldn't do to upset your Mother with a false hope, would it?” “Oh, but it isn't false!” said Bobbie; “I KNOW you can do it. I knew you could when I wrote. It isn't a false hope, is it?” “No,” he said, “I don't think it's a false hope, or I wouldn't have told you. And I think you deserve to be told that there IS a hope.” “And you don't think Father did it, do you? Oh, say you don't think he did.” “My dear,” he said, “I'm perfectly CERTAIN he didn't.” If it was a false hope, it was none the less a very radiant one that lay warm at Bobbie's heart, and through the days that followed lighted her little face as a Japanese lantern is lighted by the candle within. Chapter XIV. The End. Life at the Three Chimneys was never quite the same again after the old gentleman came to see his grandson. Although they now knew his name, the children never spoke of him by it, at any rate, when they were by themselves. To them he was always the old gentleman, and I think he had better be the old gentleman to us, too. It wouldn't make him seem any more real to you, would it, if I were to tell you that his name was Snooks or Jenkins (which it wasn't)?, and, after all, I must be allowed to keep one secret. It's the only one; I have told you everything else, except what I am going to tell you in this chapter, which is the last. At least, of course, I haven't told you EVERYTHING. If I were to do that, the book would never come to an end, and that would be a pity, wouldn't it? Well, as I was saying, life at Three Chimneys was never quite the same again. The cook and the housemaid were very nice (I don't mind telling you their names, they were Clara and Ethelwyn), but they told Mother they did not seem to want Mrs. Viney, and that she was an old muddler. So Mrs. Viney came only two days a week to do washing and ironing. Then Clara and Ethelwyn said they could do the work all right if they weren't interfered with, and that meant that the children no longer got the tea and cleared it away and washed up the tea-things and dusted the rooms. This would have left quite a blank in their lives, although they had often pretended to themselves and to each other that they hated housework. But now that Mother had no writing and no housework to do, she had time for lessons. And lessons the children had to do. However nice the person who is teaching you may be, lessons are lessons all the world over, and at their best are worse fun than peeling potatoes or lighting a fire. On the other hand, if Mother now had time for lessons, she also had time for play, and to make up little rhymes for the children as she used to do. She had not had much time for rhymes since she came to Three Chimneys. There was one very odd thing about these lessons. Whatever the children were doing, they always wanted to be doing something else. When Peter was doing his Latin, he thought it would be nice to be learning History like Bobbie. Bobbie would have preferred Arithmetic, which was what Phyllis happened to be doing, and Phyllis of course thought Latin much the most interesting kind of lesson. And so on. So, one day, when they sat down to lessons, each of them found a little rhyme at its place. I put the rhymes in to show you that their Mother really did understand a little how children feel about things, and also the kind of words they use, which is the case with very few grown-up people. I suppose most grown-ups have very bad memories, and have forgotten how they felt when they were little. Of course, the verses are supposed to be spoken by the children.                PETER      I once thought Caesar easy pap,         How very soft I must have been!      When they start Caesar with a chap        He little know what that will mean.      Oh, verbs are silly stupid things.      I'd rather learn the dates of kings!                BOBBIE      The worst of all my lesson things        Is learning who succeeded who      In all the rows of queens and kings,        With dates to everything they do:      With dates enough to make you sick;,       I wish it was Arithmetic!                PHYLLIS      Such pounds and pounds of apples fill        My slate, what is the price you'd spend?      You scratch the figures out until        You cry upon the dividend.      I'd break the slate and scream for joy      If I did Latin like a boy! This kind of thing, of course, made lessons much jollier. It is something to know that the person who is teaching you sees that it is not all plain sailing for you, and does not think that it is just your stupidness that makes you not know your lessons till you've learned them! Then as Jim's leg got better it was very pleasant to go up and sit with him and hear tales about his school life and the other boys. There was one boy, named Parr, of whom Jim seemed to have formed the lowest possible opinion, and another boy named Wigsby Minor, for whose views Jim had a great respect. Also there were three brothers named Paley, and the youngest was called Paley Terts, and was much given to fighting. Peter drank in all this with deep joy, and Mother seemed to have listened with some interest, for one day she gave Jim a sheet of paper on which she had written a rhyme about Parr, bringing in Paley and Wigsby by name in a most wonderful way, as well as all the reasons Jim had for not liking Parr, and Wigsby's wise opinion on the matter. Jim was immensely pleased. He had never had a rhyme written expressly for him before. He read it till he knew it by heart and then he sent it to Wigsby, who liked it almost as much as Jim did. Perhaps you may like it, too.                THE NEW BOY      His name is Parr:  he says that he      Is given bread and milk for tea.      He says his father killed a bear.      He says his mother cuts his hair.      He wears goloshes when it's wet.      I've heard his people call him “Pet”!      He has no proper sense of shame;      He told the chaps his Christian name.      He cannot wicket-keep at all,      He's frightened of a cricket ball.      He reads indoors for hours and hours.      He knows the names of beastly flowers.      He says his French just like Mossoo,       A beastly stuck-up thing to do,       He won't keep  cave , shirks his turn      And says he came to school to learn!      He won't play football, says it hurts;      He wouldn't fight with Paley Terts;      He couldn't whistle if he tried,      And when we laughed at him he cried!      Now Wigsby Minor says that Parr      Is only like all new boys are.      I know when  I  first came to school      I wasn't such a jolly fool! Jim could never understand how Mother could have been clever enough to do it. To the others it seemed nice, but natural. You see they had always been used to having a mother who could write verses just like the way people talk, even to the shocking expression at the end of the rhyme, which was Jim's very own. Jim taught Peter to play chess and draughts and dominoes, and altogether it was a nice quiet time. Only Jim's leg got better and better, and a general feeling began to spring up among Bobbie, Peter, and Phyllis that something ought to be done to amuse him; not just games, but something really handsome. But it was extraordinarily difficult to think of anything. “It's no good,” said Peter, when all of them had thought and thought till their heads felt quite heavy and swollen; “if we can't think of anything to amuse him, we just can't, and there's an end of it. Perhaps something will just happen of its own accord that he'll like.” “Things DO happen by themselves sometimes, without your making them,”  said Phyllis, rather as though, usually, everything that happened in the world was her doing. “I wish something would happen,” said Bobbie, dreamily, “something wonderful.” And something wonderful did happen exactly four days after she had said this. I wish I could say it was three days after, because in fairy tales it is always three days after that things happen. But this is not a fairy story, and besides, it really was four and not three, and I am nothing if not strictly truthful. They seemed to be hardly Railway children at all in those days, and as the days went on each had an uneasy feeling about this which Phyllis expressed one day. “I wonder if the Railway misses us,” she said, plaintively. “We never go to see it now.” “It seems ungrateful,” said Bobbie; “we loved it so when we hadn't anyone else to play with.” “Perks is always coming up to ask after Jim,” said Peter, “and the signalman's little boy is better. He told me so.” “I didn't mean the people,” explained Phyllis; “I meant the dear Railway itself.” “The thing I don't like,” said Bobbie, on this fourth day, which was a Tuesday, “is our having stopped waving to the 9.15 and sending our love to Father by it.” “Let's begin again,” said Phyllis. And they did. Somehow the change of everything that was made by having servants in the house and Mother not doing any writing, made the time seem extremely long since that strange morning at the beginning of things, when they had got up so early and burnt the bottom out of the kettle and had apple pie for breakfast and first seen the Railway. It was September now, and the turf on the slope to the Railway was dry and crisp. Little long grass spikes stood up like bits of gold wire, frail blue harebells trembled on their tough, slender stalks, Gipsy roses opened wide and flat their lilac-coloured discs, and the golden stars of St. John's Wort shone at the edges of the pool that lay halfway to the Railway. Bobbie gathered a generous handful of the flowers and thought how pretty they would look lying on the green-and-pink blanket of silk-waste that now covered Jim's poor broken leg. “Hurry up,” said Peter, “or we shall miss the 9.15!” “I can't hurry more than I am doing,” said Phyllis. “Oh, bother it! My bootlace has come undone AGAIN!” “When you're married,” said Peter, “your bootlace will come undone going up the church aisle, and your man that you're going to get married to will tumble over it and smash his nose in on the ornamented pavement; and then you'll say you won't marry him, and you'll have to be an old maid.” “I shan't,” said Phyllis. “I'd much rather marry a man with his nose smashed in than not marry anybody.” “It would be horrid to marry a man with a smashed nose, all the same,”  went on Bobbie. “He wouldn't be able to smell the flowers at the wedding. Wouldn't that be awful!” “Bother the flowers at the wedding!” cried Peter. “Look! the signal's down. We must run!” They ran. And once more they waved their handkerchiefs, without at all minding whether the handkerchiefs were clean or not, to the 9.15. “Take our love to Father!” cried Bobbie. And the others, too, shouted:,  “Take our love to Father!” The old gentleman waved from his first-class carriage window. Quite violently he waved. And there was nothing odd in that, for he always had waved. But what was really remarkable was that from every window handkerchiefs fluttered, newspapers signalled, hands waved wildly. The train swept by with a rustle and roar, the little pebbles jumped and danced under it as it passed, and the children were left looking at each other. “Well!” said Peter. “WELL!” said Bobbie. “ WELL! ” said Phyllis. “Whatever on earth does that mean?” asked Peter, but he did not expect any answer. “ I  don't know,” said Bobbie. “Perhaps the old gentleman told the people at his station to look out for us and wave. He knew we should like it!” Now, curiously enough, this was just what had happened. The old gentleman, who was very well known and respected at his particular station, had got there early that morning, and he had waited at the door where the young man stands holding the interesting machine that clips the tickets, and he had said something to every single passenger who passed through that door. And after nodding to what the old gentleman had said, and the nods expressed every shade of surprise, interest, doubt, cheerful pleasure, and grumpy agreement, each passenger had gone on to the platform and read one certain part of his newspaper. And when the passengers got into the train, they had told the other passengers who were already there what the old gentleman had said, and then the other passengers had also looked at their newspapers and seemed very astonished and, mostly, pleased. Then, when the train passed the fence where the three children were, newspapers and hands and handkerchiefs were waved madly, till all that side of the train was fluttery with white like the pictures of the King's Coronation in the biograph at Maskelyne and Cook's. To the children it almost seemed as though the train itself was alive, and was at last responding to the love that they had given it so freely and so long. “It is most extraordinarily rum!” said Peter. “Most stronery!” echoed Phyllis. But Bobbie said, “Don't you think the old gentleman's waves seemed more significating than usual?” “No,” said the others. “I do,” said Bobbie. “I thought he was trying to explain something to us with his newspaper.” “Explain what?” asked Peter, not unnaturally. “ I  don't know,” Bobbie answered, “but I do feel most awfully funny. I feel just exactly as if something was going to happen.” “What is going to happen,” said Peter, “is that Phyllis's stocking is going to come down.” This was but too true. The suspender had given way in the agitation of the waves to the 9.15. Bobbie's handkerchief served as first aid to the injured, and they all went home. Lessons were more than usually difficult to Bobbie that day. Indeed, she disgraced herself so deeply over a quite simple sum about the division of 48 pounds of meat and 36 pounds of bread among 144 hungry children that Mother looked at her anxiously. “Don't you feel quite well, dear?” she asked. “I don't know,” was Bobbie's unexpected answer. “I don't know how I feel. It isn't that I'm lazy. Mother, will you let me off lessons to-day? I feel as if I wanted to be quite alone by myself.” “Yes, of course I'll let you off,” said Mother; “but, ” Bobbie dropped her slate. It cracked just across the little green mark that is so useful for drawing patterns round, and it was never the same slate again. Without waiting to pick it up she bolted. Mother caught her in the hall feeling blindly among the waterproofs and umbrellas for her garden hat. “What is it, my sweetheart?” said Mother. “You don't feel ill, do you?” “I DON'T know,” Bobbie answered, a little breathlessly, “but I want to be by myself and see if my head really IS all silly and my inside all squirmy-twisty.” “Hadn't you better lie down?” Mother said, stroking her hair back from her forehead. “I'd be more alive in the garden, I think,” said Bobbie. But she could not stay in the garden. The hollyhocks and the asters and the late roses all seemed to be waiting for something to happen. It was one of those still, shiny autumn days, when everything does seem to be waiting. Bobbie could not wait. “I'll go down to the station,” she said, “and talk to Perks and ask about the signalman's little boy.” So she went down. On the way she passed the old lady from the Post-office, who gave her a kiss and a hug, but, rather to Bobbie's surprise, no words except:,  “God bless you, love, ” and, after a pause, “run along, do.” The draper's boy, who had sometimes been a little less than civil and a little more than contemptuous, now touched his cap, and uttered the remarkable words:,  “'Morning, Miss, I'm sure, ” The blacksmith, coming along with an open newspaper in his hand, was even more strange in his manner. He grinned broadly, though, as a rule, he was a man not given to smiles, and waved the newspaper long before he came up to her. And as he passed her, he said, in answer to her “Good morning”:,  “Good morning to you, Missie, and many of them! I wish you joy, that I do!” “Oh!” said Bobbie to herself, and her heart quickened its beats, “something IS going to happen! I know it is, everyone is so odd, like people are in dreams.” The Station Master wrung her hand warmly. In fact he worked it up and down like a pump-handle. But he gave her no reason for this unusually enthusiastic greeting. He only said:,  “The 11.54's a bit late, Miss, the extra luggage this holiday time,”  and went away very quickly into that inner Temple of his into which even Bobbie dared not follow him. Perks was not to be seen, and Bobbie shared the solitude of the platform with the Station Cat. This tortoiseshell lady, usually of a retiring disposition, came to-day to rub herself against the brown stockings of Bobbie with arched back, waving tail, and reverberating purrs. “Dear me!” said Bobbie, stooping to stroke her, “how very kind everybody is to-day, even you, Pussy!” Perks did not appear until the 11.54 was signalled, and then he, like everybody else that morning, had a newspaper in his hand. “Hullo!” he said, “'ere you are. Well, if THIS is the train, it'll be smart work! Well, God bless you, my dear! I see it in the paper, and I don't think I was ever so glad of anything in all my born days!” He looked at Bobbie a moment, then said, “One I must have, Miss, and no offence, I know, on a day like this 'ere!” and with that he kissed her, first on one cheek and then on the other. “You ain't offended, are you?” he asked anxiously. “I ain't took too great a liberty? On a day like this, you know, ” “No, no,” said Bobbie, “of course it's not a liberty, dear Mr. Perks; we love you quite as much as if you were an uncle of ours, but, on a day like WHAT?” “Like this 'ere!” said Perks. “Don't I tell you I see it in the paper?” “Saw WHAT in the paper?” asked Bobbie, but already the 11.54 was steaming into the station and the Station Master was looking at all the places where Perks was not and ought to have been. Bobbie was left standing alone, the Station Cat watching her from under the bench with friendly golden eyes. Of course you know already exactly what was going to happen. Bobbie was not so clever. She had the vague, confused, expectant feeling that comes to one's heart in dreams. What her heart expected I can't tell, perhaps the very thing that you and I know was going to happen, but her mind expected nothing; it was almost blank, and felt nothing but tiredness and stupidness and an empty feeling, like your body has when you have been a long walk and it is very far indeed past your proper dinner-time. Only three people got out of the 11.54. The first was a countryman with two baskety boxes full of live chickens who stuck their russet heads out anxiously through the wicker bars; the second was Miss Peckitt, the grocer's wife's cousin, with a tin box and three brown-paper parcels; and the third,  “Oh! my Daddy, my Daddy!” That scream went like a knife into the heart of everyone in the train, and people put their heads out of the windows to see a tall pale man with lips set in a thin close line, and a little girl clinging to him with arms and legs, while his arms went tightly round her.                                                                   “I knew something wonderful was going to happen,” said Bobbie, as they went up the road, “but I didn't think it was going to be this. Oh, my Daddy, my Daddy!” “Then didn't Mother get my letter?” Father asked. “There weren't any letters this morning. Oh! Daddy! it IS really you, isn't it?” The clasp of a hand she had not forgotten assured her that it was. “You must go in by yourself, Bobbie, and tell Mother quite quietly that it's all right. They've caught the man who did it. Everyone knows now that it wasn't your Daddy.” “ I  always knew it wasn't,” said Bobbie. “Me and Mother and our old gentleman.” “Yes,” he said, “it's all his doing. Mother wrote and told me you had found out. And she told me what you'd been to her. My own little girl!”  They stopped a minute then. And now I see them crossing the field. Bobbie goes into the house, trying to keep her eyes from speaking before her lips have found the right words to “tell Mother quite quietly” that the sorrow and the struggle and the parting are over and done, and that Father has come home. I see Father walking in the garden, waiting, waiting. He is looking at the flowers, and each flower is a miracle to eyes that all these months of Spring and Summer have seen only flagstones and gravel and a little grudging grass. But his eyes keep turning towards the house. And presently he leaves the garden and goes to stand outside the nearest door. It is the back door, and across the yard the swallows are circling. They are getting ready to fly away from cold winds and keen frost to the land where it is always summer. They are the same swallows that the children built the little clay nests for. Now the house door opens. Bobbie's voice calls:,  “Come in, Daddy; come in!” He goes in and the door is shut. I think we will not open the door or follow him. I think that just now we are not wanted there. I think it will be best for us to go quickly and quietly away. At the end of the field, among the thin gold spikes of grass and the harebells and Gipsy roses and St. John's Wort, we may just take one last look, over our shoulders, at the white house where neither we nor anyone else is wanted now. CHAPTER I BEAUTIFUL AS THE DAY The house was three miles from the station, but, before the dusty hired hack had rattled along for five minutes, the children began to put their heads out of the carriage window and say, 'Aren't we nearly there?' And every time they passed a house, which was not very often, they all said, 'Oh,  is  this it?' But it never was, till they reached the very top of the hill, just past the chalk-quarry and before you come to the gravel-pit. And then there was a white house with a green garden and an orchard beyond, and mother said, 'Here we are!' 'How white the house is,' said Robert. 'And look at the roses,' said Anthea. 'And the plums,' said Jane. 'It is rather decent,' Cyril admitted. The Baby said, 'Wanty go walky;' and the hack stopped with a last rattle and jolt. Everyone got its legs kicked or its feet trodden on in the scramble to get out of the carriage that very minute, but no one seemed to mind. Mother, curiously enough, was in no hurry to get out; and even when she had come down slowly and by the step, and with no jump at all, she seemed to wish to see the boxes carried in, and even to pay the driver, instead of joining in that first glorious rush round the garden and orchard and the thorny, thistly, briery, brambly wilderness beyond the broken gate and the dry fountain at the side of the house. But the children were wiser, for once. It was not really a pretty house at all; it was quite ordinary, and mother thought it was rather inconvenient, and was quite annoyed at there being no shelves, to speak of, and hardly a cupboard in the place. Father used to say that the iron-work on the roof and coping was like an architect's nightmare. But the house was deep in the country, with no other house in sight, and the children had been in London for two years, without so much as once going to the seaside even for a day by an excursion train, and so the White House seemed to them a sort of Fairy Palace set down in an Earthly Paradise. For London is like prison for children, especially if their relations are not rich. [Illustration: That first glorious rush round the garden] Of course there are the shops and theatres, and entertainments and things, but if your people are rather poor you don't get taken to the theatres, and you can't buy things out of the shops; and London has none of those nice things that children may play with without hurting the things or themselves, such as trees and sand and woods and waters. And nearly everything in London is the wrong sort of shape, all straight lines and flat streets, instead of being all sorts of odd shapes, like things are in the country. Trees are all different, as you know, and I am sure some tiresome person must have told you that there are no two blades of grass exactly alike. But in streets, where the blades of grass don't grow, everything is like everything else. This is why many children who live in the towns are so extremely naughty. They do not know what is the matter with them, and no more do their fathers and mothers, aunts, uncles, cousins, tutors, governesses, and nurses; but I know. And so do you, now. Children in the country are naughty sometimes, too, but that is for quite different reasons. The children had explored the gardens and the outhouses thoroughly before they were caught and cleaned for tea, and they saw quite well that they were certain to be happy at the White House. They thought so from the first moment, but when they found the back of the house covered with jasmine, all in white flower, and smelling like a bottle of the most expensive perfume that is ever given for a birthday present; and when they had seen the lawn, all green and smooth, and quite different from the brown grass in the gardens at Camden Town; and when they found the stable with a loft over it and some old hay still left, they were almost certain; and when Robert had found the broken swing and tumbled out of it and got a bump on his head the size of an egg, and Cyril had nipped his finger in the door of a hutch that seemed made to keep rabbits in, if you ever had any, they had no longer any doubts whatever. [Illustration: Cyril had nipped his finger in the door of a hutch] The best part of it all was that there were no rules about not going to places and not doing things. In London almost everything is labelled 'You mustn't touch,' and though the label is invisible it's just as bad, because you know it's there, or if you don't you very soon get told. The White House was on the edge of a hill, with a wood behind it, and the chalk-quarry on one side and the gravel-pit on the other. Down at the bottom of the hill was a level plain, with queer-shaped white buildings where people burnt lime, and a big red brewery and other houses; and when the big chimneys were smoking and the sun was setting, the valley looked as if it was filled with golden mist, and the limekilns and hop-drying houses glimmered and glittered till they were like an enchanted city out of the  Arabian Nights . Now that I have begun to tell you about the place, I feel that I could go on and make this into a most interesting story about all the ordinary things that the children did,, just the kind of things you do yourself, you know, and you would believe every word of it; and when I told about the children's being tiresome, as you are sometimes, your aunts would perhaps write in the margin of the story with a pencil, 'How true!' or 'How like life!' and you would see it and would very likely be annoyed. So I will only tell you the really astonishing things that happened, and you may leave the book about quite safely, for no aunts and uncles either are likely to write 'How true!' on the edge of the story. Grown-up people find it very difficult to believe really wonderful things, unless they have what they call proof. But children will believe almost anything, and grown-ups know this. That is why they tell you that the earth is round like an orange, when you can see perfectly well that it is flat and lumpy; and why they say that the earth goes round the sun, when you can see for yourself any day that the sun gets up in the morning and goes to bed at night like a good sun as it is, and the earth knows its place, and lies as still as a mouse. Yet I daresay you believe all that about the earth and the sun, and if so you will find it quite easy to believe that before Anthea and Cyril and the others had been a week in the country they had found a fairy. At least they called it that, because that was what it called itself; and of course it knew best, but it was not at all like any fairy you ever saw or heard of or read about. It was at the gravel-pits. Father had to go away suddenly on business, and mother had gone away to stay with Granny, who was not very well. They both went in a great hurry, and when they were gone the house seemed dreadfully quiet and empty, and the children wandered from one room to another and looked at the bits of paper and string on the floors left over from the packing, and not yet cleared up, and wished they had something to do. It was Cyril who said,  'I say, let's take our spades and dig in the gravel-pits. We can pretend it's seaside.' 'Father says it was once,' Anthea said; 'he says there are shells there thousands of years old.' So they went. Of course they had been to the edge of the gravel-pit and looked over, but they had not gone down into it for fear father should say they mustn't play there, and it was the same with the chalk-quarry. The gravel-pit is not really dangerous if you don't try to climb down the edges, but go the slow safe way round by the road, as if you were a cart. Each of the children carried its own spade, and took it in turns to carry the Lamb. He was the baby, and they called him that because 'Baa' was the first thing he ever said. They called Anthea 'Panther,' which seems silly when you read it, but when you say it it sounds a little like her name. The gravel-pit is very large and wide, with grass growing round the edges at the top, and dry stringy wildflowers, purple and yellow. It is like a giant's washbowl. And there are mounds of gravel, and holes in the sides of the bowl where gravel has been taken out, and high up in the steep sides there are the little holes that are the little front doors of the little bank-martins' little houses. The children built a castle, of course, but castle-building is rather poor fun when you have no hope of the swishing tide ever coming in to fill up the moat and wash away the drawbridge, and, at the happy last, to wet everybody up to the waist at least. Cyril wanted to dig out a cave to play smugglers in, but the others thought it might bury them alive, so it ended in all spades going to work to dig a hole through the castle to Australia. These children, you see, believed that the world was round, and that on the other side the little Australian boys and girls were really walking wrong way up, like flies on the ceiling, with their heads hanging down into the air. The children dug and they dug and they dug, and their hands got sandy and hot and red, and their faces got damp and shiny. The Lamb had tried to eat the sand, and had cried so hard when he found that it was not, as he had supposed, brown sugar, that he was now tired out, and was lying asleep in a warm fat bunch in the middle of the half-finished castle. This left his brothers and sisters free to work really hard, and the hole that was to come out in Australia soon grew so deep that Jane, who was called Pussy for short, begged the others to stop. 'Suppose the bottom of the hole gave way suddenly,' said she, 'and you tumbled out among the little Australians, all the sand would get in their eyes.' 'Yes,' said Robert; 'and they would hate us, and throw stones at us, and not let us see the kangaroos, or opossums, or bluegums, or Emu Brand birds, or anything.' Cyril and Anthea knew that Australia was not quite so near as all that, but they agreed to stop using the spades and to go on with their hands. This was quite easy, because the sand at the bottom of the hole was very soft and fine and dry, like sea-sand. And there were little shells in it. 'Fancy it having been wet sea here once, all sloppy and shiny,' said Jane, 'with fishes and conger-eels and coral and mermaids.' 'And masts of ships and wrecked Spanish treasure. I wish we could find a gold doubloon, or something,' Cyril said. 'How did the sea get carried away?' Robert asked. 'Not in a pail, silly,' said his brother. 'Father says the earth got too hot underneath, as you do in bed sometimes, so it just hunched up its shoulders, and the sea had to slip off, like the blankets do us, and the shoulder was left sticking out, and turned into dry land. Let's go and look for shells; I think that little cave looks likely, and I see something sticking out there like a bit of wrecked ship's anchor, and it's beastly hot in the Australian hole.' The others agreed, but Anthea went on digging. She always liked to finish a thing when she had once begun it. She felt it would be a disgrace to leave that hole without getting through to Australia. The cave was disappointing, because there were no shells, and the wrecked ship's anchor turned out to be only the broken end of a pick-axe handle, and the cave party were just making up their minds that sand makes you thirstier when it is not by the seaside, and someone had suggested that they all go home for lemonade, when Anthea suddenly screamed,  'Cyril! Come here! Oh, come quick, It's alive! It'll get away! Quick!' They all hurried back. 'It's a rat, I shouldn't wonder,' said Robert. 'Father says they infest old places, and this must be pretty old if the sea was here thousands of years ago',  'Perhaps it is a snake,' said Jane, shuddering. 'Let's look,' said Cyril, jumping into the hole. 'I'm not afraid of snakes. I like them. If it is a snake I'll tame it, and it will follow me everywhere, and I'll let it sleep round my neck at night.' 'No, you won't,' said Robert firmly. He shared Cyril's bedroom. 'But you may if it's a rat.' [Illustration: Anthea suddenly screamed, 'It's alive!'] 'Oh, don't be silly!' said Anthea; 'it's not a rat, it's  much  bigger. And it's not a snake. It's got feet; I saw them; and fur! No, not the spade. You'll hurt it! Dig with your hands.' 'And let  it  hurt  me  instead! That's so likely, isn't it?' said Cyril, seizing a spade. 'Oh, don't!' said Anthea. 'Squirrel,  don't . I, it sounds silly, but it said something. It really and truly did',  'What?' 'It said, 'You let me alone.'' But Cyril merely observed that his sister must have gone off her head, and he and Robert dug with spades while Anthea sat on the edge of the hole, jumping up and down with hotness and anxiety. They dug carefully, and presently everyone could see that there really was something moving in the bottom of the Australian hole. Then Anthea cried out, ' I'm  not afraid. Let me dig,' and fell on her knees and began to scratch like a dog does when he has suddenly remembered where it was that he buried his bone. 'Oh, I felt fur,' she cried, half laughing and half crying. 'I did indeed! I did!' when suddenly a dry husky voice in the sand made them all jump back, and their hearts jumped nearly as fast as they did. 'Let me alone,' it said. And now everyone heard the voice and looked at the others to see if they had heard it too. 'But we want to see you,' said Robert bravely. 'I wish you'd come out,' said Anthea, also taking courage. 'Oh, well, if that's your wish,' the voice said, and the sand stirred and spun and scattered, and something brown and furry and fat came rolling out into the hole, and the sand fell off it, and it sat there yawning and rubbing the ends of its eyes with its hands. 'I believe I must have dropped asleep,' it said, stretching itself. The children stood round the hole in a ring, looking at the creature they had found. It was worth looking at. Its eyes were on long horns like a snail's eyes, and it could move them in and out like telescopes; it had ears like a bat's ears, and its tubby body was shaped like a spider's and covered with thick soft fur; its legs and arms were furry too, and it had hands and feet like a monkey's. 'What on earth is it?' Jane said. 'Shall we take it home?' The thing turned its long eyes to look at her, and said,  'Does she always talk nonsense, or is it only the rubbish on her head that makes her silly?' It looked scornfully at Jane's hat as it spoke. 'She doesn't mean to be silly,' Anthea said gently; 'we none of us do, whatever you may think! Don't be frightened; we don't want to hurt you, you know.' 'Hurt  me !' it said. ' Me  frightened? Upon my word! Why, you talk as if I were nobody in particular.' All its fur stood out like a cat's when it is going to fight. 'Well,' said Anthea, still kindly, 'perhaps if we knew who you are in particular we could think of something to say that wouldn't make you angry. Everything we've said so far seems to have done so. Who are you? And don't get angry! Because really we don't know.' 'You don't know?' it said. 'Well, I knew the world had changed, but, well, really, Do you mean to tell me seriously you don't know a Psammead when you see one?' 'A Sammyadd? That's Greek to me.' 'So it is to everyone,' said the creature sharply. 'Well, in plain English, then, a  Sand-fairy . Don't you know a Sand-fairy when you see one?' It looked so grieved and hurt that Jane hastened to say, 'Of course I see you are,  now . It's quite plain now one comes to look at you.' 'You came to look at me, several sentences ago,' it said crossly, beginning to curl up again in the sand. 'Oh, don't go away again! Do talk some more,' Robert cried. 'I didn't know you were a Sand-fairy, but I knew directly I saw you that you were much the wonderfullest thing I'd ever seen.' The Sand-fairy seemed a shade less disagreeable after this. 'It isn't talking I mind,' it said, 'as long as you're reasonably civil. But I'm not going to make polite conversation for you. If you talk nicely to me, perhaps I'll answer you, and perhaps I won't. Now say something.' Of course no one could think of anything to say, but at last Robert thought of 'How long have you lived here?' and he said it at once. 'Oh, ages, several thousand years,' replied the Psammead. 'Tell us about it. Do.' 'It's all in books.' ' You  aren't!' Jane said. 'Oh, tell us everything you can about yourself! We don't know anything about you, and you  are  so nice.' The Sand-fairy smoothed his long rat-like whiskers and smiled between them. 'Do please tell!' said the children all together. It is wonderful how quickly you get used to things, even the most astonishing. Five minutes before, the children had had no more idea than you had that there was such a thing as a Sand-fairy in the world, and now they were talking to it as though they had known it all their lives. It drew its eyes in and said,  'How very sunny it is, quite like old times! Where do you get your Megatheriums from now?' 'What?' said the children all at once. It is very difficult always to remember that 'what' is not polite, especially in moments of surprise or agitation. 'Are Pterodactyls plentiful now?' the Sand-fairy went on. The children were unable to reply. 'What do you have for breakfast?' the Fairy said impatiently, 'and who gives it to you?' 'Eggs and bacon, and bread and milk, and porridge and things. Mother gives it to us. What are Mega-what's-its-names and Ptero-what-do-you-call-thems? And does anyone have them for breakfast?' 'Why, almost everyone had Pterodactyl for breakfast in my time! Pterodactyls were something like crocodiles and something like birds, I believe they were very good grilled. You see, it was like this: of course there were heaps of Sand-fairies then, and in the morning early you went out and hunted for them, and when you'd found one it gave you your wish. People used to send their little boys down to the seashore in the morning before breakfast to get the day's wishes, and very often the eldest boy in the family would be told to wish for a Megatherium, ready jointed for cooking. It was as big as an elephant, you see, so there was a good deal of meat on it. And if they wanted fish, the Ichthyosaurus was asked for,, he was twenty to forty feet long, so there was plenty of him. And for poultry there was the Plesiosaurus; there were nice pickings on that too. Then the other children could wish for other things. But when people had dinner-parties it was nearly always Megatheriums; and Ichthyosaurus, because his fins were a great delicacy and his tail made soup.' 'There must have been heaps and heaps of cold meat left over,' said Anthea, who meant to be a good housekeeper some day. 'Oh no,' said the Psammead, 'that would never have done. Why, of course at sunset what was left over turned into stone. You find the stone bones of the Megatherium and things all over the place even now, they tell me.' 'Who tell you?' asked Cyril; but the Sand-fairy frowned and began to dig very fast with its furry hands. 'Oh, don't go!' they all cried; 'tell us more about when it was Megatheriums for breakfast! Was the world like this then?' It stopped digging. 'Not a bit,' it said; 'it was nearly all sand where I lived, and coal grew on trees, and the periwinkles were as big as tea-trays, you find them now; they're turned into stone. We Sand-fairies used to live on the seashore, and the children used to come with their little flint-spades and flint-pails and make castles for us to live in. That's thousands of years ago, but I hear that children still build castles on the sand. It's difficult to break yourself of a habit.' 'But why did you stop living in the castles?' asked Robert. 'It's a sad story,' said the Psammead gloomily. 'It was because they  would  build moats to the castles, and the nasty wet bubbling sea used to come in, and of course as soon as a Sand-fairy got wet it caught cold, and generally died. And so there got to be fewer and fewer, and, whenever you found a fairy and had a wish, you used to wish for a Megatherium, and eat twice as much as you wanted, because it might be weeks before you got another wish.' 'And did  you  get wet?' Robert inquired. The Sand-fairy shuddered. 'Only once,' it said; 'the end of the twelfth hair of my top left whisker, I feel the place still in damp weather. It was only once, but it was quite enough for me. I went away as soon as the sun had dried my poor dear whisker. I scurried away to the back of the beach, and dug myself a house deep in warm dry sand, and there I've been ever since. And the sea changed its lodgings afterwards. And now I'm not going to tell you another thing.' 'Just one more, please,' said the children. 'Can you give wishes now?' 'Of course,' said it; 'didn't I give you yours a few minutes ago? You said, 'I wish you'd come out,' and I did.' 'Oh, please, mayn't we have another?' 'Yes, but be quick about it. I'm tired of you.' I daresay you have often thought what you would do if you had three wishes given you, and have despised the old man and his wife in the black-pudding story, and felt certain that if you had the chance you could think of three really useful wishes without a moment's hesitation. These children had often talked this matter over, but, now the chance had suddenly come to them, they could not make up their minds. 'Quick,' said the Sand-fairy crossly. No one could think of anything, only Anthea did manage to remember a private wish of her own and Jane's which they had never told the boys. She knew the boys would not care about it, but still it was better than nothing. 'I wish we were all as beautiful as the day,' she said in a great hurry. The children looked at each other, but each could see that the others were not any better-looking than usual. The Psammead pushed out his long eyes, and seemed to be holding its breath and swelling itself out till it was twice as fat and furry as before. Suddenly it let its breath go in a long sigh. 'I'm really afraid I can't manage it,' it said apologetically; 'I must be out of practice.' The children were horribly disappointed. 'Oh,  do  try again!' they said. 'Well,' said the Sand-fairy, 'the fact is, I was keeping back a little strength to give the rest of you your wishes with. If you'll be contented with one wish a day among the lot of you I daresay I can screw myself up to it. Do you agree to that?' 'Yes, oh yes!' said Jane and Anthea. The boys nodded. They did not believe the Sand-fairy could do it. You can always make girls believe things much easier than you can boys. It stretched out its eyes farther than ever, and swelled and swelled and swelled. 'I do hope it won't hurt itself,' said Anthea. 'Or crack its skin,' Robert said anxiously. Everyone was very much relieved when the Sand-fairy, after getting so big that it almost filled up the hole in the sand, suddenly let out its breath and went back to its proper size. 'That's all right,' it said, panting heavily. 'It'll come easier to-morrow.' 'Did it hurt much?' said Anthea. 'Only my poor whisker, thank you,' said he, 'but you're a kind and thoughtful child. Good day.' It scratched suddenly and fiercely with its hands and feet, and disappeared in the sand. Then the children looked at each other, and each child suddenly found itself alone with three perfect strangers, all radiantly beautiful. They stood for some moments in silence. Each thought that its brothers and sisters had wandered off, and that these strange children had stolen up unnoticed while it was watching the swelling form of the Sand-fairy. Anthea spoke first,  'Excuse me,' she said very politely to Jane, who now had enormous blue eyes and a cloud of russet hair, 'but have you seen two little boys and a little girl anywhere about?' 'I was just going to ask you that,' said Jane. And then Cyril cried,  'Why, it's  you ! I know the hole in your pinafore! You  are  Jane, aren't you? And you're the Panther; I can see your dirty handkerchief that you forgot to change after you'd cut your thumb! The wish  has  come off, after all. I say, am I as handsome as you are?' 'If you're Cyril, I liked you much better as you were before,' said Anthea decidedly. 'You look like the picture of the young chorister, with your golden hair; you'll die young, I shouldn't wonder. And if that's Robert, he's like an Italian organ-grinder. His hair's all black.' 'You two girls are like Christmas cards, then, that's all, silly Christmas cards,' said Robert angrily. 'And Jane's hair is simply carrots.' It was indeed of that Venetian tint so much admired by artists. 'Well, it's no use finding fault with each other,' said Anthea; 'let's get the Lamb and lug it home to dinner. The servants will admire us most awfully, you'll see.' Baby was just waking up when they got to him, and not one of the children but was relieved to find that he at least was not as beautiful as the day, but just the same as usual. 'I suppose he's too young to have wishes naturally,' said Jane. 'We shall have to mention him specially next time.' Anthea ran forward and held out her arms. 'Come, then,' she said. The Baby looked at her disapprovingly, and put a sandy pink thumb in his mouth. Anthea was his favourite sister. 'Come, then,' she said. 'G'way 'long!' said the Baby. 'Come to own Pussy,' said Jane. 'Wants my Panty,' said the Lamb dismally, and his lip trembled. 'Here, come on, Veteran,' said Robert, 'come and have a yidey on Yobby's back.' 'Yah, narky narky boy,' howled the Baby, giving way altogether. Then the children knew the worst.  The Baby did not know them!  [Illustration: The baby did not know them!] They looked at each other in despair, and it was terrible to each, in this dire emergency, to meet only the beautiful eyes of perfect strangers, instead of the merry, friendly, commonplace, twinkling, jolly little eyes of its own brothers and sisters. 'This is most truly awful,' said Cyril when he had tried to lift up the Lamb, and the Lamb had scratched like a cat and bellowed like a bull! 'We've got to  make friends  with him! I can't carry him home screaming like that. Fancy having to make friends with our own baby!, it's too silly.' That, however, was exactly what they had to do. It took over an hour, and the task was not rendered any easier by the fact that the Lamb was by this time as hungry as a lion and as thirsty as a desert. At last he consented to allow these strangers to carry him home by turns, but as he refused to hold on to such new acquaintances he was a dead weight, and most exhausting. 'Thank goodness, we're home!' said Jane, staggering through the iron gate to where Martha, the nursemaid, stood at the front door shading her eyes with her hand and looking out anxiously. 'Here! Do take Baby!' Martha snatched the Baby from her arms. 'Thanks be,  he's  safe back,' she said. 'Where are the others, and whoever to goodness gracious are all of you?' 'We're  us , of course,' said Robert. 'And who's Us, when you're at home?' asked Martha scornfully. 'I tell you it's  us , only we're beautiful as the day,' said Cyril. 'I'm Cyril, and these are the others, and we're jolly hungry. Let us in, and don't be a silly idiot.' Martha merely dratted Cyril's impudence and tried to shut the door in his face. 'I know we  look  different, but I'm Anthea, and we're so tired, and it's long past dinner-time.' 'Then go home to your dinners, whoever you are; and if our children put you up to this play-acting you can tell them from me they'll catch it, so they know what to expect!' With that she did bang the door. Cyril rang the bell violently. No answer. Presently cook put her head out of a bedroom window and said,  'If you don't take yourselves off, and that precious sharp, I'll go and fetch the police.' And she slammed down the window. 'It's no good,' said Anthea. 'Oh, do, do come away before we get sent to prison!' The boys said it was nonsense, and the law of England couldn't put you in prison for just being as beautiful as the day, but all the same they followed the others out into the lane. 'We shall be our proper selves after sunset, I suppose,' said Jane. 'I don't know,' Cyril said sadly; 'it mayn't be like that now, things have changed a good deal since Megatherium times.' 'Oh,' cried Anthea suddenly, 'perhaps we shall turn into stone at sunset, like the Megatheriums did, so that there mayn't be any of us left over for the next day.' She began to cry, so did Jane. Even the boys turned pale. No one had the heart to say anything. It was a horrible afternoon. There was no house near where the children could beg a crust of bread or even a glass of water. They were afraid to go to the village, because they had seen Martha go down there with a basket, and there was a local constable. True, they were all as beautiful as the day, but that is a poor comfort when you are as hungry as a hunter and as thirsty as a sponge. Three times they tried in vain to get the servants in the White House to let them in and listen to their tale. And then Robert went alone, hoping to be able to climb in at one of the back windows and so open the door to the others. But all the windows were out of reach, and Martha emptied a toilet-jug of cold water over him from a top window, and said,  'Go along with you, you nasty little Eye-talian monkey.' It came at last to their sitting down in a row under the hedge, with their feet in a dry ditch, waiting for sunset, and wondering whether, when the sun  did  set, they would turn into stone, or only into their own old natural selves; and each of them still felt lonely and among strangers, and tried not to look at the others, for, though their voices were their own, their faces were so radiantly beautiful as to be quite irritating to look at. 'I don't believe we  shall  turn to stone,' said Robert, breaking a long miserable silence, 'because the Sand-fairy said he'd give us another wish to-morrow, and he couldn't if we were stone, could he?' The others said 'No,' but they weren't at all comforted. Another silence, longer and more miserable, was broken by Cyril's suddenly saying, 'I don't want to frighten you girls, but I believe it's beginning with me already. My foot's quite dead. I'm turning to stone, I know I am, and so will you in a minute.' 'Never mind,' said Robert kindly, 'perhaps you'll be the only stone one, and the rest of us will be all right, and we'll cherish your statue and hang garlands on it.' But when it turned out that Cyril's foot had only gone to sleep through his sitting too long with it under him, and when it came to life in an agony of pins and needles, the others were quite cross. 'Giving us such a fright for nothing!' said Anthea. [Illustration: Martha emptied a toilet-jug of cold water over him] The third and miserablest silence of all was broken by Jane. She said,  'If we  do  come out of this all right, we'll ask the Sammyadd to make it so that the servants don't notice anything different, no matter what wishes we have.' The others only grunted. They were too wretched even to make good resolutions. At last hunger and fright and crossness and tiredness, four very nasty things, all joined together to bring one nice thing, and that was sleep. The children lay asleep in a row, with their beautiful eyes shut and their beautiful mouths open. Anthea woke first. The sun had set, and the twilight was coming on. Anthea pinched herself very hard, to make sure, and when she found she could still feel pinching she decided that she was not stone, and then she pinched the others. They, also, were soft. 'Wake up,' she said, almost in tears for joy; 'it's all right, we're not stone. And oh, Cyril, how nice and ugly you do look, with your old freckles and your brown hair and your little eyes. And so do you all!' she added, so that they might not feel jealous. When they got home they were very much scolded by Martha, who told them about the strange children. 'A good-looking lot, I must say, but that impudent.' 'I know,' said Robert, who knew by experience how hopeless it would be to try to explain things to Martha. 'And where on earth have you been all this time, you naughty little things, you?' 'In the lane.' 'Why didn't you come home hours ago?' 'We couldn't because of  them ,' said Anthea. 'Who?' 'The children who were as beautiful as the day. They kept us there till after sunset. We couldn't come back till they'd gone. You don't know how we hated them! Oh, do, do give us some supper, we are so hungry.' 'Hungry! I should think so,' said Martha angrily; 'out all day like this. Well, I hope it'll be a lesson to you not to go picking up with strange children, down here after measles, as likely as not! Now mind, if you see them again, don't you speak to them, not one word nor so much as a look, but come straight away and tell me. I'll spoil their beauty for them!' 'If ever we  do  see them again we'll tell you,' Anthea said; and Robert, fixing his eyes fondly on the cold beef that was being brought in on a tray by cook, added in heartfelt undertones,  'And we'll take jolly good care we never  do  see them again.' And they never have. CHAPTER II GOLDEN GUINEAS Anthea woke in the morning from a very real sort of dream, in which she was walking in the Zoological Gardens on a pouring wet day without an umbrella. The animals seemed desperately unhappy because of the rain, and were all growling gloomily. When she awoke, both the growling and the rain went on just the same. The growling was the heavy regular breathing of her sister Jane, who had a slight cold and was still asleep. The rain fell in slow drops on to Anthea's face from the wet corner of a bath-towel out of which her brother Robert was gently squeezing the water, to wake her up, as he now explained. 'Oh, drop it!' she said rather crossly; so he did, for he was not a brutal brother, though very ingenious in apple-pie beds, booby-traps, original methods of awakening sleeping relatives, and the other little accomplishments which make home happy. [Illustration: The rain fell in slow drops on to Anthea's face] 'I had such a funny dream,' Anthea began. 'So did I,' said Jane, wakening suddenly and without warning. 'I dreamed we found a Sand-fairy in the gravel-pits, and it said it was a Sammyadd, and we might have a new wish every day, and', ,  'But that's what  I  dreamed,' said Robert; 'I was just going to tell you,, and we had the first wish directly it said so. And I dreamed you girls were donkeys enough to ask for us all to be beautiful as day, and we jolly well were, and it was perfectly beastly.' 'But  can  different people all dream the same thing?' said Anthea, sitting up in bed, 'because I dreamed all that as well as about the Zoo and the rain; and Baby didn't know us in my dream, and the servants shut us out of the house because the radiantness of our beauty was such a complete disguise, and', ,  The voice of the eldest brother sounded from across the landing. 'Come on, Robert,' it said, 'you'll be late for breakfast again, unless you mean to shirk your bath as you did on Tuesday.' 'I say, come here a second,' Robert replied; 'I didn't shirk it; I had it after brekker in father's dressing-room because ours was emptied away.' Cyril appeared in the doorway, partially clothed. 'Look here,' said Anthea, 'we've all had such an odd dream. We've all dreamed we found a Sand-fairy.' Her voice died away before Cyril's contemptuous glance. 'Dream?' he said; 'you little sillies, it's  true . I tell you it all happened. That's why I'm so keen on being down early. We'll go up there directly after brekker, and have another wish. Only we'll make up our minds, solid, before we go, what it is we do want, and no one must ask for anything unless the others agree first. No more peerless beauties for this child, thank you. Not if I know it!' The other three dressed, with their mouths open. If all that dream about the Sand-fairy was real, this real dressing seemed very like a dream, the girls thought. Jane felt that Cyril was right, but Anthea was not sure, till after they had seen Martha and heard her full and plain reminders about their naughty conduct the day before. Then Anthea was sure. 'Because,' said she, 'servants never dream anything but the things in the Dream-book, like snakes and oysters and going to a wedding, that means a funeral, and snakes are a false female friend, and oysters are babies.' 'Talking of babies,' said Cyril, 'where's the Lamb?' 'Martha's going to take him to Rochester to see her cousins. Mother said she might. She's dressing him now,' said Jane, 'in his very best coat and hat. Bread-and-butter, please.' 'She seems to like taking him too,' said Robert in a tone of wonder. 'Servants  do  like taking babies to see their relations,' Cyril said; 'I've noticed it before, especially in their best clothes.' 'I expect they pretend they're their own babies, and that they're not servants at all, but married to noble dukes of high degree, and they say the babies are the little dukes and duchesses,' Jane suggested dreamily, taking more marmalade. 'I expect that's what Martha'll say to her cousin. She'll enjoy herself most frightfully.' 'She won't enjoy herself most frightfully carrying our infant duke to Rochester,' said Robert; 'not if she's anything like me, she won't.' 'Fancy walking to Rochester with the Lamb on your back!' said Cyril in full agreement. 'She's gone by the carrier's cart,' said Jane. 'Let's see them off, then we shall have done a polite and kindly act, and we shall be quite sure we've got rid of them for the day.' So they did. Martha wore her Sunday dress of two shades of purple, so tight in the chest that it made her stoop, and her blue hat with the pink cornflowers and white ribbon. She had a yellow-lace collar with a green bow. And the Lamb had indeed his very best cream-colored silk coat and hat. It was a smart party that the carrier's cart picked up at the Cross Roads. When its white tilt and red wheels had slowly vanished in a swirl of chalk-dust,  'And now for the Sammyadd!' said Cyril, and off they went. As they went they decided on the wish they would ask for. Although they were all in a great hurry they did not try to climb down the sides of the gravel-pit, but went round by the safe lower road, as if they had been carts. They had made a ring of stones round the place where the Sand-fairy had disappeared, so they easily found the spot. The sun was burning and bright, and the sky was deep blue, without a cloud. The sand was very hot to touch. 'Oh, suppose it was only a dream, after all,' Robert said as the boys uncovered their spades from the sand-heap where they had buried them and began to dig. 'Suppose you were a sensible chap,' said Cyril; 'one's quite as likely as the other!' 'Suppose you kept a civil tongue in your head,' Robert snapped. 'Suppose we girls take a turn,' said Jane, laughing. 'You boys seem to be getting very warm.' 'Suppose you don't come putting your silly oar in,' said Robert, who was now warm indeed. 'We won't,' said Anthea quickly. 'Robert dear, don't be so grumpy, we won't say a word, you shall be the one to speak to the Fairy and tell him what we've decided to wish for. You'll say it much better than we shall.' 'Suppose you drop being a little humbug,' said Robert, but not crossly. 'Look out, dig with your hands, now!' So they did, and presently uncovered the spider-shaped brown hairy body, long arms and legs, bat's ears and snail's eyes of the Sand-fairy himself. Everyone drew a deep breath of satisfaction, for now of course it couldn't have been a dream. The Psammead sat up and shook the sand out of its fur. 'How's your left whisker this morning?' said Anthea politely. 'Nothing to boast of,' said it; 'it had rather a restless night. But thank you for asking.' 'I say,' said Robert, 'do you feel up to giving wishes to-day, because we very much want an extra besides the regular one? The extra's a very little one,' he added reassuringly. 'Humph!' said the Sand-fairy. (If you read this story aloud, please pronounce 'humph' exactly as it is spelt, for that is how he said it.) 'Humph! Do you know, until I heard you being disagreeable to each other just over my head, and so loud too, I really quite thought I had dreamed you all. I do have very odd dreams sometimes.' 'Do you?' Jane hurried to say, so as to get away from the subject of disagreeableness. 'I wish,' she added politely, 'you'd tell us about your dreams, they must be awfully interesting',  'Is that the day's wish?' said the Sand-fairy, yawning. Cyril muttered something about 'just like a girl,' and the rest stood silent. If they said 'Yes,' then good-bye to the other wishes they had decided to ask for. If they said 'No,' it would be very rude, and they had all been taught manners, and had learned a little too, which is not at all the same thing. A sigh of relief broke from all lips when the Sand-fairy said,  'If I do, I shan't have strength to give you a second wish; not even good tempers, or common-sense, or manners, or little things like that.' 'We don't want you to put yourself out at all about  these  things, we can manage them quite well ourselves,' said Cyril eagerly; while the others looked guiltily at each other, and wished the Fairy would not keep all on about good tempers, but give them one good scolding if it wanted to, and then have done with it. 'Well,' said the Psammead, putting out his long snail's eyes so suddenly that one of them nearly went into the round boy's eye of Robert, 'let's have the little wish first.' 'We don't want the servants to notice the gifts you give us.' 'Are kind enough to give us,' said Anthea in a whisper. 'Are kind enough to give us, I mean,' said Robert. The Fairy swelled himself out a bit, let his breath go, and said,  'I've done  that  for you, it was quite easy. People don't notice things much, anyway. What's the next wish?' 'We want,' said Robert slowly, 'to be rich beyond the dreams of something or other.' 'Avarice,' said Jane. 'So it is,' said the Fairy unexpectedly. 'But it won't do you much good, that's one comfort,' it muttered to itself. 'Come, I can't go beyond dreams, you know! How much do you want, and will you have it in gold or notes?' 'Gold, please, and millions of it',  'This gravel-pit full be enough?' said the Fairy in an off-hand manner. 'Oh  yes ',  'Then go out before I begin, or you'll be buried alive in it.' It made its skinny arms so long, and waved them so frighteningly, that the children ran as hard as they could towards the road by which carts used to come to the gravel-pits. Only Anthea had presence of mind enough to shout a timid 'Good-morning, I hope your whisker will be better to-morrow,' as she ran. On the road they turned and looked back, and they had to shut their eyes, and open them very slowly, a little bit at a time, because the sight was too dazzling for their eyes to be able to bear. It was something like trying to look at the sun at high noon on Midsummer Day. For the whole of the sand-pit was full, right up to the very top, with new shining gold pieces, and all the little bank-martins' little front doors were covered out of sight. Where the road for carts wound into the gravel-pit the gold lay in heaps like stones lie by the roadside, and a great bank of shining gold shelved down from where it lay flat and smooth between the tall sides of the gravel-pit. And all the gleaming heaps was minted gold. And on the sides and edges of these countless coins the mid-day sun shone and sparkled, and glowed and gleamed till the quarry looked like the mouth of a smelting furnace, or one of the fairy halls that you see sometimes in the sky at sunset. The children stood with their mouths open, and no one said a word. At last Robert stooped and picked up one of the loose coins from the edge of the heap by the cart-road, and looked at it. He looked on both sides. Then he said in a low voice, quite different to his own, 'It's not sovereigns.' 'It's gold, anyway,' said Cyril. And now they all began to talk at once. They all picked up the golden treasure by handfuls and let it run through their fingers like water, and the chink it made as it fell was wonderful music. At first they quite forgot to think of spending the money, it was so nice to play with. Jane sat down between two heaps of the gold, and Robert began to bury her, as you bury your father in sand when you are at the seaside and he has gone to sleep on the beach with his newspaper over his face. But Jane was not half buried before she cried out, 'Oh stop, it's too heavy! It hurts!' Robert said 'Bosh!' and went on. 'Let me out, I tell you,' cried Jane, and was taken out, very white, and trembling a little. 'You've no idea what it's like,' said she; 'it's like stones on you, or like chains.' 'Look here,' Cyril said, 'if this is to do us any good, it's no good our staying gasping at it like this. Let's fill our pockets and go and buy things. Don't you forget, it won't last after sunset. I wish we'd asked the Sammyadd why things don't turn to stone. Perhaps this will. I'll tell you what, there's a pony and cart in the village.' 'Do you want to buy that?' asked Jane. 'No, silly,, we'll  hire  it. And then we'll go to Rochester and buy heaps and heaps of things. Look here, let's each take as much as we can carry. But it's not sovereigns. They've got a man's head on one side and a thing like the ace of spades on the other. Fill your pockets with it, I tell you, and come along. You can talk as we go, if you  must  talk.' Cyril sat down and began to fill his pockets. 'You made fun of me for getting father to have nine pockets in my suit,' said he, 'but now you see!' They did. For when Cyril had filled his nine pockets and his handkerchief and the space between himself and his shirt front with the gold coins, he had to stand up. But he staggered, and had to sit down again in a hurry. 'Throw out some of the cargo,' said Robert. 'You'll sink the ship, old chap. That comes of nine pockets.' And Cyril had to do so. Then they set off to walk to the village. It was more than a mile, and the road was very dusty indeed, and the sun seemed to get hotter and hotter, and the gold in their pockets got heavier and heavier. It was Jane who said, 'I don't see how we're to spend it all. There must be thousands of pounds among the lot of us. I'm going to leave some of mine behind this stump in the hedge. And directly we get to the village we'll buy some biscuits; I know it's long past dinner-time.' She took out a handful or two of gold and hid it in the hollows of an old hornbeam. 'How round and yellow they are,' she said. 'Don't you wish they were made of gingerbread and we were going to eat them?' 'Well, they're not, and we're not,' said Cyril. 'Come on!' But they came on heavily and wearily. Before they reached the village, more than one stump in the hedge concealed its little hoard of hidden treasure. Yet they reached the village with about twelve hundred guineas in their pockets. But in spite of this inside wealth they looked quite ordinary outside, and no one would have thought they could have more than a half-crown each at the outside. The haze of heat, the blue of the wood smoke, made a sort of dim misty cloud over the red roofs of the village. The four sat down heavily on the first bench to which they came. It happened to be outside the Blue Boar Inn. [Illustration: He staggered, and had to sit down again in a hurry] It was decided that Cyril should go into the Blue Boar and ask for ginger-beer, because, as Anthea said, 'It was not wrong for men to go into beer-saloons, only for children. And Cyril is nearer being a man than us, because he is the eldest.' So he went. The others sat in the sun and waited. 'Oh, how hot it is!' said Robert. 'Dogs put their tongues out when they're hot; I wonder if it would cool us at all to put out ours?' 'We might try,' Jane said; and they all put their tongues out as far as ever they could go, so that it quite stretched their throats, but it only seemed to make them thirstier than ever, besides annoying everyone who went by. So they took their tongues in again, just as Cyril came back with ginger-beer. 'I had to pay for it out of my own money, though, that I was going to buy rabbits with,' he said. 'They wouldn't change the gold. And when I pulled out a handful the man just laughed and said it was card-counters. And I got some sponge-cakes too, out of a glass jar on the bar-counter. And some biscuits with caraways in.' The sponge-cakes were both soft and dry and the biscuits were dry too, and yet soft, which biscuits ought not to be. But the ginger-beer made up for everything. 'It's my turn now to try to buy something with the money,' Anthea said; 'I'm next eldest. Where is the pony-cart kept?' It was at The Chequers, and Anthea went in the back way to the yard, because they all knew that little girls ought not to go into the bars of beer-saloons. She came out, as she herself said, 'pleased but not proud.' 'He'll be ready in a brace of shakes, he says,' she remarked, 'and he's to have one sovereign, or whatever it is, to drive us into Rochester and back, besides waiting there till we've got everything we want. I think I managed very well.' 'You think yourself jolly clever, I daresay,' said Cyril moodily. 'How did you do it?' 'I wasn't jolly clever enough to go taking handfuls of money out of my pocket, to make it seem cheap, anyway,' she retorted. 'I just found a young man doing something to a horse's legs with a sponge and a pail. And I held out one sovereign, and I said, 'Do you know what this is?' He said 'No,' and he'd call his father. And the old man came, and he said it was a spade guinea; and he said was it my own to do as I liked with, and I said 'Yes'; and I asked about the pony-cart, and I said he could have the guinea if he'd drive us into Rochester. And his name is S. Crispin. And he said, 'Right oh.'' It was a new sensation to be driven in a smart pony-trap along pretty country roads; it was very pleasant too (which is not always the case with new sensations), quite apart from the beautiful plans of spending the money which each child made as they went along, silently of course and quite to itself, for they felt it would never have done to let the old innkeeper hear them talk in the affluent sort of way in which they were thinking. The old man put them down by the bridge at their request. 'If you were going to buy a carriage and horses, where would you go?' asked Cyril, as if he were only asking for the sake of something to say. 'Billy Peasemarsh, at the Saracen's Head,' said the old man promptly. 'Though all forbid I should recommend any man where it's a question of horses, no more than I'd take anybody else's recommending if I was a-buying one. But if your pa's thinking of a rig of any sort, there ain't a straighter man in Rochester, nor civiller spoken, than Billy, though I says it.' 'Thank you,' said Cyril. 'The Saracen's Head.' And now the children began to see one of the laws of nature turn upside down and stand on its head like an acrobat. Any grown-up person would tell you that money is hard to get and easy to spend. But the fairy money had been easy to get, and spending it was not only hard, it was almost impossible. The trades-people of Rochester seemed to shrink, to a trades-person, from the glittering fairy gold ('furrin money' they called it, for the most part). To begin with, Anthea, who had had the misfortune to sit on her hat earlier in the day, wished to buy another. She chose a very beautiful one, trimmed with pink roses and the blue breasts of peacocks. It was marked in the window, 'Paris Model, three guineas.' 'I'm glad,' she said, 'because it says guineas, and not sovereigns, which we haven't got.' But when she took three of the spade guineas in her hand, which was by this time rather dirty owing to her not having put on gloves before going to the gravel-pit, the black-silk young lady in the shop looked very hard at her, and went and whispered something to an older and uglier lady, also in black silk, and then they gave her back the money and said it was not current coin. 'It's good money,' said Anthea, 'and it's my own.' 'I daresay,' said the lady, 'but it's not the kind of money that's fashionable now, and we don't care about taking it.' 'I believe they think we've stolen it,' said Anthea, rejoining the others in the street; 'if we had gloves they wouldn't think we were so dishonest. It's my hands being so dirty fills their minds with doubts.' So they chose a humble shop, and the girls bought cotton gloves, the kind at a shilling, but when they offered a guinea the woman looked at it through her spectacles and said she had no change; so the gloves had to be paid for out of Cyril's money with which he meant to buy rabbits and so had the green imitation crocodile-skin purse at nine-pence which had been bought at the same time. They tried several more shops, the kinds where you buy toys and perfume and silk handkerchiefs and books, and fancy boxes of stationery, and photographs of objects of interest in the vicinity. But nobody cared to change a guinea that day in Rochester, and as they went from shop to shop they got dirtier and dirtier, and their hair got more and more untidy, and Jane slipped and fell down on a part of the road where a water cart had just gone by. Also they got very hungry, but they found no one would give them anything to eat for their guineas. After trying two baker shops in vain, they became so hungry, perhaps from the smell of the cake in the shops, as Cyril suggested, that they formed a plan of campaign in whispers and carried it out in desperation. They marched into a third baker shop,, Beale was his name,, and before the people behind the counter could interfere each child had seized three new penny buns, clapped the three together between its dirty hands, and taken a big bite out of the triple sandwich. Then they stood at bay, with the twelve buns in their hands and their mouths very full indeed. The shocked baker's man bounded round the corner. 'Here,' said Cyril, speaking as distinctly as he could, and holding out the guinea he got ready before entering the shops, 'pay yourself out of that.' Mr. Beale snatched the coin, bit it, and put it in his pocket. [Illustration: Mr. Beale snatched the coin, bit it, and put it in his pocket] 'Off you go,' he said, brief and stern like the man in the song. 'But the change?' said Anthea, who had a saving mind. 'Change!' said the man, 'I'll change you! Hout you goes; and you may think yourselves lucky I don't send for the police to find out where you got it!' In the Gardens of the Castle the millionaires finished the buns, and though the curranty softness of these were delicious, and acted like a charm in raising the spirits of the party, yet even the stoutest heart quailed at the thought of venturing to sound Mr. Billy Peasemarsh at the Saracen's Head on the subject of a horse and carriage. The boys would have given up the idea, but Jane was always a hopeful child, and Anthea generally an obstinate one, and their earnestness prevailed. The whole party, by this time indescribably dirty, therefore betook itself to the Saracen's Head. The yard-method of attack having been successful at The Chequers, was tried again here. Mr. Peasemarsh was in the yard, and Robert opened the business in these terms,  'They tell me you have a lot of horses and carriages to sell.' It had been agreed that Robert should be spokesman, because in books it is always gentlemen who buy horses, and not ladies, and Cyril had had his go at the Blue Boar. 'They tell you true, young man,' said Mr. Peasemarsh. He was a long lean man, with very blue eyes and a tight mouth and narrow lips. 'We should like to buy some, please,' said Robert politely. 'I daresay you would.' 'Will you show us a few, please? To choose from.' 'Who are you a-kiddin of?' inquired Mr. Billy Peasemarsh. 'Was you sent here of a message?' 'I tell you,' said Robert, 'we want to buy some horses and carriages, and a man told us you were straight and civil spoken, but I shouldn't wonder if he was mistaken',  'Upon my sacred!' said Mr. Peasemarsh. 'Shall I trot the whole stable out for your Honor's worship to see? Or shall I send round to the Bishop's to see if he's a nag or two to dispose of?' 'Please do,' said Robert, 'if it's not too much trouble. It would be very kind of you.' Mr. Peasemarsh put his hands in his pockets and laughed, and they did not like the way he did it. Then he shouted 'Willum!' A stooping ostler appeared in a stable door. 'Here, Willum, come and look at this 'ere young dook! Wants to buy the whole stud, lock, stock, and bar'l. And ain't got tuppence in his pocket to bless hisself with, I'll go bail!' Willum's eyes followed his master's pointing thumb with contemptuous interest. 'Do 'e, for sure?' he said. But Robert spoke, though both the girls were now pulling at his jacket and begging him to 'come along.' He spoke, and he was very angry; he said,  'I'm not a young duke, and I never pretended to be. And as for tuppence, what do you call this?' And before the others could stop him he had pulled out two fat handfuls of shining guineas, and held them out for Mr. Peasemarsh to look at. He did look. He snatched one up in his finger and thumb. He bit it, and Jane expected him to say, 'The best horse in my stables is at your service.' But the others knew better. Still it was a blow, even to the most desponding, when he said shortly,  'Willum, shut the yard doors;' and Willum grinned and went to shut them. 'Good-afternoon,' said Robert hastily; 'we shan't buy any horses now, whatever you say, and I hope it'll be a lesson to you.' He had seen a little side gate open, and was moving towards it as he spoke. But Billy Peasemarsh put himself in the way. 'Not so fast, you young off-scouring!' he said. 'Willum, fetch the pleece.' Willum went. The children stood huddled together like frightened sheep, and Mr. Peasemarsh spoke to them till the pleece arrived. He said many things. Among other things he said,  'Nice lot you are, aren't you, coming tempting honest men with your guineas!' 'They  are  our guineas,' said Cyril boldly. 'Oh, of course we don't know all about that, no more we don't, oh no, course not! And dragging little gells into it, too. 'Ere, I'll let the gells go if you'll come along to the pleece quiet.' 'We won't be let go,' said Jane heroically; 'not without the boys. It's our money just as much as theirs, you wicked old man.' 'Where'd you get it, then?' said the man, softening slightly, which was not at all what the boys expected when Jane began to call names. Jane cast a silent glance of agony at the others. 'Lost your tongue, eh? Got it fast enough when it's for calling names with. Come, speak up! Where'd you get it?' 'Out of the gravel-pit,' said truthful Jane. 'Next article,' said the man. 'I tell you we did,' Jane said. 'There's a fairy there, all over brown fur, with ears like a bat's and eyes like a snail's, and he gives you a wish a day, and they all come true.' 'Touched in the head, eh?' said the man in a low voice; 'all the more shame to you boys dragging the poor afflicted child into your sinful burglaries.' 'She's not mad; it's true,' said Anthea; 'there  is  a fairy. If I ever see him again I'll wish for something for you; at least I would if vengeance wasn't wicked, so there!' 'Lor' lumme,' said Billy Peasemarsh, 'if there ain't another on 'em!' And now Willum came back, with a spiteful grin on his face, and at his back a policeman, with whom Mr. Peasemarsh spoke long in a hoarse earnest whisper. 'I daresay you're right,' said the policeman at last. 'Anyway, I'll take 'em up on a charge of unlawful possession, pending inquiries. And the magistrate will deal with the case. Send the afflicted ones to a home, as likely as not, and the boys to a reformatory. Now then, come along, youngsters! No use making a fuss. You bring the gells along, Mr. Peasemarsh, sir, and I'll shepherd the boys.' Speechless with rage and horror, the four children were driven along the streets of Rochester. Tears of anger and shame blinded them, so that when Robert ran right into a passer-by he did not recognise her till a well-known voice said, 'Well, if ever I did! Oh, Master Robert, whatever have you been a-doing of now?' And another voice, quite as well known, said, 'Panty; want go own Panty!' They had run into Martha and the Baby! [Illustration: They had run into Martha and the baby] Martha behaved admirably. She refused to believe a word of the policeman's story, or of Mr. Peasemarsh's either, even when they made Robert turn out his pockets in an archway and show the guineas. 'I don't see nothing,' she said. 'You've gone out of your senses, you two! There ain't any gold there, only the poor child's hands, all over dirt, and like the very chimbley. Oh that I should ever see the day!' And the children thought this very noble of Martha, even if rather wicked, till they remembered how the Fairy had promised that the servants should never notice any of the fairy gifts. So of course Martha couldn't see the gold, and so was only speaking the truth, and that was quite right, of course, but not extra noble. It was getting dusk when they reached the police-station. The policeman told his tale to an inspector, who sat in a large bare room with a thing like a clumsy nursery-fender at one end to put prisoners in. Robert wondered whether it was a cell or a dock. 'Produce the coins, officer,' said the inspector. 'Turn out your pockets,' said the constable. Cyril desperately plunged his hands in his pockets, stood still a moment, and then began to laugh, an odd sort of laugh that hurt, and that felt much more like crying. His pockets were empty. So were the pockets of the others. For of course at sunset all the fairy gold had vanished away. 'Turn out your pockets, and stop that noise,' said the inspector. Cyril turned out his pockets, every one of the nine which enriched his suit. And every pocket was empty. 'Well!' said the inspector. 'I don't know how they done it, artful little beggars! They walked in front of me the 'ole way, so as for me to keep my eye on them and not to attract a crowd and obstruct the traffic.' 'It's very remarkable,' said the inspector, frowning. 'If you've done a-browbeating of the innocent children,' said Martha, 'I'll hire a private carriage and we'll drive home to their papa's mansion. You'll hear about this again, young man!, I told you they hadn't got any gold, when you were pretending to see it in their poor helpless hands. It's early in the day for a constable on duty not to be able to trust his own eyes. As to the other one, the less said the better; he keeps the Saracen's Head, and he knows best what his liquor's like.' [Illustration: He said, 'Now then!' to the policeman and Mr. Peasemarsh] 'Take them away, for goodness' sake,' said the inspector crossly. But as they left the police-station he said, 'Now then!' to the policeman and Mr. Peasemarsh, and he said it twenty times as crossly as he had spoken to Martha.                                          Martha was as good as her word. She took them home in a very grand carriage, because the carrier's cart was gone, and, though she had stood by them so nobly with the police, she was so angry with them as soon as they were alone for 'trapesing into Rochester by themselves,' that none of them dared to mention the old man with the pony-cart from the village who was waiting for them in Rochester. And so, after one day of boundless wealth, the children found themselves sent to bed in deep disgrace, and only enriched by two pairs of cotton gloves, dirty inside because of the state of the hands they had been put on to cover, an imitation crocodile-skin purse, and twelve penny buns, long since digested. The thing that troubled them most was the fear that the old gentleman's guinea might have disappeared at sunset with all the rest, so they went down to the village next day to apologise for not meeting him in Rochester, and to  see . They found him very friendly. The guinea had not disappeared, and he had bored a hole in it and hung it on his watch-chain. As for the guinea the baker took, the children felt they  could  not care whether it had vanished or not, which was not perhaps very honest, but on the other hand was not wholly unnatural. But afterwards this preyed on Anthea's mind, and at last she secretly sent twelve postage stamps by post to 'Mr. Beale, Baker, Rochester.' Inside she wrote, 'To pay for the buns.' I hope the guinea did disappear, for that baker was really not at all a nice man, and, besides, penny buns are seven for sixpence in all really respectable shops. CHAPTER III BEING WANTED The morning after the children had been the possessors of boundless wealth, and had been unable to buy anything really useful or enjoyable with it, except two pairs of cotton gloves, twelve penny buns, an imitation crocodile-skin purse, and a ride in a pony-cart, they awoke without any of the enthusiastic happiness which they had felt on the previous day when they remembered how they had had the luck to find a Psammead, or Sand-fairy, and to receive its promise to grant them a new wish every day. For now they had had two wishes, Beauty and Wealth, and neither had exactly made them happy. But the happening of strange things, even if they are not completely pleasant things, is more amusing than those times when nothing happens but meals, and they are not always completely pleasant, especially on the days when it is cold mutton or hash. There was no chance of talking things over before breakfast, because everyone overslept itself, as it happened, and it needed a vigorous and determined struggle to get dressed so as to be only ten minutes late for breakfast. During this meal some efforts were made to deal with the question of the Psammead in an impartial spirit, but it is very difficult to discuss anything thoroughly and at the same time to attend faithfully to your baby brother's breakfast needs. The Baby was particularly lively that morning. He not only wriggled his body through the bar of his high chair, and hung by his head, choking and purple, but he seized a tablespoon with desperate suddenness, hit Cyril heavily on the head with it, and then cried because it was taken away from him. He put his fat fist in his bread-and-milk, and demanded 'nam,' which was only allowed for tea. He sang, he put his feet on the table, he clamoured to 'go walky.' The conversation was something like this,  'Look here, about that Sand-fairy, ,  Look out!, he'll have the milk over.' Milk removed to a safe distance. 'Yes, about that Fairy, ,  No, Lamb dear, give Panther the narky poon.' Then Cyril tried. 'Nothing we've had yet has turned out, ,  He nearly had the mustard that time!' 'I wonder whether we'd better wish, ,  Hullo!, you've done it now, my boy!' And in a flash of glass and pink baby-paws, the bowl of golden carp in the middle of the table rolled on its side and poured a flood of mixed water and gold-fish into the Baby's lap and into the laps of the others. Everyone was almost as much upset as the gold-fish; the Lamb only remaining calm. When the pool on the floor had been mopped up, and the leaping, gasping gold-fish had been collected and put back in the water, the Baby was taken away to be entirely re-dressed by Martha, and most of the others had to change completely. The pinafores and jackets that had been bathed in gold-fish-and-water were hung out to dry, and then it turned out that Jane must either mend the dress she had torn the day before or appear all day in her best petticoat. It was white and soft and frilly, and trimmed with lace, and very, very pretty, quite as pretty as a frock, if not more so. Only it was  not  a frock, and Martha's word was law. She wouldn't let Jane wear her best frock, and she refused to listen for a moment to Robert's suggestion that Jane should wear her best petticoat and call it a dress. 'It's not respectable,' she said. And when people say that, it's no use anyone's saying anything. You'll find this out for yourselves some day. So there was nothing for it but for Jane to mend her frock. The hole had been torn the day before when she happened to tumble down in the High Street of Rochester, just where a water-cart had passed on its silvery way. She had grazed her knee, and her stocking was much more than grazed, and her dress was cut by the same stone which had attended to the knee and the stocking. Of course the others were not such sneaks as to abandon a comrade in misfortune, so they all sat on the grass-plot round the sun-dial, and Jane darned away for dear life. The Lamb was still in the hands of Martha having its clothes changed, so conversation was possible. Anthea and Robert timidly tried to conceal their inmost thought, which was that the Psammead was not to be trusted; but Cyril said,  'Speak out, say what you've got to say, I hate hinting, and 'don't know,' and sneakish ways like that.' So then Robert said, as in honour bound, 'Sneak yourself, Anthea and me weren't so gold-fishy as you two were, so we got changed quicker, and we've had time to think it over, and if you ask me',  'I didn't ask you,' said Jane, biting off a needleful of thread as she had always been strictly forbidden to do. (Perhaps you don't know that if you bite off ends of cotton and swallow them they wind tight round your heart and kill you? My nurse told me this, and she told me also about the earth going round the sun. Now what is one to believe, what with nurses and science?) 'I don't care who asks or who doesn't,' said Robert, 'but Anthea and I think the Sammyadd is a spiteful brute. If it can give us our wishes I suppose it can give itself its own, and I feel almost sure it wishes every time that our wishes shan't do us any good. Let's let the tiresome beast alone, and just go and have a jolly good game of forts, on our own, in the chalk-pit.' (You will remember that the happily-situated house where these children were spending their holidays lay between a chalk-quarry and a gravel-pit.) Cyril and Jane were more hopeful, they generally were. 'I don't think the Sammyadd does it on purpose,' Cyril said; 'and, after all, it  was  silly to wish for boundless wealth. Fifty pounds in two-shilling pieces would have been much more sensible. And wishing to be beautiful as the day was simply donkeyish. I don't want to be disagreeable, but it  was . We must try to find a really useful wish, and wish it.' Jane dropped her work and said,  'I think so too, it's too silly to have a chance like this and not use it. I never heard of anyone else outside a book who had such a chance; there must be simply heaps of things we could wish for that wouldn't turn out Dead Sea fish, like these two things have. Do let's think hard and wish something nice, so that we can have a real jolly day, what there is left of it.' Jane darned away again like mad, for time was indeed getting on, and everyone began to talk at once. If you had been there you could not possibly have made head or tail of the talk, but these children were used to talking 'by fours,' as soldiers march, and each of them could say what it had to say quite comfortably, and listen to the agreeable sound of its own voice, and at the same time have three-quarters of two sharp ears to spare for listening to what the others said. That is an easy example in multiplication of vulgar fractions, but, as I daresay you can't do even that, I won't ask you to tell me whether 3/4 × 2 = 1-1/2, but I will ask you to believe me that this was the amount of ear each child was able to lend to the others. Lending ears was common in Roman times, as we learn from Shakespeare; but I fear I am getting too instructive. When the frock was darned, the start for the gravel-pit was delayed by Martha's insisting on everybody's washing its hands, which was nonsense, because nobody had been doing anything at all, except Jane, and how can you get dirty doing nothing? That is a difficult question, and I cannot answer it on paper. In real life I could very soon show you, or you me, which is much more likely. During the conversation in which the six ears were lent (there were four children, so  that  sum comes right), it had been decided that fifty pounds in two-shilling pieces was the right wish to have. And the lucky children, who could have anything in the wide world by just wishing for it, hurriedly started for the gravel-pit to express their wishes to the Psammead. Martha caught them at the gate, and insisted on their taking the Baby with them. [Illustration: The lucky children ... hurriedly started for the gravel pit] 'Not want him indeed! Why, everybody 'ud want him, a duck! with all their hearts they would; and you know you promised your ma to take him out every blessed day,' said Martha. 'I know we did,' said Robert in gloom, 'but I wish the Lamb wasn't quite so young and small. It would be much better fun taking him out.' 'He'll mend of his youngness with time,' said Martha; 'and as for smallness, I don't think you'd fancy carrying of him any more, however big he was. Besides he can walk a bit, bless his precious fat legs, a ducky! He feels the benefit of the new-laid air, so he does, a pet!' With this and a kiss, she plumped the Lamb into Anthea's arms, and went back to make new pinafores on the sewing-machine. She was a rapid performer on this instrument. The Lamb laughed with pleasure, and said, 'Walky wif Panty,' and rode on Robert's back with yells of joy, and tried to feed Jane with stones, and altogether made himself so agreeable that nobody could long be sorry that he was of the party. The enthusiastic Jane even suggested that they should devote a week's wishes to assuring the Baby's future, by asking such gifts for him as the good fairies give to Infant Princes in proper fairy-tales, but Anthea soberly reminded her that as the Sand-fairy's wishes only lasted till sunset they could not ensure any benefit to the Baby's later years; and Jane owned that it would be better to wish for fifty pounds in two-shilling pieces, and buy the Lamb a three-pound fifteen rocking-horse, like those in the big stores, with a part of the money. It was settled that, as soon as they had wished for the money and got it, they would get Mr. Crispin to drive them into Rochester again, taking Martha with them if they could not get out of taking her. And they would make a list of things they really wanted before they started. Full of high hopes and excellent resolutions, they went round the safe slow cart-road to the gravel-pits, and as they went in between the mounds of gravel a sudden thought came to them, and would have turned their ruddy cheeks pale if they had been children in a book. Being real live children, it only made them stop and look at each other with rather blank and silly expressions. For now they remembered that yesterday, when they had asked the Psammead for boundless wealth, and it was getting ready to fill the quarry with the minted gold of bright guineas, millions of them, it had told the children to run along outside the quarry for fear they should be buried alive in the heavy splendid treasure. And they had run. And so it happened that they had not had time to mark the spot where the Psammead was, with a ring of stones, as before. And it was this thought that put such silly expressions on their faces. 'Never mind,' said the hopeful Jane, 'we'll soon find him.' But this, though easily said, was hard in the doing. They looked and they looked, and, though they found their seaside spades, nowhere could they find the Sand-fairy. At last they had to sit down and rest, not at all because they were weary or disheartened, of course, but because the Lamb insisted on being put down, and you cannot look very carefully after anything you may have happened to lose in the sand if you have an active baby to look after at the same time. Get someone to drop your best knife in the sand next time you go to the seashore and then take your baby brother with you when you go to look for it, and you will see that I am right. The Lamb, as Martha had said, was feeling the benefit of the country air, and he was as frisky as a sandhopper. The elder ones longed to go on talking about the new wishes they would have when (or if) they found the Psammead again. But the Lamb wished to enjoy himself. He watched his opportunity and threw a handful of sand into Anthea's face, and then suddenly burrowed his own head in the sand and waved his fat legs in the air. Then of course the sand got into his eyes, as it had into Anthea's, and he howled. The thoughtful Robert had brought one solid brown bottle of ginger-beer with him, relying on a thirst that had never yet failed him. This had to be uncorked hurriedly, it was the only wet thing within reach, and it was necessary to wash the sand out of the Lamb's eyes somehow. Of course the ginger hurt horribly, and he howled more than ever. And, amid his anguish of kicking, the bottle was upset and the beautiful ginger-beer frothed out into the sand and was lost for ever. It was then that Robert, usually a very patient brother, so far forgot himself as to say,  'Anybody would want him, indeed! Only they don't; Martha doesn't, not really, or she'd jolly well keep him with her. He's a little nuisance, that's what he is. It's too bad. I only wish everybody  did  want him with all their hearts; we might get some peace in our lives.' The Lamb stopped howling now, because Jane had suddenly remembered that there is only one safe way of taking things out of little children's eyes, and that is with your own soft wet tongue. It is quite easy if you love the Baby as much as you ought to do. Then there was a little silence. Robert was not proud of himself for having been so cross, and the others were not proud of him either. You often notice that sort of silence when someone has said something it ought not to, and everyone else holds its tongue and waits for the one who oughtn't to have said it is sorry. The silence was broken by a sigh, a breath suddenly let out. The children's heads turned as if there had been a string tied to each nose, and somebody had pulled all the strings at once. And everyone saw the Sand-fairy sitting quite close to them, with the expression which it used as a smile on its hairy face. 'Good-morning,' it said; 'I did that quite easily! Everyone wants him now.' 'It doesn't matter,' said Robert sulkily, because he knew he had been behaving rather like a pig. 'No matter who wants him, there's no one here to, anyhow.' 'Ingratitude,' said the Psammead, 'is a dreadful vice.' 'We're not ungrateful,' Jane made haste to say, 'but we didn't  really  want that wish. Robert only just said it. Can't you take it back and give us a new one?' 'No, I can't,' the Sand-fairy said shortly; 'chopping and changing, it's not business. You ought to be careful what you  do  wish. There was a little boy once, he'd wished for a Plesiosaurus instead of an Ichthyosaurus, because he was too lazy to remember the easy names of everyday things, and his father had been very vexed with him, and had made him go to bed before tea-time, and wouldn't let him go out in the nice flint boat along with the other children,, it was the annual school-treat next day,, and he came and flung himself down near me on the morning of the treat, and he kicked his little prehistoric legs about and said he wished he was dead. And of course then he was.' 'How awful! said the children all together. 'Only till sunset, of course,' the Psammead said; 'still it was quite enough for his father and mother. And he caught it when he woke up, I tell you. He didn't turn to stone, I forget why, but there must have been some reason. They didn't know being dead is only being asleep, and you're bound to wake up somewhere or other, either where you go to sleep or in some better place. You may be sure he caught it, giving them such a turn. Why, he wasn't allowed to taste Megatherium for a month after that. Nothing but oysters and periwinkles, and common things like that.' All the children were quite crushed by this terrible tale. They looked at the Psammead in horror. Suddenly the Lamb perceived that something brown and furry was near him. 'Poof, poof, poofy,' he said, and made a grab. [Illustration: 'Poof, poof, poofy,' he said, and made a grab] 'It's not a pussy,' Anthea was beginning, when the Sand-fairy leaped back. 'Oh, my left whisker!' it said; 'don't let him touch me. He's wet.' Its fur stood on end with horror, and indeed a good deal of the ginger-beer had been spilt on the blue smock of the Lamb. The Psammead dug with its hands and feet, and vanished in an instant and a whirl of sand. The children marked the spot with a ring of stones. 'We may as well get along home,' said Robert. 'I'll say I'm sorry; but anyway if it's no good it's no harm, and we know where the sandy thing is for to-morrow.' The others were noble. No one reproached Robert at all. Cyril picked up the Lamb, who was now quite himself again, and off they went by the safe cart-road. The cart-road from the gravel-pits joins the road almost directly. At the gate into the road the party stopped to shift the Lamb from Cyril's back to Robert's. And as they paused a very smart open carriage came in sight, with a coachman and a groom on the box, and inside the carriage a lady, very grand indeed, with a dress all white lace and red ribbons and a parasol all red and white, and a white fluffy dog on her lap with a red ribbon round its neck. She looked at the children, and particularly at the Baby, and she smiled at him. The children were used to this, for the Lamb was, as all the servants said, a 'very taking child.' So they waved their hands politely to the lady and expected her to drive on. But she did not. Instead she made the coachman stop. And she beckoned to Cyril, and when he went up to the carriage she said,  'What a dear darling duck of a baby! Oh, I  should  so like to adopt it! Do you think its mother would mind?' 'She'd mind very much indeed,' said Anthea shortly. 'Oh, but I should bring it up in luxury, you know. I am Lady Chittenden. You must have seen my photograph in the illustrated papers. They call me a Beauty, you know, but of course that's all nonsense. Anyway',  She opened the carriage door and jumped out. She had the wonderfullest red high-heeled shoes with silver buckles. 'Let me hold him a minute,' she said. And she took the Lamb and held him very awkwardly, as if she was not used to babies. Then suddenly she jumped into the carriage with the Lamb in her arms and slammed the door, and said, 'Drive on!' The Lamb roared, the little white dog barked, and the coachman hesitated. 'Drive on, I tell you!' cried the lady; and the coachman did, for, as he said afterwards, it was as much as his place was worth not to. The four children looked at each other, and then with one accord they rushed after the carriage and held on behind. Down the dusty road went the smart carriage, and after it, at double-quick time, ran the twinkling legs of the Lamb's brothers and sisters. [Illustration: At double-quick time, ran the twinkling legs of the Lamb's brothers and sisters] The Lamb howled louder and louder, but presently his howls changed by slow degrees to hiccupy gurgles, and then all was still, and they knew he had gone to sleep. The carriage went on, and the eight feet that twinkled through the dust were growing quite stiff and tired before the carriage stopped at the lodge of a grand park. The children crouched down behind the carriage, and the lady got out. She looked at the Baby as it lay on the carriage seat, and hesitated. 'The darling, I won't disturb it,' she said, and went into the lodge to talk to the woman there about a setting of eggs that had not turned out well. The coachman and footman sprang from the box and bent over the sleeping Lamb. 'Fine boy, wish he was mine,' said the coachman. 'He wouldn't favour  you  much,' said the groom sourly; 'too 'andsome.' The coachman pretended not to hear. He said,  'Wonder at her now, I do really! Hates kids. Got none of her own, and can't abide other folkses'.' The children, crouched in the white dust under the carriage, exchanged uncomfortable glances. 'Tell you what,' the coachman went on firmly, 'blowed if I don't hide the little nipper in the hedge and tell her his brothers took 'im! Then I'll come back for him afterwards.' 'No, you don't,' said the footman. 'I've took to that kid so as never was. If anyone's to have him, it's me, so there!' 'Stop your talk!' the coachman rejoined. 'You don't want no kids, and, if you did, one kid's the same as another to you. But I'm a married man and a judge of breed. I knows a firstrate yearling when I sees him. I'm a-goin' to 'ave him, an' least said soonest mended.' 'I should 'a' thought,' said the footman sneeringly, 'you'd a'most enough. What with Alfred, an' Albert, an' Louise, an' Victor Stanley, and Helena Beatrice, and another',  The coachman hit the footman in the chin, the footman hit the coachman in the waist-coat, the next minute the two were fighting here and there, in and out, up and down, and all over everywhere, and the little dog jumped on the box of the carriage and began barking like mad. [Illustration: The next minute the two were fighting] Cyril, still crouching in the dust, waddled on bent legs to the side of the carriage farthest from the battlefield. He unfastened the door of the carriage, the two men were far too much occupied with their quarrel to notice anything, took the Lamb in his arms, and, still stooping, carried the sleeping baby a dozen yards along the road to where a stile led into a wood. The others followed, and there among the hazels and young oaks and sweet chestnuts, covered by high strong-scented brake-fern, they all lay hidden till the angry voices of the men were hushed at the angry voice of the red-and-white lady, and, after a long and anxious search, the carriage at last drove away. 'My only hat!' said Cyril, drawing a deep breath as the sound of wheels at last died away. 'Everyone  does  want him now, and no mistake! That Sammyadd has done us again! Tricky brute! For any sake, let's get the kid safe home.' So they peeped out, and finding on the right hand only lonely white road, and nothing but lonely white road on the left, they took courage, and the road, Anthea carrying the sleeping Lamb. Adventures dogged their footsteps. A boy with a bundle of faggots on his back dropped his bundle by the roadside and asked to look at the Baby, and then offered to carry him; but Anthea was not to be caught that way twice. They all walked on, but the boy followed, and Cyril and Robert couldn't make him go away till they had more than once invited him to smell their fists. Afterwards a little girl in a blue-and-white checked pinafore actually followed them for a quarter of a mile crying for 'the precious Baby,' and then she was only got rid of by threats of tying her to a tree in the wood with all their pocket handkerchiefs. 'So that bears can come and eat you as soon as it gets dark,' said Cyril severely. Then she went off crying. It presently seemed wise, to the brothers and sisters of the Baby who was wanted by everyone, to hide in the hedge whenever they saw anyone coming, and thus they managed to prevent the Lamb from arousing the inconvenient affection of a milkman, a stone-breaker, and a man who drove a cart with a paraffin barrel at the back of it. They were nearly home when the worst thing of all happened. Turning a corner suddenly they came upon two vans, a tent, and a company of gipsies encamped by the side of the road. The vans were hung all round with wicker chairs and cradles, and flower-stands and feather brushes. A lot of ragged children were industriously making dust-pies in the road, two men lay on the grass smoking, and three women were doing the family washing in an old red watering-can with the top broken off. In a moment every gipsy, men, women, and children, surrounded Anthea and the Baby. 'Let me hold him, little lady,' said one of the gipsy women, who had a mahogany-coloured face and dust-coloured hair; 'I won't hurt a hair of his head, the little picture!' 'I'd rather not,' said Anthea. 'Let  me  have him,' said the other woman, whose face was also of the hue of mahogany, and her hair jet-black, in greasy curls. 'I've nineteen of my own, so I have',  'No,' said Anthea bravely, but her heart beat so that it nearly choked her. Then one of the men pushed forward. 'Swelp me if it ain't!' he cried, 'my own long-lost cheild! Have he a strawberry mark on his left ear? No? Then he's my own babby, stolen from me in hinnocent hinfancy. 'And 'im over, and we'll not 'ave the law on yer this time.' He snatched the Baby from Anthea, who turned scarlet and burst into tears of pure rage. [Illustration: He snatched the baby from Anthea] The others were standing quite still; this was much the most terrible thing that had ever happened to them. Even being taken up by the police in Rochester was nothing to this. Cyril was quite white, and his hands trembled a little, but he made a sign to the others to shut up. He was silent a minute, thinking hard. Then he said,  'We don't want to keep him if he's yours. But you see he's used to us. You shall have him if you want him',  'No, no!' cried Anthea,, and Cyril glared at her. 'Of course we want him,' said the women, trying to get the Baby out of the man's arms. The Lamb howled loudly. 'Oh, he's hurt!' shrieked Anthea; and Cyril, in a savage undertone, bade her 'stop it!' 'You trust to me,' he whispered. 'Look here,' he went on, 'he's awfully tiresome with people he doesn't know very well. Suppose we stay here a bit till he gets used to you, and then when it's bedtime I give you my word of honour we'll go away and let you keep him if you want to. And then when we're gone you can decide which of you is to have him, as you all want him so much.' 'That's fair enough,' said the man who was holding the Baby, trying to loosen the red neckerchief which the Lamb had caught hold of and drawn round his mahogany throat so tight that he could hardly breathe. The gipsies whispered together, and Cyril took the chance to whisper too. He said, 'Sunset! we'll get away then.' And then his brothers and sisters were filled with wonder and admiration at his having been so clever as to remember this. 'Oh, do let him come to us!' said Jane. 'See, we'll sit down here and take care of him for you till he gets used to you.' 'What about dinner?' said Robert suddenly. The others looked at him with scorn. 'Fancy bothering about your beastly dinner when your br, I mean when the Baby', Jane whispered hotly. Robert carefully winked at her and went on,  'You won't mind my just running home to get our dinner?' he said to the gipsy; 'I can bring it out here in a basket.' His brothers and sisters felt themselves very noble and despised him. They did not know his thoughtful secret intention. But the gipsies did in a minute. 'Oh yes!' they said; 'and then fetch the police with a pack of lies about it being your baby instead of ours! D'jever catch a weasel asleep?' they asked. 'If you're hungry you can pick a bit along of us,' said the light-haired gipsy-woman, not unkindly. 'Here Levi, that blessed kid'll howl all his buttons off. Give him to the little lady, and let's see if they can't get him used to us a bit.' So the Lamb was handed back; but the gipsies crowded so closely that he could not possibly stop howling. Then the man with the red handkerchief said,  'Here, Pharaoh, make up the fire; and you girls see to the pot. Give the kid a chanst.' So the gipsies, very much against their will, went off to their work, and the children and the Lamb were left sitting on the grass. 'He'll be all right at sunset,' Jane whispered. 'But, oh, it is awful! Suppose they are frightfully angry when they come to their senses! They might beat us, or leave us tied to trees, or something.' 'No, they won't,' Anthea said ('Oh, my Lamb, don't cry any more, it's all right, Panty's got oo, duckie'); 'they aren't unkind people, or they wouldn't be going to give us any dinner.' 'Dinner?' said Robert; 'I won't touch their nasty dinner. It would choke me!' The others thought so too then. But when the dinner was ready, it turned out to be supper, and happened between four and five, they were all glad enough to take what they could get. It was boiled rabbit, with onions, and some bird rather like a chicken, but stringier about its legs and with a stronger taste. The Lamb had bread soaked in hot water and brown sugar sprinkled on the top. He liked this very much, and consented to let the two gipsy women feed him with it, as he sat on Anthea's lap. All that long hot afternoon Robert and Cyril and Anthea and Jane had to keep the Lamb amused and happy, while the gipsies looked eagerly on. By the time the shadows grew long and black across the meadows he had really 'taken to' the woman with the light hair, and even consented to kiss his hand to the children, and to stand up and bow, with his hand on his chest, 'like a gentleman', to the two men. The whole gipsy camp was in raptures with him, and his brothers and sisters could not help taking some pleasure in showing off his accomplishments to an audience so interested and enthusiastic. But they longed for sunset. [Illustration: He consented to let the two gypsy women feed him] 'We're getting into the habit of longing for sunset,' Cyril whispered. 'How I do wish we could wish something really sensible, that would be of some use, so that we should be quite sorry when sunset came.' The shadows got longer and longer, and at last there were no separate shadows any more, but one soft glowing shadow over everything; for the sun was out of sight, behind the hill, but he had not really set yet. The people who make the laws about lighting bicycle lamps are the people who decide when the sun sets; she has to do it too, to the minute, or they would know the reason why! But the gipsies were getting impatient. 'Now, young uns,' the red-handkerchief man said, 'it's time you were laying of your heads on your pillowses, so it is! The kid's all right and friendly with us now, so you just hand him over and get home like you said.' The women and children came crowding round the Lamb, arms were held out, fingers snapped invitingly, friendly faces beaming with admiring smiles; but all failed to tempt the loyal Lamb. He clung with arms and legs to Jane, who happened to be holding him, and uttered the gloomiest roar of the whole day. 'It's no good,' the woman said, 'hand the little poppet over, miss. We'll soon quiet him.' And still the sun would not set. 'Tell her about how to put him to bed,' whispered Cyril; 'anything to gain time, and be ready to bolt when the sun really does make up its silly old mind to set.' 'Yes, I'll hand him over in just one minute,' Anthea began, talking very fast,, 'but do let me just tell you he has a warm bath every night and cold in the morning, and he has a crockery rabbit to go into the warm bath with him, and little Samuel saying his prayers in white china on a red cushion for the cold bath; and he hates you to wash his ears, but you must; and if you let the soap get into his eyes, the Lamb',  'Lamb kyes,' said he, he had stopped roaring to listen. The woman laughed. 'As if I hadn't never bath'd a babby!' she said. 'Come, give us a hold of him. Come to 'Melia, my precious',  'G'way, ugsie!' replied the Lamb at once. 'Yes, but,' Anthea went on, 'about his meals; you really  must  let me tell you he has an apple or banana every morning, and bread and milk for breakfast, and an egg for his tea sometimes, and',  'I've brought up ten,' said the black ringleted woman, 'besides the others. Come, miss, 'and 'im over, I can't bear it no longer. I just must give him a hug.' 'We ain't settled yet whose he's to be, Esther,' said one of the men. 'It won't be you, Esther, with seven of 'em at your tail a'ready.' 'I ain't so sure of that,' said Esther's husband. 'And ain't I nobody, to have a say neither?' said the husband of 'Melia. Zillah, the girl, said, 'An' me? I'm a single girl, and no one but 'im to look after, I ought to have him.' 'Hold your tongue!' 'Shut your mouth!' 'Don't you show me no more of your imperence!' Everyone was getting very angry. The dark gipsy faces were frowning and anxious-looking. Suddenly a change swept over them, as if some invisible sponge had wiped away these cross and anxious expressions, and left only a blank. The children saw that the sun really  had  set. But they were afraid to move. And the gipsies were feeling so muddled because of the invisible sponge that had washed all the feelings of the last few hours out of their hearts, that they could not say a word. The children hardly dared to breathe. Suppose the gipsies, when they recovered speech, should be furious to think how silly they had been all day? It was an awkward moment. Suddenly Anthea, greatly daring, held out the Lamb to the red-handkerchief man. 'Here he is!' she said. The man drew back. 'I shouldn't like to deprive you, miss,' he said hoarsely. 'Anyone who likes can have my share of him,' said the other man. 'After all, I've got enough of my own,' said Esther. 'He's a nice little chap, though,' said Amelia. She was the only one who now looked affectionately at the whimpering Lamb. Zillah said, 'If I don't think I must have had a touch of the sun.  I  don't want him.' 'Then shall we take him away?' said Anthea. 'Well, suppose you do,' said Pharaoh heartily, 'and we'll say no more about it!' And with great haste all the gipsies began to be busy about their tents for the night. All but Amelia. She went with the children as far as the bend in the road, and there she said,  'Let me give him a kiss, miss,, I don't know what made us go for to behave so silly. Us gipsies don't steal babies, whatever they may tell you when you're naughty. We've enough of our own, mostly. But I've lost all mine.' She leaned towards the Lamb; and he, looking in her eyes, unexpectedly put up a grubby soft paw and stroked her face. 'Poor, poor!' said the Lamb. And he let the gipsy woman kiss him, and, what is more, he kissed her brown cheek in return, a very nice kiss, as all his kisses are, and not a wet one like some babies give. The gipsy woman moved her finger about on his forehead as if she had been writing something there, and the same with his chest and his hands and his feet; then she said,  'May he be brave, and have the strong head to think with, and the strong heart to love with, and the strong arms to work with, and the strong feet to travel with, and always come safe home to his own.' Then she said something in a strange language no one could understand, and suddenly added,  'Well, I must be saying 'so long', and glad to have made your acquaintance.' And she turned and went back to her home, the tent by the grassy roadside. The children looked after her till she was out of sight. Then Robert said, 'How silly of her! Even sunset didn't put  her  right. What rot she talked!' 'Well,' said Cyril, 'if you ask me, I think it was rather decent of her',  'Decent?' said Anthea; 'it was very nice indeed of her. I think she's a dear',  'She's just too frightfully nice for anything,' said Jane. And they went home, very late for tea and unspeakably late for dinner. Martha scolded, of course. But the Lamb was safe. 'I say, it turned out we wanted the Lamb as much as anyone,' said Robert, later. 'Of course.' 'But do you feel different about it now the sun's set?' ' No ,' said all the others together. 'Then it's lasted over sunset with us.' 'No, it hasn't,' Cyril explained. 'The wish didn't do anything to  us . We always wanted him with all our hearts when we were our proper selves, only we were all pigs this morning; especially you, Robert.' Robert bore this much with a strange calm. 'I certainly  thought  I didn't want him this morning,' said he. 'Perhaps I  was  a pig. But everything looked so different when we thought we were going to lose him.' And that, my dear children, is the moral of this chapter. I did not mean it to have a moral, but morals are nasty forward beings, and will keep putting in their oars where they are not wanted. And since the moral has crept in, quite against my wishes, you might as well think of it next time you feel piggy yourself and want to get rid of any of your brothers and sisters. I hope this doesn't often happen, but I daresay it has happened sometimes, even to you! CHAPTER IV WINGS The next day was very wet, too wet to go out, and far too wet to think of disturbing a Sand-fairy so sensitive to water that he still, after thousands of years, felt the pain of once having his left whisker wetted. It was a long day, and it was not till the afternoon that all the children suddenly decided to write letters to their mother. It was Robert who had the misfortune to upset the ink well, an unusually deep and full one, straight into that part of Anthea's desk where she had long pretended that an arrangement of mucilage and cardboard painted with Indian ink was a secret drawer. It was not exactly Robert's fault; it was only his misfortune that he chanced to be lifting the ink across the desk just at the moment when Anthea had got it open, and that that same moment should have been the one chosen by the Lamb to get under the table and break his squeaking bird. There was a sharp convenient wire inside the bird, and of course the Lamb ran the wire into Robert's leg at once; and so, without anyone's meaning to do it the secret drawer was flooded with ink. At the same time a stream was poured over Anthea's half-finished letter. So that her letter was something like this,            'DARLING MOTHER,, I hope you are quite well, and I           hope Granny is better. The other day we....' Then came a flood of ink, and at the bottom these words in pencil,            'It was not me upset the ink, but it took such a           time clearing up, so no more as it is           post-time., From your loving daughter     'ANTHEA.' Robert's letter had not even been begun. He had been drawing a ship on the blotting paper while he was trying to think of what to say. And of course after the ink was upset he had to help Anthea to clean out her desk, and he promised to make her another secret drawer, better than the other. And she said, 'Well, make it now.' So it was post-time and his letter wasn't done. And the secret drawer wasn't done either. Cyril wrote a long letter, very fast, and then went to set a trap for slugs that he had read about in the  Home-made Gardener , and when it was post-time the letter could not be found, and it was never found. Perhaps the slugs ate it. Jane's letter was the only one that went. She meant to tell her mother all about the Psammead,, in fact they had all meant to do this,, but she spent so long thinking how to spell the word that there was no time to tell the story properly, and it is useless to tell a story unless you  do  tell it properly, so she had to be contented with this,            'MY DEAR MOTHER DEAR,, We are all as good as we           can, like you told us to, and the Lamb has a           little cold, but Martha says it is nothing, only           he upset the gold-fish into himself yesterday           morning. When we were up at the sand-pit the other           day we went round by the safe way where carts go,           and we found  a',  Half an hour went by before Jane felt quite sure that they could none of them spell Psammead. And they could not find it in the dictionary either, though they looked. Then Jane hastily finished her letter,            'We found a strange thing, but it is nearly           post-time, so no more at present from your little           girl,                                                    'JANE.           'P.S., If you could have a wish come true what           would you have?' Then the postman was heard blowing his horn, and Robert rushed out in the rain to stop his cart and give him the letters. And that was how it happened that, though all the children meant to tell their mother about the Sand-fairy, somehow or other she never got to know. There were other reasons why she never got to know, but these come later. The next day Uncle Richard came and took them all to Maidstone in a wagonette, all except the Lamb. Uncle Richard was the very best kind of uncle. He bought them toys at Maidstone. He took them into a shop and let them all choose exactly what they wanted, without any restrictions about price, and no nonsense about things being instructive. It is very wise to let children choose exactly what they like, because they are very foolish and inexperienced, and sometimes they will choose a really instructive thing without meaning to do so. This happened to Robert, who chose, at the last moment, and in a great hurry, a box with pictures on it of winged bulls with men's heads and winged men with eagles' heads. He thought there would be animals inside, the same as on the box. When he got it home it was a Sunday puzzle about ancient Nineveh! The others chose in haste, and were happy at leisure. Cyril had a model engine, and the girls had two dolls, as well as a china tea-set with forget-me-nots on it, to be 'between them.' The boys' 'between them' was bow and arrow. Then Uncle Richard took them on the beautiful Medway in a boat, and then they all had tea at a beautiful confectioner's and when they reached home it was far too late to have any wishes that day. They did not tell Uncle Richard anything about the Psammead. I do not know why. And they do not know why. But I daresay you can guess. The day after Uncle Richard had behaved so handsomely was a very hot day indeed. The people who decide what the weather is to be, and put its orders down for it in the newspapers every morning, said afterwards that it was the hottest day there had been for years. They had ordered it to be 'warmer, some showers,' and warmer it certainly was. In fact it was so busy being warmer that it had no time to attend to the order about showers, so there weren't any. Have you ever been up at five o'clock on a fine summer morning? It is very beautiful. The sunlight is pinky and yellowy, and all the grass and trees are covered with dew-diamonds. And all the shadows go the opposite way to the way they do in the evening, which is very interesting and makes you feel as though you were in a new other world. Anthea woke at five. She had made herself wake, and I must tell you how it is done, even if it keeps you waiting for the story to go on. You get into bed at night, and lie down quite flat on your little back, with your hands straight down by your sides. Then you say 'I  must  wake up at five' (or six, or seven, or eight, or nine, or whatever the time is that you want), and as you say it you push your chin down on your chest and then whack your head back on the pillow. And you do this as many times as there are ones in the time you want to wake up at. (It is quite an easy sum.) Of course everything depends on your really wanting to get up at five (or six, or seven, or eight, or nine); if you don't really want to, it's all of no use. But if you do, well, try it and see. Of course in this, as in doing Latin proses or getting into mischief, practice makes perfect. Anthea was quite perfect. At the very moment when she opened her eyes she heard the black-and-gold clock down in the dining-room strike eleven. So she knew it was three minutes to five. The black-and-gold clock always struck wrong, but it was all right when you knew what it meant. It was like a person talking a foreign language. If you know the language it is just as easy to understand as English. And Anthea knew the clock language. She was very sleepy, but she jumped out of bed and put her face and hands into a basin of cold water. This is a fairy charm that prevents your wanting to get back into bed again. Then she dressed, and folded up her night dress. She did not tumble it together by the sleeves, but folded it by the seams from the hem, and that will show you the kind of well-brought-up little girl she was. Then she took her shoes in her hand and crept softly down the stairs. She opened the dining-room window and climbed out. It would have been just as easy to go out by the door, but the window was more romantic, and less likely to be noticed by Martha. 'I will always get up at five,' she said to herself. 'It was quite too awfully pretty for anything.' Her heart was beating very fast, for she was carrying out a plan quite her own. She could not be sure that it was a good plan, but she was quite sure that it would not be any better if she were to tell the others about it. And she had a feeling that, right or wrong, she would rather go through with it alone. She put on her shoes under the iron verandah, on the red-and-yellow shining tiles, and then she ran straight to the sand-pit, and found the Psammead's place, and dug it out; it was very cross indeed. 'It's too bad,' it said, fluffing up its fur as pigeons do their feathers at Christmas time. 'The weather's arctic, and it's the middle of the night.' 'I'm so sorry,' said Anthea gently, and she took off her white pinafore and covered the Sand-fairy up with it, all but its head, its bat's ears, and its eyes that were like a snail's eyes. 'Thank you,' it said, 'that's better. What's the wish this morning?' 'I don't know,' she said; 'that's just it. You see we've been very unlucky, so far. I wanted to talk to you about it. But, would you mind not giving me any wishes till after breakfast? It's so hard to talk to anyone if they jump out at you with wishes you don't really want!' 'You shouldn't say you wish for things if you don't wish for them. In the old days people almost always knew whether it was Megatherium or Ichthyosaurus they really wanted for dinner.' 'I'll try not to do so,' said Anthea, 'but I do wish',  'Look out!' said the Psammead in a warning voice, and it began to blow itself out. 'Oh, this isn't a magic wish, it's just, I should be so glad if you'd not swell yourself out and nearly burst to give me anything just now. Wait till the others are here.' 'Well, well,' it said indulgently, but it shivered. 'Would you,' asked Anthea kindly, 'would you like to come and sit on my lap? You'd be warmer, and I could turn the skirt of my frock up around you. I'd be very careful.' Anthea had never expected that it would, but it did. 'Thank you,' it said; 'you really are rather thoughtful.' It crept on to her lap and snuggled down, and she put her arms round it with a rather frightened gentleness. 'Now then!' it said. 'Well then,' said Anthea, 'everything we have wished has turned out rather horrid. I wish you would advise us. You are so old, you must be very wise.' 'I was always generous from a child,' said the Sand-fairy. 'I've spent the whole of my waking hours in giving. But one thing I won't give, that's advice.' 'You see,' Anthea went on, 'it's such a wonderful thing, such a splendid, glorious chance. It's so good and kind and dear of you to give us our wishes, and it seems such a pity it should all be wasted just because we are too silly to know what to wish for.' Anthea had meant to say that, and she had not wanted to say it before the others. It's one thing to say you're silly, and quite another to say that other people are. 'Child,' said the Sand-fairy sleepily, 'I can only advise you to think before you speak',  'But I thought you never gave advice.' 'That piece doesn't count,' it said. 'You'll never take it! Besides, it's not original. It's in all the copy-books.' 'But won't you just say if you think wings would be a silly wish?' 'Wings?' it said. 'I should think you might do worse. Only, take care you aren't flying high at sunset. There was a little Ninevite boy I heard of once. He was one of King Sennacherib's sons, and a traveller brought him a Psammead. He used to keep it in a box of sand on the palace terrace. It was a dreadful degradation for one of us, of course; still the boy  was  the Assyrian King's son. And one day he wished for wings and got them. But he forgot that they would turn into stone at sunset, and when they did he fell on to one of the winged lions at the top of his father's great staircase; and what with  his  stone wings and the lion's stone wings, well it's not a very pretty story! But I believe the boy enjoyed himself very much till then.' 'Tell me,' said Anthea, 'why don't our wishes turn into stone now? Why do they just vanish?' ' Autre temps autres moeurs ,' said the creature. 'Is that the Ninevite language?' asked Anthea, who had learned no foreign language at school except French. 'What I mean is,' the Psammead went on, 'that in the old days people wished for good solid everyday gifts,, Mammoths and Pterodactyls and things,, and those could be turned into stone as easy as not. But people wish such high-flying fanciful things nowadays. How are you going to turn being beautiful as the day, or being wanted by everybody, into stone? You see it can't be done. And it would never do to have two rules, so they simply vanish. If being beautiful as the day  could  be turned into stone it would last an awfully long time, you know, much longer than you would. Just look at the Greek statues. It's just as well as it is. Good-bye. I  am  so sleepy.' It jumped off her lap, dug frantically, and vanished. Anthea was late for breakfast. It was Robert who quietly poured a spoonful of molasses down the Lamb's frock, so that he had to be taken away and washed thoroughly directly after breakfast. And it was of course a very naughty thing to do; yet it served two purposes, it delighted the Lamb, who loved above all things to be completely sticky, and it engaged Martha's attention so that the others could slip away to the sand-pit without the Lamb. They did it, and in the lane Anthea, breathless from the hurry of that slipping, panted out,  'I want to propose we take turns to wish. Only, nobody's to have a wish if the others don't think it's a nice wish. Do you agree?' 'Who's to have first wish?' asked Robert cautiously. 'Me, if you don't mind,' said Anthea apologetically. 'And I've thought about it, and it's  wings .' There was a silence. The others rather wanted to find fault, but it was hard, because the word 'wings' raised a flutter of joyous excitement in every breast. 'Not so dusty,' said Cyril generously; and Robert added, 'Really, Panther, you're not quite such a fool as you look.' Jane said, 'I think it would be perfectly lovely. It's like a bright dream of delirium.' They found the Sand-fairy easily. Anthea said,  'I wish we all had beautiful wings to fly with.' The Sand-fairy blew himself out, and next moment each child felt a funny feeling, half heaviness and half lightness, on its shoulders. The Psammead put its head on one side and turned its snail eyes from one side to the other. [Illustration: The Sand-fairy blew himself out] 'Not so bad,' it said dreamily. 'But really, Robert, you're not quite such an angel as you look.' Robert almost blushed. The wings were very big, and more beautiful than you can possibly imagine, for they were soft and smooth, and every feather lay neatly in its place. And the feathers were of the most lovely mixed changing colors, like the rainbow, or iridescent glass, or the beautiful scum that sometimes floats on water that is not at all nice to drink. 'Oh, but how can we fly?' Jane said, standing anxiously first on one foot and then on the other. 'Look out!' said Cyril; 'you're treading on my wing.' 'Does it hurt?' asked Anthea with interest; but no one answered, for Robert had spread his wings and jumped up, and now he was slowly rising in the air. He looked very awkward in his knickerbocker suit, his boots in particular hung helplessly, and seemed much larger than when he was standing in them. But the others cared but little how he looked,, or how they looked, for that matter. For now they all spread out their wings and rose in the air. Of course you all know what flying feels like, because everyone has dreamed about flying, and is seems so beautifully easy, only, you can never remember how you did it; and as a rule you have to do it without wings, in your dreams, which is more clever and uncommon, but not so easy to remember the rule for. Now the four children rose flapping from the ground, and you can't think how good the air felt as it ran against their faces. Their wings were tremendously wide when they were spread out, and they had to fly quite a long way apart so as not to get in each other's way. But little things like this are easily learned. All the words in the English Dictionary, and in the Greek Lexicon as well, are, I find, of no use at all to tell you exactly what it feels like to be flying, so I will not try. But I will say that to look  down  on the fields and woods instead of  along  at them, is something like looking at a beautiful live map, where, instead of silly colors on paper, you have real moving sunny woods and green fields laid out one after the other. As Cyril said, and I can't think where he got hold of such a strange expression, 'It does you a fair treat!' It was most wonderful and more like real magic than any wish the children had had yet. They flapped and flew and sailed on their great rainbow wings, between green earth and blue sky; and they flew over Rochester and then swerved round towards Maidstone, and presently they all began to feel extremely hungry. Curiously enough, this happened when they were flying rather low, and just as they were crossing an orchard where some early plums shone red and ripe. [Illustration: They flew over Rochester] They paused on their wings. I cannot explain to you how this is done, but it is something like treading water when you are swimming, and hawks do it extremely well. 'Yes, I daresay,' said Cyril, though no one had spoken. 'But stealing is stealing even if you've got wings.' 'Do you really think so?' said Jane briskly. 'If you've got wings you're a bird, and no one minds birds breaking the commandments. At least, they may  mind , but the birds always do it, and no one scolds them or sends them to prison.' It was not so easy to perch on a plum-tree as you might think, because the rainbow wings were so  very  large; but somehow they all managed to do it, and the plums were certainly very sweet and juicy. Fortunately, it was not till they had all had quite as many plums as were good for them that they saw a stout man, who looked exactly as though he owned the plum-trees, come hurrying through the orchard gate with a thick stick, and with one accord they disentangled their wings from the plum-laden branches and began to fly. The man stopped short, with his mouth open. For he had seen the boughs of his trees moving and twitching, and he had said to himself, 'Them young varmint, at it again!' And he had come out at once, for the lads of the village had taught him in past seasons that plums want looking after. But when he saw the rainbow wings flutter up out of the plum-tree he felt that he must have gone quite mad, and he did not like the feeling at all. And when Anthea looked down and saw his mouth go slowly open, and stay so, and his face become green and mauve in patches, she called out,  'Don't be frightened,' and felt hastily in her pocket for a threepenny-bit with a hole in it, which she had meant to hang on a ribbon round her neck, for luck. She hovered round the unfortunate plum-owner, and said, 'We have had some of your plums; we thought it wasn't stealing, but now I am not so sure. So here's some money to pay for them.' She swooped down toward the terror-stricken grower of plums, and slipped the coin into the pocket of his jacket, and in a few flaps she had rejoined the others. The farmer sat down on the grass, suddenly and heavily. [Illustration: The farmer sat down on the grass suddenly and heavily] 'Well, I'm blessed!' he said. 'This here is what they call delusions, I suppose. But this here threepenny', he had pulled it out and bitten it,, ' that's  real enough. Well, from this day forth I'll be a better man. It's the kind of thing to sober a chap for life, this is. I'm glad it was only wings, though. I'd rather see the birds as aren't there, and couldn't be, even if they pretend to talk, than some things as I could name.' He got up slowly and heavily, and went indoors, and he was so nice to his wife that day that she felt quite happy, and said to herself, 'Law, whatever have a-come to the man!' and smartened herself up and put a blue ribbon bow at the place where her collar fastened on, and looked so pretty that he was kinder than ever. So perhaps the winged children really did do one good thing that day. If so, it was the only one; for really there is nothing like wings for getting you into trouble. But, on the other hand, if you are in trouble, there is nothing like wings for getting you out of it. This was the case in the matter of the fierce dog who sprang out at them when they had folded up their wings as small as possible and were going up to a farm door to ask for a crust of bread and cheese, for in spite of the plums they were soon just as hungry as ever again. Now there is no doubt whatever that, if the four had been ordinary wingless children, that black and fierce dog would have had a good bite out of the brown-stockinged leg of Robert, who was the nearest. But at its first growl there was a flutter of wings, and the dog was left to strain at his chain and stand on his hind-legs as if he were trying to fly too. They tried several other farms, but at those where there were no dogs the people were far too frightened to do anything but scream; and at last, when it was nearly four o'clock, and their wings were getting miserably stiff and tired, they alighted on a church-tower and held a council of war. 'We can't possibly fly all the way home without dinner  or  tea,' said Robert with desperate decision. 'And nobody will give us any dinner, or even lunch, let alone tea,' said Cyril. 'Perhaps the clergyman here might,' suggested Anthea. 'He must know all about angels',  'Anybody could see we're not that,' said Jane. 'Look at Robert's boots and Squirrel's plaid necktie.' 'Well,' said Cyril firmly, 'if the country you're in won't  sell  provisions, you  take  them. In wars I mean. I'm quite certain you do. And even in other stories no good brother would allow his little sisters to starve in the midst of plenty.' 'Plenty?' repeated Robert hungrily; and the others looked vaguely round the bare leads of the church-tower, and murmured, 'In the midst of?' 'Yes,' said Cyril impressively. 'There is a larder window at the side of the clergyman's house, and I saw things to eat inside, custard pudding and cold chicken and tongue, and pies, and jam. It's rather a high window, but with wings',  'How clever of you!' said Jane. 'Not at all,' said Cyril modestly; 'any born general, Napoleon or the Duke of Marlborough, would have seen it just the same as I did.' 'It seems very wrong,' said Anthea. 'Nonsense,' said Cyril. 'What was it Sir Philip Sidney said when the soldier wouldn't give him a drink?, 'My necessity is greater than his.'' 'We'll club together our money, though, and leave it to pay for the things, won't we?' Anthea was persuasive, and very nearly in tears, because it is most trying to feel enormously hungry and unspeakably sinful at one and the same time. 'Some of it,' was the cautious reply. Everyone now turned out its pockets on the lead roof of the tower, where visitors for the last hundred and fifty years had cut their own and their sweethearts' initials with penknives in the soft lead. There was five-and-seven-pence halfpenny altogether, and even the upright Anthea admitted that that was too much to pay for four people's dinners. Robert said he thought eighteenpence. [Illustration: Every one now turned out his pockets] And half-a-crown was finally agreed to be 'handsome.' So Anthea wrote on the back of her last term's report, which happened to be in her pocket, and from which she first tore her own name and that of the school, the following letter:,            'DEAR REVEREND CLERGYMAN,, We are very hungry           indeed because of having to fly all day, and we           think it is not stealing when you are starving to           death. We are afraid to ask you for fear you           should say 'No,' because of course you know about           angels, but you would not think we were angels. We           will only take the necessities of life, and no           pudding or pie, to show you it is not grediness           but true starvation that makes us make your larder           stand and deliver. But we are not highwaymen by           trade.' 'Cut it short,' said the others with one accord. And Anthea hastily added,            'Our intentions are quite honourable if you only           knew. And here is half-a-crown to show we are           sinseer and grateful.           'Thank you for your kind hospitality.                                           'FROM US FOUR.' The half-crown was wrapped in this letter, and all the children felt that when the clergyman had read it he would understand everything, as well as anyone could who had not even seen the wings. 'Now,' said Cyril, 'of course there's some risk; we'd better fly straight down the other side of the tower and then flutter low across the churchyard and in through the shrubbery. There doesn't seem to be anyone about. But you never know. The window looks out into the shrubbery. It is embowered in foliage, like a window in a story. I'll go in and get the things. Robert and Anthea can take them as I hand them out through the window; and Jane can keep watch,, her eyes are sharp,, and whistle if she sees anyone about. Shut up, Robert! she can whistle quite well enough for that, anyway. It ought not to be a very good whistle, it'll sound more natural and birdlike. Now then, off we go!' I cannot pretend that stealing is right. I can only say that on this occasion it did not look like stealing to the hungry four, but appeared in the light of a fair and reasonable business transaction. They had never happened to learn that a tongue,, hardly cut into,, a chicken and a half, a loaf of bread, and a syphon of soda-water cannot be bought in the stores for half-a-crown. These were the necessaries of life, which Cyril handed out of the larder window when, quite unobserved and without hindrance or adventure, he had led the others to that happy spot. He felt that to refrain from jam, apple pie, cake, and mixed candied peel, was a really heroic act, and I agree with him. He was also proud of not taking the custard pudding,, and there I think he was wrong,, because if he had taken it there would have been a difficulty about returning the dish; no one, however starving, has a right to steal china pie-dishes with little pink flowers on them. The soda-water syphon was different. They could not do without something to drink, and as the maker's name was on it they felt sure it would be returned to him wherever they might leave it. If they had time they would take it back themselves. The man appeared to live in Rochester, which would not be much out of their way home. [Illustration: These were the necessaries of life] Everything was carried up to the top of the tower, and laid down on a sheet of kitchen paper which Cyril had found on the top shelf of the larder. As he unfolded it, Anthea said, 'I don't think  that's  a necessity of life.' 'Yes, it is,' said he. 'We must put the things down somewhere to cut them up; and I heard father say the other day people got diseases from germans in rain-water. Now there must be lots of rain-water here,, and when it dries up the germans are left, and they'd get into the things, and we should all die of scarlet fever.' 'What are germans?' 'Little waggly things you see with microscopes,' said Cyril, with a scientific air. 'They give you every illness you can think of. I'm sure the paper was a necessary, just as much as the bread and meat and water. Now then! Oh, I'm hungry!' I do not wish to describe the picnic party on the top of the tower. You can imagine well enough what it is like to carve a chicken and a tongue with a knife that has only one blade and that snapped off short about half-way down. But it was done. Eating with your fingers is greasy and difficult, and paper dishes soon get to look very spotty and horrid. But one thing you  can't  imagine, and that is how soda-water behaves when you try to drink it straight out of a syphon, especially a quite full one. But if imagination will not help you, experience will, and you can easily try it for yourself if you can get a grown-up to give you the syphon. If you want to have a really thorough experience, put the tube in your mouth and press the handle very suddenly and very hard. You had better do it when you are alone, and out of doors is best for this experiment. However you eat them, tongue and chicken and new bread are very good things, and no one minds being sprinkled a little with soda-water on a really fine hot day. So that everyone enjoyed the dinner very much indeed, and everyone ate as much as it possibly could: first, because it was extremely hungry; and secondly, because, as I said, tongue and chicken and new bread are very nice. Now, I daresay you will have noticed that if you have to wait for your dinner till long after the proper time, and then eat a great deal more dinner than usual, and sit in the hot sun on the top of a church-tower, or even anywhere else, you become soon and strangely sleepy. Now Anthea and Jane and Cyril and Robert were very like you in many ways, and when they had eaten all they could, and drunk all there was, they became sleepy, strangely and soon, especially Anthea, because she had gotten up so early. [Illustration: The children were fast asleep] One by one they left off talking and leaned back, and before it was a quarter of an hour after dinner they had all curled round and tucked themselves up under their large soft warm wings and were fast asleep. And the sun was sinking slowly in the west. (I must say it was in the west, because it is usual in books to say so, for fear careless people should think it was setting in the east. In point of fact, it was not exactly in the west either, but that's near enough.) The sun, I repeat, was sinking slowly in the west, and the children slept warmly and happily on, for wings are cosier than eider-down quilts to sleep under. The shadow of the church-tower fell across the churchyard, and across the Vicarage, and across the field beyond; and presently there were no more shadows, and the sun had set, and the wings were gone. And still the children slept. But not for long. Twilight is very beautiful, but it is chilly; and you know, however sleepy you are, you wake up soon enough if your brother or sister happens to be up first and pulls your blankets off you. The four wingless children shivered and woke. And there they were,, on the top of a church-tower in the dusky twilight, with blue stars coming out by ones and twos and tens and twenties over their heads,, miles away from home, with three shillings and three-halfpence in their pockets, and a doubtful act about the necessities of life to be accounted for if anyone found them with the soda-water syphon. They looked at each other. Cyril spoke first, picking up the syphon,  'We'd better get along down and get rid of this beastly thing. It's dark enough to leave it on the clergyman's doorstep, I should think. Come on.' There was a little turret at the corner of the tower, and the little turret had a door in it. They had noticed this when they were eating, but had not explored it, as you would have done in their place. Because, of course, when you have wings and can explore the whole sky, doors seem hardly worth exploring. Now they turned towards it. 'Of course,' said Cyril 'this is the way down.' It was. But the door was locked on the inside! And the world was growing darker and darker. And they were miles from home. And there was the soda-water syphon. I shall not tell you whether anyone cried, nor, if so, how many cried, nor who cried. You will be better employed in making up your minds what you would have done if you had been in their place. CHAPTER V NO WINGS Whether anyone cried or not, there was certainly an interval during which none of the party was quite itself. When they grew calmer, Anthea put her handkerchief in her pocket and her arm round Jane, and said,  'It can't be for more than one night. We can signal with our handkerchiefs in the morning. They'll be dry then. And someone will come up and let us out',  'And find the syphon,' said Cyril gloomily; 'and we shall be sent to prison for stealing',  'You said it wasn't stealing. You said you were sure it wasn't.' 'I'm not sure  now ' said Cyril shortly. 'Let's throw the thing away among the trees,' said Robert, 'then no one can do anything to us.' 'Oh yes,', Cyril's laugh was not a light-hearted one,, 'and hit some chap on the head, and be murderers as well as, as the other thing.' 'But we can't stay up here all night,' said Jane; 'and I want my tea.' 'You  can't  want your tea,' said Robert; 'you've only just had your dinner.' 'But I  do  want it,' she said; 'especially when you begin talking about stopping up here all night. Oh, Panther, I want to go home! I want to go home!' 'Hush, hush,' Anthea said. 'Don't, dear. It'll be all right, somehow. Don't, don't',  'Let her cry,' said Robert desperately; 'if she howls loud enough, someone may hear and come and let us out.' 'And see the soda-water thing,' said Anthea swiftly. 'Robert, don't be a brute. Oh, Jane, do try to be a man! It's just the same for all of us.' Jane did try to 'be a man', and reduced her howls to sniffs. There was a pause. Then Cyril said slowly, 'Look here. We must risk that syphon. I'll button it up inside my jacket, perhaps no one will notice it. You others keep well in front of me. There are lights in the clergyman's house. They've not gone to bed yet. We must just yell as loud as ever we can. Now all scream when I say three. Robert, you do the yell like a railway engine, and I'll do the coo-ee like father's. The girls can do as they please. One, two, three!' A four-fold yell rent the silent peace of the evening, and a maid at one of the Vicarage windows paused with her hand on the blind-cord. 'One, two, three!' Another yell, piercing and complex, startled the owls and starlings to a flutter of feathers in the belfry below. The maid flew from the Vicarage window and ran down the Vicarage stairs and into the Vicarage kitchen, and fainted as soon as she had explained to the man-servant and the cook and the cook's cousin that she had seen a ghost. It was quite untrue, of course, but I suppose the girl's nerves were a little upset by the yelling. 'One, two, three!' The Vicar was on his doorstep by this time, and there was no mistaking the yell that greeted him. 'Goodness me,' he said to his wife, 'my dear, someone's being murdered in the church! Give me my hat and a thick stick, and tell Andrew to come after me. I expect it's the lunatic who stole the tongue.' The children had seen the flash of light when the Vicar opened his front door. They had seen his dark form on his doorstep, and they had paused for breath, and also to see what he would do. When he turned back for his hat, Cyril said hastily,  'He thinks he only fancied he heard something. You don't half yell! Now! One, two, three!' It was certainly a whole yell this time, and the Vicar's wife flung her arms round her husband and screamed a feeble echo of it. 'You shan't go!' she said, 'not alone. Jessie!', the maid unfainted and came out of the kitchen,, 'send Andrew at once. There's a dangerous lunatic in the church, and he must go immediately and catch him.' 'I expect he  will  catch it too,' said Jessie to herself as she went through the kitchen door. 'Here, Andrew,' she said, 'there's someone screaming like mad in the church, and the missus says you're to go along and catch it.' 'Not alone, I don't,' said Andrew in low firm tones. To his master he merely said, 'Yis sir.' 'You heard those screams?' 'I did think I noticed a sort of something,' said Andrew. 'Well, come on, then,' said the Vicar. 'My dear, I  must  go!' He pushed her gently into the sitting-room, banged the door, and rushed out, dragging Andrew by the arm. A volley of yells greeted them. Then as it died into silence Andrew shouted, 'Hullo, you there! Did you call?' 'Yes,' shouted four far-away voices. 'They seem to be in the air,' said the Vicar. 'Very remarkable.' 'Where are you?' shouted Andrew; and Cyril replied in his deepest voice, very slow and loud,  'CHURCH! TOWER! TOP!' 'Come down, then!' said Andrew; and the same voice replied,  ' Can't! Door locked! ' 'My goodness!' said the Vicar. 'Andrew, fetch the stable lantern. Perhaps it would be as well to fetch another man from the village.' 'With the rest of the gang about, very likely. No, sir; if this 'ere ain't a trap, well, may I never! There's cook's cousin at the back door now. He's a keeper, sir, and used to dealing with vicious characters. And he's got his gun, sir.' 'Hullo there!' shouted Cyril from the church-tower; 'come up and let us out.' 'We're a-coming,' said Andrew. 'I'm a-going to get a policeman and a gun.' 'Andrew, Andrew,' said the Vicar, 'that's not the truth.' 'It's near enough, sir, for the likes of them.' So Andrew fetched the lantern and the cook's cousin; and the Vicar's wife begged them all to be very careful. They went across the churchyard, it was quite dark now, and as they went they talked. The Vicar was certain a lunatic was on the church-tower, the one who had written the mad letter, and taken the cold tongue and things. Andrew thought it was a 'trap'; the cook's cousin alone was calm. 'Great cry, little wool,' said he; 'dangerous chaps is quieter.' He was not at all afraid. But then he had a gun. That was why he was asked to lead the way up the worn, steep, dark steps of the church-tower. He did lead the way, with the lantern in one hand and the gun in the other. Andrew went next. He pretended afterwards that this was because he was braver than his master, but really it was because he thought of traps and he did not like the idea of being behind the others for fear someone should come softly up behind him and catch hold of his legs in the dark. They went on and on, and round and round the little corkscrew staircase, then through the bell-ringers' loft, where the bell-ropes hung with soft furry ends like giant caterpillars, then up another stair into the belfry, where the big quiet bells are, and then on up a ladder with broad steps, and then up a little stone stair. And at the top of that there was a little door. And the door was bolted on the stair side. The cook's cousin, who was a gamekeeper, kicked at the door, and said,  'Hullo, you there!' The children were holding on to each other on the other side of the door, and trembling with anxiousness, and very hoarse with their howls. They could hardly speak, but Cyril managed to reply huskily,  'Hullo, you there!' 'How did you get up there?' It was no use saying 'We flew up,' so Cyril said,  'We got up, and then we found the door was locked and we couldn't get down. Let us out, do.' 'How many of you are there?' asked the keeper. 'Only four,' said Cyril. 'Are you armed?' 'Are we what?' 'I've got my gun handy, so you'd best not try any tricks,' said the keeper. 'If we open the door, will you promise to come quietly down, and no nonsense?' 'Yes, oh YES!' said all the children together. 'Bless me,' said the Vicar, 'surely that was a female voice?' 'Shall I open the door, sir?' said the keeper. Andrew went down a few steps, 'to leave room for the others' he said afterwards. 'Yes,' said the Vicar, 'open the door. Remember,' he said through the keyhole, 'we have come to release you. You will keep your promise to refrain from violence?' 'How this bolt do stick,' said the keeper; 'anyone 'ud think it hadn't been drawed for half a year.' As a matter of fact it hadn't. When all the bolts were drawn, the keeper spoke deep-chested words through the keyhole. [Illustration: The keeper spoke deep-chested words through the keyhole] 'I don't open,' said he, 'till you've gone over to the other side of the tower. And if one of you comes at me I fire. Now!' 'We're all over on the other side,' said the voices. The keeper felt pleased with himself, and owned himself a bold man when he threw open that door, and, stepping out into the leads, flashed the full light of the stable lantern on the group of desperadoes standing against the parapet on the other side of the tower. He lowered his gun, and he nearly dropped the lantern. 'So help me,' he cried, 'if they ain't a pack of kiddies!' The Vicar now advanced. 'How did you come here?' he asked severely. 'Tell me at once.' 'Oh, take us down,' said Jane, catching at his coat, 'and we'll tell you anything you like. You won't believe us, but it doesn't matter. Oh, take us down!' The others crowded round him, with the same entreaty. All but Cyril. He had enough to do with the soda-water syphon, which would keep slipping down under his jacket. It needed both hands to keep it steady in its place. But he said, standing as far out of the lantern light as possible,  'Please do take us down.' So they were taken down. It is no joke to go down a strange church-tower in the dark, but the keeper helped them, only, Cyril had to be independent because of the soda-water syphon. It would keep trying to get away. Half-way down the ladder it all but escaped. Cyril just caught it by its spout, and as nearly as possible lost his footing. He was trembling and pale when at last they reached the bottom of the winding stair and stepped out on to the stones of the church-porch. Then suddenly the keeper caught Cyril and Robert each by an arm. 'You bring along the gells, sir,' said he; 'you and Andrew can manage them.' 'Let go!' said Cyril; 'we aren't running away. We haven't hurt your old church. Leave go!' 'You just come along,' said the keeper; and Cyril dared not oppose him with violence, because just then the syphon began to slip again. So they were marched into the Vicarage study, and the Vicar's wife came rushing in. 'Oh, William,  are  you safe?' she cried. Robert hastened to allay her anxiety. 'Yes,' he said, 'he's quite safe. We haven't hurt them at all. And please, we're very late, and they'll be anxious at home. Could you send us home in your carriage?' 'Or perhaps there's a hotel near where we could get a carriage,' said Anthea. 'Martha will be very anxious as it is.' The Vicar had sunk into a chair, overcome by emotion and amazement. Cyril had also sat down, and was leaning forward with his elbows on his knees because of the soda-water syphon. 'But how did you come to be locked up in the church-tower?' asked the Vicar. 'We went up,' said Robert slowly, 'and we were tired, and we all went to sleep, and when we woke up we found the door was locked, so we yelled.' 'I should think you did!' said the Vicar's wife. 'Frightening everybody out of their wits like this! You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.' 'We  are ,' said Jane gently. 'But who locked the door?' asked the Vicar. 'I don't know at all,' said Robert, with perfect truth. 'Do please send us home.' 'Well, really,' said the Vicar, 'I suppose we'd better. Andrew, put the horse to, and you can take them home.' 'Not alone, I don't,' said Andrew to himself. And the Vicar went on, 'let this be a lesson to you', ,  He went on talking, and the children listened miserably. But the keeper was not listening. He was looking at the unfortunate Cyril. He knew all about poachers, of course, so he knew how people look when they're hiding something. The Vicar had just got to the part about trying to grow up to be a blessing to your parents, and not a trouble and disgrace, when the keeper suddenly said,  'Arst him what he's got there under his jacket;' and Cyril knew that concealment was at an end. So he stood up, and squared his shoulders and tried to look noble, like the boys in books that no one can look in the face of and doubt that they come of brave and noble families, and will be faithful to the death, and he pulled out the syphon and said,  'Well, there you are, then.' There was silence. Cyril went on, there was nothing else for it,  'Yes, we took this out of your larder, and some chicken and tongue and bread. We were very hungry, and we didn't take the custard or jam. We only took bread and meat and water,, and we couldn't help its being soda kind,, just the necessaries of life; and we left half-a-crown to pay for it, and we left a letter. And we're very sorry. And my father will pay a fine and anything you like, but don't send us to prison. Mother would be so vexed. You know what you said about not being a disgrace. Well, don't you go and do it to us, that's all! We're as sorry as we can be. There!' 'However did you get up to the larder window?' said Mrs. Vicar. 'I can't tell you that,' said Cyril firmly. 'Is this the whole truth you've been telling me?' asked the clergyman. 'No,' answered Jane suddenly; 'it's all true, but it's not the whole truth. We can't tell you that. It's no good asking. Oh, do forgive us and take us home!' She ran to the Vicar's wife and threw her arms round her. The Vicar's wife put her arms round Jane, and the keeper whispered behind his hand to the Vicar,  'They're all right, sir, I expect it's a pal they're standing by. Someone put 'em up to it, and they won't peach. Game little kids.' 'Tell me,' said the Vicar kindly, 'are you screening someone else? Had anyone else anything to do with this?' 'Yes,' said Anthea, thinking of the Psammead; 'but it wasn't their fault.' 'Very well, my dears,' said the Vicar, 'then let's say no more about it. Only just tell us why you wrote such an odd letter.' 'I don't know,' said Cyril. 'You see, Anthea wrote it in such a hurry, and it really didn't seem like stealing then. But afterwards, when we found we couldn't get down off the church-tower, it seemed just exactly like it. We are all very sorry',  'Say no more about it,' said the Vicar's wife; 'but another time just think before you take other people's tongues. Now, some cake and milk before you go home?' When Andrew came to say that the horse was put to, and was he expected to be led alone into the trap that he had plainly seen from the first, he found the children eating cake and drinking milk and laughing at the Vicar's jokes. Jane was sitting on the Vicar's wife's lap. So you see they got off better than they deserved. The gamekeeper, who was the cook's cousin, asked leave to drive home with them, and Andrew was only too glad to have someone to protect him from that trap he was so certain of. When the wagonette reached their own house, between the chalk-quarry and the gravel-pit, the children were very sleepy, but they felt that they and the keeper were friends for life. Andrew dumped the children down at the iron gate without a word. 'You get along home,' said the Vicarage cook's cousin, who was a gamekeeper. 'I'll get me home on shanks' mare.' So Andrew had to drive off alone, which he did not like at all, and it was the keeper that was cousin to the Vicarage cook who went with the children to the door, and, when they had been swept to bed in a whirlwind of reproaches, remained to explain to Martha and the cook and the housemaid exactly what had happened. He explained so well that Martha was quite amicable the next morning. After that he often used to come over and see Martha, and in the end, but that is another story, as dear Mr. Kipling says. Martha was obliged to stick to what she had said the night before about keeping the children indoors the next day for a punishment. But she wasn't at all ugly about it, and agreed to let Robert go out for half an hour to get something he particularly wanted. This, of course, was the day's wish. Robert rushed to the gravel-pit, found the Psammead, and presently wished for,  But that, too, is another story. CHAPTER VI A CASTLE AND NO DINNER The others were to be kept in as a punishment for the misfortunes of the day before. Of course Martha thought it was naughtiness, and not misfortune, so you must not blame her. She only thought she was doing her duty. You know, grown-up people often say they do not like to punish you, and that they only do it for your own good, and that it hurts them as much as it hurts you, and this is really very often the truth. Martha certainly hated having to punish the children quite as much as they hated to be punished. For one thing, she knew what a noise there would be in the house all day. And she had other reasons. 'I declare,' she said to the cook, 'it seems almost a shame keeping of them indoors this lovely day; but they are that audacious, they'll be walking in with their heads knocked off some of these days, if I don't put my foot down. You make them a cake for tea to-morrow, dear. And we'll have Baby along of us soon as we've got a bit forrard with our work. Then they can have a good romp with him, out of the way. Now, Eliza, come, get on with them beds. Here's ten o'clock nearly, and no rabbits caught!' People say that in Kent when they mean 'and no work done.' So all the others were kept in, but Robert, as I have said, was allowed to go out for half an hour to get something they all wanted. And that, of course, was the day's wish. He had no difficulty in finding the Sand-fairy, for the day was already so hot that it had actually, for the first time, come out of its own accord, and was sitting in a sort of pool of soft sand, stretching itself, and trimming its whiskers, and turning its snail's eyes round and round. 'Ha!' it said when its left eye saw Robert; 'I've been looking for you. Where are the rest of you? Not smashed themselves up with those wings, I hope?' 'No,' said Robert; 'but the wings got us into a row, just like all the wishes always do. So the others are kept indoors, and I was only let out for half an hour, to get the wish. So please let me wish as quickly as I can.' 'Wish away,' said the Psammead, twisting itself round in the sand. But Robert couldn't wish away. He forgot all the things he had been thinking about, and nothing would come into his head but little things for himself, like candy, a foreign stamp album, or a knife with three blades and a corkscrew. He sat down to think better of things the others would not have cared for, such as a football, or a pair of leg-guards, or to be able to lick Simpkins Minor thoroughly when he went back to school. 'Well,' said the Psammead at last, 'you'd better hurry up with that wish of yours. Time flies.' 'I know it does,' said Robert. ' I  can't think what to wish for. I wish you could give one of the others their wish without their having to come here to ask for it. Oh,  don't !' But it was too late. The Psammead had blown itself out to about three times its proper size, and now it collapsed like a pricked bubble, and with a deep sigh leaned back against the edge of the sand-pool, quite faint with the effort. 'There!' it said in a weak voice; 'it was tremendously hard, but I did it. Run along home, or they're sure to wish for something silly before you get there.' They were, quite sure; Robert felt this, and as he ran home his mind was deeply occupied with the sort of wishes he might find they had wished in his absence. They might wish for rabbits, or white mice, or chocolate, or a fine day to-morrow, or even, and that was most likely, someone might have said, 'I do wish to goodness Robert would hurry up.' Well, he  was  hurrying up, and so they would have had their wish, and the day would be wasted. Then he tried to think what they could wish for, something that would be amusing indoors. That had been his own difficulty from the beginning. So few things are amusing indoors when the sun is shining outside and you mayn't go out, however much you want to do so. Robert was running as fast as he could, but when he turned the corner that ought to have brought him within sight of the architect's nightmare, the ornamental iron-work on the top of the house, he opened his eyes so wide that he had to drop into a walk; for you cannot run with your eyes wide open. Then suddenly he stopped short, for there was no house to be seen. The front garden railings were gone too, and where the house had stood, Robert rubbed his eyes and looked again. Yes, the others  had  wished,, there was no doubt about it,, and they must have wished that they lived in a castle; for there the castle stood, black and stately, and very tall and broad, with battlements and lancet windows, and eight great towers; and, where the garden and the orchard had been, there were white things dotted like mushrooms. Robert walked slowly on, and as he got nearer he saw that these were tents, and men in armor were walking about among the tents, crowds and crowds of them. [Illustration: There the castle stood, black and stately] 'Oh!' said Robert fervently. 'They  have ! They've wished for a castle, and it's being besieged! It's just like that Sand-fairy! I wish we'd never seen the beastly thing!' At the little window above the great gateway, across the moat that now lay where the garden had been but half an hour ago, someone was waving something pale dust-colored. Robert thought it was one of Cyril's handkerchiefs. They had never been white since the day when he had upset the bottle of 'Combined Toning and Fixing Solution' into the drawer where they were. Robert waved back, and immediately felt that he had been unwise. For this signal had been seen by the besieging force, and two men in steel-caps were coming towards him. They had high brown boots on their long legs, and they came towards him with such great strides that Robert remembered the shortness of his own legs and did not run away. He knew it would be useless to himself, and he feared it might be irritating to the foe. So he stood still, and the two men seemed quite pleased with him. 'By my halidom,' said one, 'a brave varlet this!' Robert felt pleased at being  called  brave, and somehow it made him  feel  brave. He passed over the 'varlet.' It was the way people talked in historical romances for the young, he knew, and it was evidently not meant for rudeness. He only hoped he would be able to understand what they said to him. He had not been always able quite to follow the conversations in the historical romances for the young. 'His garb is strange,' said the other. 'Some outlandish treachery, belike.' 'Say, lad, what brings thee hither?' Robert knew this meant, 'Now then, youngster, what are you up to here, eh?', so he said,  'If you please, I want to go home.' 'Go, then!' said the man in the longest boots; 'none hindereth, and nought lets us to follow. Zooks!' he added in a cautious undertone, 'I misdoubt me but he beareth tidings to the besieged.' 'Where dwellest thou, young knave?' inquired the man with the largest steel-cap. 'Over there,' said Robert; and directly he had said it he knew he ought to have said 'Yonder!' 'Ha, sayest so?' rejoined the longest boots. 'Come hither, boy. This is matter for our leader.' And to the leader Robert was dragged forthwith, by the reluctant ear. [Illustration: Robert was dragged forthwith, by the reluctant ear] The leader was the most glorious creature Robert had ever seen. He was exactly like the pictures Robert had so often admired in the historical romances. He had armor, and a helmet, and a horse, and a crest, and feathers, and a shield and a lance and a sword. His armor and his weapons were all, I am almost sure, of quite different periods. The shield was thirteenth century, while the sword was of the pattern used in the Peninsular War. The cuirass was of the time of Charles I., and the helmet dated from the Second Crusade. The arms on the shield were very grand, three red running lions on a blue ground. The tents were of the latest brand approved of by our modern War Office, and the whole appearance of camp, army, and leader might have been a shock to some. But Robert was dumb with admiration, and it all seemed to him perfectly correct, because he knew no more of heraldry or archæology than the gifted artists who usually drew the pictures for the historical romances. The scene was indeed 'exactly like a picture.' He admired it all so much that he felt braver than ever. 'Come hither, lad,' said the glorious leader, when the men in Cromwellian steel-caps had said a few low eager words. And he took off his helmet, because he could not see properly with it on. He had a kind face, and long fair hair. 'Have no fear; thou shalt take no scathe,' he said. Robert was glad of that. He wondered what 'scathe' was, and if it was nastier than the medicine which he had to take sometimes. 'Unfold thy tale without alarm,' said the leader kindly. 'Whence comest thou, and what is thine intent?' 'My what?' said Robert. 'What seekest thou to accomplish? What is thine errand, that thou wanderest here alone among these rough men-at-arms? Poor child, thy mother's heart aches for thee e'en now, I'll warrant me.' 'I don't think so,' said Robert; 'you see, she doesn't know I'm out.' [Illustration: He wiped away a manly tear] The leader wiped away a manly tear, exactly as a leader in a historical romance would have done, and said,  'Fear not to speak the truth, my child; thou hast nought to fear from Wulfric de Talbot.' Robert had a wild feeling that this glorious leader of the besieging party, being himself part of a wish, would be able to understand better than Martha, or the gipsies, or the policeman in Rochester, or the clergyman of yesterday, the true tale of the wishes and the Psammead. The only difficulty was that he knew he could never remember enough 'quothas' and 'beshrew me's,' and things like that, to make his talk sound like the talk of a boy in a historical romance. However, he began boldly enough, with a sentence straight out of  Ralph de Courcy; or, The Boy Crusader . He said,  'Grammercy for thy courtesy, fair sir knight. The fact is, it's like this, and I hope you're not in a hurry, because the story's rather a breather. Father and mother are away, and when we went down playing in the sand-pits we found a Psammead.' 'I cry thee mercy! A Sammyadd?' said the knight. 'Yes, a sort of, of fairy, or enchanter, yes, that's it, an enchanter; and he said we could have a wish every day, and we wished first to be beautiful.' 'Thy wish was scarce granted,' muttered one of the men-at-arms, looking at Robert, who went on as if he had not heard, though he thought the remark very rude indeed. 'And then we wished for money, treasure, you know; but we couldn't spend it. And yesterday we wished for wings, and we got them, and we had a ripping time to begin with',  'Thy speech is strange and uncouth,' said Sir Wulfric de Talbot. 'Repeat thy words, what hadst thou?' 'A ripping, I mean a jolly, no, we were contented with our lot, that's what I mean; only, after we got into an awful fix.' 'What is a fix? A fray, mayhap?' 'No, not a fray. A, a, a tight place.' 'A dungeon? Alas for thy youthful fettered limbs!' said the knight, with polite sympathy. 'It wasn't a dungeon. We just, just encountered undeserved misfortunes,' Robert explained, 'and to-day we are punished by not being allowed to go out. That's where I live,', he pointed to the castle. 'The others are in there, and they're not allowed to go out. It's all the Psammead's, I mean the enchanter's fault. I wish we'd never seen him.' 'He is an enchanter of might?' 'Oh yes, of might and main. Rather!' 'And thou deemest that it is the spells of the enchanter whom thou hast angered that have lent strength to the besieging party,' said the gallant leader; 'but know thou that Wulfric de Talbot needs no enchanter's aid to lead his followers to victory.' 'No, I'm sure you don't,' said Robert, with hasty courtesy; 'of course not, you wouldn't, you know. But, all the same, it's partly his fault, but we're most to blame. You couldn't have done anything if it hadn't been for us.' 'How now, bold boy?' asked Sir Wulfric haughtily. 'Thy speech is dark, and eke scarce courteous. Unravel me this riddle!' 'Oh,' said Robert desperately, 'of course you don't know it, but you're not  real  at all. You're only here because the others must have been idiots enough to wish for a castle, and when the sun sets you'll just vanish away, and it'll be all right.' The captain and the men-at-arms exchanged glances at first pitying, and then sterner, as the longest-booted man said, 'Beware, my noble lord; the urchin doth but feign madness to escape from our clutches. Shall we not bind him?' 'I'm no more mad than you are,' said Robert angrily, 'perhaps not so much, Only, I was an idiot to think you'd understand anything. Let me go, I haven't done anything to you.' 'Whither?' asked the knight, who seemed to have believed all the enchanter story till it came to his own share in it. 'Whither wouldst thou wend?' 'Home, of course.' Robert pointed to the castle. 'To carry news of succor? Nay!' 'All right, then,' said Robert, struck by a sudden idea; 'then let me go somewhere else.' His mind sought eagerly among the memories of the historical romance. 'Sir Wulfric de Talbot,' he said slowly, 'should think foul scorn to, to keep a chap, I mean one who has done him no hurt, when he wants to cut off quietly, I mean to depart without violence.' 'This to my face! Beshrew thee for a knave!' replied Sir Wulfric. But the appeal seemed to have gone home. 'Yet thou sayest sooth,' he added thoughtfully. 'Go where thou wilt,' he added nobly, 'thou art free. Wulfric de Talbot warreth not with babes, and Jakin here shall bear thee company.' 'All right,' said Robert wildly. 'Jakin will enjoy himself, I think. Come on, Jakin. Sir Wulfric, I salute thee.' He saluted after the modern military manner, and set off running to the sand-pit, Jakin's long boots keeping up easily. He found the Fairy. He dug it up, he woke it up, he implored it to give him one more wish. 'I've done two to-day already,' it grumbled, 'and one was as stiff a bit of work as ever I did.' 'Oh, do, do, do, do,  do !' said Robert, while Jakin looked on with an expression of open-mouthed horror at the strange beast that talked, and gazed with its snail's eyes at him. [Illustration: 'Oh, do, do,  do !' said Robert] 'Well, what is it?' snapped the Psammead, with cross sleepiness. 'I wish I was with the others,' said Robert. And the Psammead began to swell. Robert never thought of wishing the castle and the siege away. Of course he knew they had all come out of a wish, but swords and daggers and pikes and lances seemed much too real to be wished away. Robert lost consciousness for an instant. When he opened his eyes the others were crowding round him. 'We never heard you come in,' they said. 'How awfully jolly of you to wish it to give us our wish!' 'Of course we understood that was what you'd done.' 'But you ought to have told us. Suppose we'd wished something silly.' 'Silly?' said Robert, very crossly indeed. 'How much sillier could you have been, I'd like to know? You nearly settled  me , I can tell you.' Then he told his story, and the others admitted that it certainly had been rough on him. But they praised his courage and cleverness so much that he presently got back his lost temper, and felt braver than ever, and consented to be captain of the besieged force. 'We haven't done anything yet,' said Anthea comfortably; 'we waited for you. We're going to shoot at them through these little loopholes with the bow and arrows uncle gave you, and you shall have first shot.' 'I don't think I would,' said Robert cautiously; 'you don't know what they're like near to. They've got  real  bows and arrows, an awful length, and swords and pikes and daggers, and all sorts of sharp things. They're all quite, quite real. It's not just a, a picture, or a vision or anything; they can  hurt us , or kill us even, I shouldn't wonder. I can feel my ear all sore yet. Look here, have you explored the castle? Because I think we'd better let them alone as long as they let us alone. I heard that Jakin man say they weren't going to attack till just before sundown. We can be getting ready for the attack. Are there any soldiers in the castle to defend it?' 'We don't know,' said Cyril. 'You see, directly I'd wished we were in a besieged castle, everything seemed to go upside down, and when it came straight we looked out of the window, and saw the camp and things and you, and of course we kept on looking at everything. Isn't this room jolly? It's as real as real!' It was. It was square, with stone walls four feet thick, and great beams for ceiling. A low door at the corner led to a flight of steps, up and down. The children went down; they found themselves in a great arched gate-house, the enormous doors were shut and barred. There was a window in a little room at the bottom of the round turret up which the stair wound, rather larger than the other windows, and looking through it they saw that the drawbridge was up and the portcullis down; the moat looked very wide and deep. Opposite the great door that led to the moat was another great door, with a little door in it. The children went through this, and found themselves in a big courtyard, with the great grey walls of the castle rising dark and heavy on all four sides. Near the middle of the courtyard stood Martha, moving her right hand backwards and forwards in the air. The cook was stooping down and moving her hands, also in a very curious way. But the oddest and at the same time most terrible thing was the Lamb, who was sitting on nothing, about three feet from the ground, laughing happily. The children ran towards him. Just as Anthea was reaching out her arms to take him, Martha said crossly, 'Let him alone, do, miss, when he  is  good.' 'But what's he  doing ?' said Anthea. 'Doing? Why, a-setting in his high chair as good as gold, a precious, watching me doing of the ironing. Get along with you, do, my iron's cold again.' She went towards the cook, and seemed to poke an invisible fire with an unseen poker, the cook seemed to be putting an unseen dish into an invisible oven. 'Run along with you, do,' she said; 'I'm behindhand as it is. You won't get no dinner if you come a-hindering of me like this. Come, off you goes, or I'll pin a discloth to some of your tails.' 'You're  sure  the Lamb's all right?' asked Jane anxiously. 'Right as ninepence, if you don't come unsettling of him. I thought you'd like to be rid of him for to-day; but take him, if you want him, for gracious' sake.' 'No, no,' they said, and hastened away. They would have to defend the castle presently, and the Lamb was safer even suspended in mid air in an invisible kitchen than in the guard-room of the besieged castle. They went through the first doorway they came to, and sat down helplessly on a wooden bench that ran along the room inside. 'How awful!' said Anthea and Jane together; and Jane added, 'I feel as if I was in a lunatic asylum.' 'What does it mean?' Anthea said. 'It's creepy; I don't like it. I wish we'd wished for something plain, a rocking-horse, or a donkey, or something.' 'It's no use wishing  now ,' said Robert bitterly; and Cyril said,  'Do be quiet; I want to think.' He buried his face in his hands, and the others looked about them. They were in a long room with an arched roof. There were wooden tables along it, and one across at the end of the room, on a sort of raised platform. The room was very dim and dark. The floor was strewn with dry things like sticks, and they did not smell nice. Cyril sat up suddenly and said,  'Look here, it's all right. I think it's like this. You know, we wished that the servants shouldn't notice any difference when we got wishes. And nothing happens to the Lamb unless we specially wish it to. So of course they don't notice the castle or anything. But then the castle is on the same place where our house was, is, I mean, and the servants have to go on being in the house, or else they  would  notice. But you can't have a castle mixed up with our house, and so  we  can't see the house, because we see the castle; and they can't see the castle, because they go on seeing the house; and so',  'Oh,  don't ,' said Jane; 'you make my head go all swimmy, like being on a roundabout. It doesn't matter! Only, I hope we shall be able to see our dinner, that's all, because if it's invisible it'll be unfeelable as well, and then we can't eat it! I  know  it will, because I tried to feel if I could feel the Lamb's chair and there was nothing under him at all but air. And we can't eat air, and I feel just as if I hadn't had any breakfast for years and years.' 'It's no use thinking about it,' said Anthea. 'Let's go on exploring. Perhaps we might find something to eat.' This lighted hope in every breast, and they went on exploring the castle. But though it was the most perfect and delightful castle you can possibly imagine, and furnished in the most complete and beautiful manner, neither food nor men-at-arms were to be found in it. 'If you'd only thought of wishing to be besieged in a castle thoroughly garrisoned and provisioned!' said Jane reproachfully. 'You can't think of everything, you know,' said Anthea. 'I should think it must be nearly dinner-time by now.' It wasn't; but they hung about watching the strange movements of the servants in the middle of the courtyard, because, of course, they couldn't be sure where the dining-room of the invisible house was. Presently they saw Martha carrying an invisible tray across the courtyard, for it seemed that, by the most fortunate accident, the dining-room of the house and the banqueting-hall of the castle were in the same place. But oh, how their hearts sank when they perceived that the tray  was  invisible! They waited in wretched silence while Martha went through the form of carving an unseen leg of mutton and serving invisible greens and potatoes with a spoon that no one could see. When she had left the room, the children looked at the empty table, and then at each other. 'This is worse than anything,' said Robert, who had not till now been particularly keen on his dinner. 'I'm not so very hungry,' said Anthea, trying to make the best of things, as usual. Cyril tightened his belt ostentatiously. Jane burst into tears. CHAPTER VII A SIEGE AND BED The children were sitting in the gloomy banqueting-hall, at the end of one of the long bare wooden tables. There was now no hope. Martha had brought in the dinner, and the dinner was invisible, and unfeelable too; for, when they rubbed their hands along the table, they knew but too well that for them there was nothing there  but  table. Suddenly Cyril felt in his pocket. 'Right,  oh !' he cried. 'Look here! Biscuits.' Somewhat broken and crumbled, certainly, but still biscuits. Three whole ones, and a generous handful of crumbs and fragments. 'I got them this morning, cook, and I'd quite forgotten,' he explained as he divided them with scrupulous fairness into four heaps. They were eaten in a happy silence, though they had an odd taste, because they had been in Cyril's pocket all the morning with a hank of tarred twine, some green fir-cones, and a ball of cobbler's wax. 'Yes, but look here, Squirrel,' said Robert; 'you're so clever at explaining about invisibleness and all that. How is it the biscuits are here, and all the bread and meat and things have disappeared?' 'I don't know,' said Cyril after a pause, 'unless it's because  we  had them. Nothing about  us  has changed. Everything's in my pocket all right.' 'Then if we  had  the mutton it would be real,' said Robert. 'Oh, don't I wish we could find it!' 'But we can't find it. I suppose it isn't ours till we've got it in our mouths.' 'Or in our pockets,' said Jane, thinking of the biscuits. 'Who puts mutton in their pockets, goose-girl?' said Cyril. 'But I know, at any rate, I'll try it!' He leaned over the table with his face about an inch from it, and kept opening and shutting his mouth as if he were taking bites out of air. 'It's no good,' said Robert in deep dejection. 'You'll only, ,  Hullo!' Cyril stood up with a grin of triumph, holding a square piece of bread in his mouth. It was quite real. Everyone saw it. It is true that, directly he bit a piece off, the rest vanished; but it was all right, because he knew he had it in his hand though he could neither see nor feel it. He took another bite from the air between his fingers, and it turned into bread as he bit. The next moment all the others were following his example, and opening and shutting their mouths an inch or so from the bare-looking table. Robert captured a slice of mutton, and, but I think I will draw a veil over the rest of this painful scene. It is enough to say that they all had enough mutton, and that when Martha came to change the plates she said she had never seen such a mess in all her born days. The pudding was, fortunately, a plain suet one, and in answer to Martha's questions the children all with one accord said that they would  not  have molasses on it, nor jam, nor sugar, 'Just plain, please,' they said. Martha said, 'Well, I never, what next, I wonder!' and went away. Then ensued another scene on which I will not dwell, for nobody looks nice picking up slices of suet pudding from the table in its mouth, like a dog. The great thing, after all, was that they had had dinner; and now everyone felt more courage to prepare for the attack that was to be delivered before sunset. Robert, as captain, insisted on climbing to the top of one of the towers to reconnoitre, so up they all went. And now they could see all round the castle, and could see, too, that beyond the moat, on every side, tents of the besieging party were pitched. Rather uncomfortable shivers ran down the children's backs as they saw that all the men were very busy cleaning or sharpening their arms, re-stringing their bows, and polishing their shields. A large party came along the road, with horses dragging along the great trunk of a tree; and Cyril felt quite pale, because he knew this was for a battering-ram. 'What a good thing we've got a moat,' he said; 'and what a good thing the drawbridge is up, I should never have known how to work it.' 'Of course it would be up in a besieged castle.' 'You'd think there ought to have been soldiers in it, wouldn't you?' said Robert. 'You see you don't know how long it's been besieged,' said Cyril darkly; 'perhaps most of the brave defenders were killed early in the siege and all the provisions eaten, and now there are only a few intrepid survivors,, that's us, and we are going to defend it to the death.' 'How do you begin, defending to the death, I mean?' asked Anthea. 'We ought to be heavily armed, and then shoot at them when they advance to the attack.' 'They used to pour boiling lead down on besiegers when they got too close,' said Anthea. 'Father showed me the holes on purpose for pouring it down through at Bodiam Castle. And there are holes like it in the gate-tower here.' 'I think I'm glad it's only a game; it  is  only a game, isn't it?' said Jane. But no one answered. The children found plenty of strange weapons in the castle, and if they were armed at all it was soon plain that they would be, as Cyril said, 'armed heavily', for these swords and lances and crossbows were far too weighty even for Cyril's manly strength; and as for the longbows, none of the children could even begin to bend them. The daggers were better; but Jane hoped that the besiegers would not come close enough for daggers to be of any use. 'Never mind, we can hurl them like javelins,' said Cyril, 'or drop them on people's heads. I say, there are lots of stones on the other side of the courtyard. If we took some of those up? Just to drop on their heads if they were to try swimming the moat.' So a heap of stones grew apace, up in the room above the gate; and another heap, a shiny spiky dangerous-looking heap, of daggers and knives. As Anthea was crossing the courtyard for more stones, a sudden and valuable idea came to her. She went to Martha and said, 'May we have just biscuits for tea? We're going to play at besieged castles, and we'd like the biscuits to provision the garrison. Put mine in my pocket, please, my hands are so dirty. And I'll tell the others to fetch theirs.' This was indeed a happy thought, for now with four generous handfuls of air, which turned to biscuits as Martha crammed it into their pockets, the garrison was well provisioned till sundown. They brought up some iron pots of cold water to pour on the besiegers instead of hot lead, with which the castle did not seem to be provided. The afternoon passed with wonderful quickness. It was very exciting; but none of them, except Robert, could feel all the time that this was real deadly dangerous work. To the others, who had only seen the camp and the besiegers from a distance, the whole thing seemed half a game of make-believe, and half a splendidly distinct and perfectly safe dream. But it was only now and then that Robert could feel this. When it seemed to be tea-time the biscuits were eaten, with water from the deep well in the courtyard, drunk out of horns. Cyril insisted on putting by eight of the biscuits, in case anyone should feel faint in stress of battle. Just as he was putting away the reserve biscuits in a sort of little stone cupboard without a door, a sudden sound made him drop three. It was the loud fierce cry of a trumpet. 'You see it  is  real,' said Robert, 'and they are going to attack.' All rushed to the narrow windows. 'Yes,' said Robert, 'they're all coming out of their tents and moving about like ants. There's that Jakin dancing about where the bridge joins on. I wish he could see me put my tongue out at him! Yah!' The others were far too pale to wish to put their tongues out at anybody. They looked at Robert with surprised respect. Anthea said,  'You really  are  brave, Robert.' 'Rot!' Cyril's pallor turned to redness now, all in a minute. 'He's been getting ready to be brave all the afternoon. And I wasn't ready, that's all. I shall be braver than he is in half a jiffy.' 'Oh dear!' said Jane, 'what does it matter which of you is the bravest? I think Cyril was a perfect silly to wish for a castle, and I don't want to play.' 'It  isn't ', Robert was beginning sternly, but Anthea interrupted,  'Oh yes, you do,' she said coaxingly; 'it's a very nice game, really, because they can't possibly get in, and if they do the women and children are always spared by civilised armies.' 'But are you quite, quite sure they  are  civilised?' asked Jane, panting. 'They seem to be such a long time ago.' 'Of course they are.' Anthea pointed cheerfully through the narrow window. 'Why, look at the little flags on their lances, how bright they are, and how fine the leader is! Look, that's him, isn't it, Robert?, on the gray horse.' Jane consented to look, and the scene was almost too pretty to be alarming. The green turf, the white tents, the flash of pennoned lances, the gleam of armour, and the bright colours of scarf and tunic, it was just like a splendid coloured picture. The trumpets were sounding, and when the trumpeters stopped for breath the children could hear the cling-clang of armour and the murmur of voices. A trumpeter came forward to the edge of the moat, which now seemed very much narrower than at first, and blew the longest and loudest blast they had yet heard. When the blaring noise had died away, a man who was with the trumpeter shouted,  'What ho, within there!' and his voice came plainly to the garrison in the gate-house. 'Hullo there!' Robert bellowed back at once. 'In the name of our Lord the King, and of our good lord and trusty leader Sir Wulfric de Talbot, we summon this castle to surrender, on pain of fire and sword and no quarter. Do ye surrender?' ' No ' bawled Robert; 'of course we don't! Never,  Never, NEVER !' The man answered back,  'Then your fate be on your own heads.' 'Cheer,' said Robert in a fierce whisper. 'Cheer to show them we aren't afraid, and rattle the daggers to make more noise. One, two, three! Hip, hip, hooray! Again, Hip, hip, hooray! One more, Hip, hip, hooray!' The cheers were rather high and weak, but the rattle of the daggers lent them strength and depth. There was another shout from the camp across the moat, and then the beleaguered fortress felt that the attack had indeed begun. It was getting rather dark in the room above the great gate, and Jane took a very little courage as she remembered that sunset  couldn't  be far off now. 'The moat is dreadfully thin,' said Anthea. 'But they can't get into the castle even if they do swim over,' said Robert. And as he spoke he heard feet on the stair outside, heavy feet and the clang of steel. No one breathed for a moment. The steel and the feet went on up the turret stairs. Then Robert sprang softly to the door. He pulled off his shoes. 'Wait here,' he whispered, and stole quickly and softly after the boots and the spur-clank. He peeped into the upper room. The man was there, and it was Jakin, all dripping with moat-water, and he was fiddling about with the machinery which Robert felt sure worked the drawbridge. Robert banged the door suddenly, and turned the great key in the lock, just as Jakin sprang to the inside of the door. Then he tore downstairs and into the little turret at the foot of the tower where the biggest window was. 'We ought to have defended  this !' he cried to the others as they followed him. He was just in time. Another man had swum over, and his fingers were on the window-ledge. Robert never knew how the man had managed to climb up out of the water. But he saw the clinging fingers, and hit them as hard as he could with an iron bar that he caught up from the floor. The man fell with a splash into the moat-water. In another moment Robert was outside the little room, had banged its door and was shooting home the enormous bolts, and calling to Cyril to lend a hand. [Illustration: The man fell with a splash into the moat-water] Then they stood in the arched gate-house, breathing hard and looking at each other. Jane's mouth was open. 'Cheer up, Jenny,' said Robert,, 'it won't last much longer.' There was a creaking above, and something rattled and shook. The pavement they stood on seemed to tremble. Then a crash told them that the drawbridge had been lowered to its place. 'That's that beast Jakin,' said Robert. 'There's still the portcullis; I'm almost certain that's worked from lower down.' And now the drawbridge rang and echoed hollowly to the hoofs of horses and the tramp of armed men. 'Up, quick!' cried Robert,, 'let's drop things on them.' Even the girls were feeling almost brave now. They followed Robert quickly, and under his directions began to drop stones out through the long narrow windows. There was a confused noise below, and some groans. 'Oh dear!' said Anthea, putting down the stone she was just going to drop out, 'I'm afraid we've hurt somebody!' Robert caught up the stone in a fury. 'I should hope we  had !' he said; 'I'd give something for a jolly good boiling kettle of lead. Surrender, indeed!' And now came more tramping and a pause, and then the thundering thump of the battering-ram. And the little room was almost pitch dark. 'We've held it,' cried Robert, 'we  won't  surrender! The sun  must  set in a minute. Here, they're all jawing underneath again. Pity there's no time to get more stones! Here, pour that water down on them. It's no good, of course, but they'll hate it.' 'Oh dear!' said Jane, 'don't you think we'd better surrender?' 'Never!' said Robert; 'we'll have a parley if you like, but we'll never surrender. Oh, I'll be a soldier when I grow up, you just see if I don't. I won't go into the Civil Service, whatever anyone says.' 'Let's wave a handkerchief and ask for a parley,' Jane pleaded. 'I don't believe the sun's going to set to-night at all.' 'Give them the water first, the brutes!' said the bloodthirsty Robert. So Anthea tilted the pot over the nearest lead-hole, and poured. They heard a splash below, but no one below seemed to have felt it. And again the ram battered the great door. Anthea paused. [Illustration: Anthea tilted the pot over the nearest lead-hole] 'How idiotic,' said Robert, lying flat on the floor and putting one eye to the lead-hole. 'Of course the holes go straight down into the gate-house, that's for when the enemy has got past the door and the portcullis, and almost all is lost. Here, hand me the pot.' He crawled on to the three-cornered window-ledge in the middle of the wall, and, taking the pot from Anthea, poured the water out through the arrow-slit. And as he began to pour, the noise of the battering-ram and the trampling of the foe and the shouts of 'Surrender!' and 'De Talbot for ever!' all suddenly stopped and went out like the snuff of a candle; the little dark room seemed to whirl round and turn topsy-turvy, and when the children came to themselves there they were, safe and sound, in the big front bedroom of their own house, the house with the ornamental nightmare iron-top to the roof. They all crowded to the window and looked out. The moat and the tents and the besieging force were all gone, and there was the garden with its tangle of dahlias and marigolds and asters and later roses, and the spiky iron railings and the quiet white road. Everyone drew a deep breath. 'And that's all right!' said Robert. 'I told you so! And, I say, we didn't surrender, did we?' 'Aren't you glad now I wished for a castle?' asked Cyril. 'I think I am  now ,' said Anthea slowly. 'But I wouldn't wish for it again, I think, Squirrel dear!' 'Oh, it was simply splendid!' said Jane unexpectedly. 'I wasn't frightened a bit.' 'Oh, I say!' Cyril was beginning, but Anthea stopped him. 'Look here,' she said, 'it's just come into my head. This is the very first thing we've wished for that hasn't got us into a row. And there hasn't been the least little scrap of a row about this. Nobody's raging downstairs, we're safe and sound, we've had an awfully jolly day, at least, not jolly exactly, but you know what I mean. And we know now how brave Robert is, and Cyril too, of course,' she added hastily, 'and Jane as well. And we haven't got into a row with a single grown-up.' The door was opened suddenly and fiercely. 'You ought to be ashamed of yourselves,' said the voice of Martha, and they could tell by her voice that she was very angry indeed. 'I thought you couldn't last through the day without getting up to some mischief! A person can't take a breath of air on the front doorstep but you must be emptying the water jug on their heads! Off you go to bed, the lot of you, and try to get up better children in the morning. Now then, don't let me have to tell you twice. If I find any of you not in bed in ten minutes I'll let you know it, that's all! A new cap, and everything!' She flounced out amid a disregarded chorus of regrets and apologies. The children were very sorry, but really it was not their faults. You can't help it if you are pouring water on a besieging foe, and your castle suddenly changes into your house, and everything changes with it except the water, and that happens to fall on somebody else's clean cap. 'I don't know why the water didn't change into nothing, though,' said Cyril. 'Why should it?' asked Robert. 'Water's water all the world over.' 'I expect the castle well was the same as ours in the stable-yard,' said Jane. And that was really the case. 'I thought we couldn't get through a wish-day without a row,' said Cyril; 'it was much too good to be true. Come on, Bobs, my military hero. If we lick into bed sharp she won't be so furious, and perhaps she'll bring us up some supper. I'm jolly hungry! Good-night, kids.' 'Good-night. I hope the castle won't come creeping back in the night,' said Jane. 'Of course it won't,' said Anthea briskly, 'but Martha will, not in the night, but in a minute. Here, turn round, I'll get that knot out of your pinafore strings.' 'Wouldn't it have been degrading for Sir Wulfric de Talbot,' said Jane dreamily, 'if he could have known that half the besieged garrison wore pinafores?' 'And the other half knickerbockers. Yes, frightfully. Do stand still, you're only tightening the knot,' said Anthea. CHAPTER VIII BIGGER THAN THE BAKER'S BOY 'Look here,' said Cyril. 'I've got an idea.' 'Does it hurt much?' said Robert sympathetically. 'Don't be a jackanape! I'm not humbugging.' 'Shut up, Bobs!' said Anthea. 'Silence for the Squirrel's oration,' said Robert. Cyril balanced himself on the edge of the water-butt in the backyard, where they all happened to be, and spoke. 'Friends, Romans, countrymen, and women, we found a Sammyadd. We have had wishes. We've had wings, and being beautiful as the day, ugh!, that was pretty jolly beastly if you like, and wealth and castles, and that rotten gipsy business with the Lamb. But we're no forrarder. We haven't really got anything worth having for our wishes.' 'We've had things happening,' said Robert; 'that's always something.' 'It's not enough, unless they're the right things,' said Cyril firmly. 'Now I've been thinking',  'Not really?' whispered Robert. 'In the silent what's-its-names of the night. It's like suddenly being asked something out of history, the date of the Conquest or something; you know it all right all the time, but when you're asked it all goes out of your head. Ladies and gentlemen, you know jolly well that when we're all rotting about in the usual way heaps of things keep cropping up, and then real earnest wishes come into the heads of the beholder',  'Hear, hear!' said Robert. ', of the beholder, however, stupid he is,' Cyril went on. 'Why, even Robert might happen to think of a really useful wish if he didn't injure his poor little brains trying so hard to think., Shut up, Bobs, I tell you!, You'll have the whole show over.' A struggle on the edge of a water-butt is exciting but damp. When it was over, and the boys were partially dried, Anthea said,  'It really was you began it, Bobs. Now honour is satisfied, do let Squirrel go on. We're wasting the whole morning.' 'Well then,' said Cyril, still wringing the water out of the tails of his jacket, 'I'll call it pax if Bobs will.' 'Pax then,' said Robert sulkily. 'But I've got a lump as big as a cricket ball over my eye.' Anthea patiently offered a dust-coloured handkerchief, and Robert bathed his wounds in silence. 'Now, Squirrel,' she said. 'Well then, let's just play bandits, or forts, or soldiers, or any of the old games. We're dead sure to think of something if we try not to. You always do.' The others consented. Bandits was hastily chosen for the game. 'It's as good as anything else,' said Jane gloomily. It must be owned that Robert was at first but a half-hearted bandit, but when Anthea had borrowed from Martha the red-spotted handkerchief in which the keeper had brought her mushrooms that morning, and had tied up Robert's head with it so that he could be the wounded hero who had saved the bandit captain's life the day before, he cheered up wonderfully. All were soon armed. Bows and arrows slung on the back look well; and umbrellas and cricket stumps through the belt give a fine impression of the wearer's being armed to the teeth. The white cotton hats that men wear in the country nowadays have a very brigandish effect when a few turkey's feathers are stuck in them. The Lamb's mail-cart was covered with a red-and-blue checked table-cloth, and made an admirable baggage-wagon. The Lamb asleep inside it was not at all in the way. So the banditti set out along the road that led to the sand-pit. 'We ought to be near the Sammyadd,' said Cyril, 'in case we think of anything suddenly.' It is all very well to make up your minds to play bandit, or chess, or ping-pong, or any other agreeable game, but it is not easy to do it with spirit when all the wonderful wishes you can think of, or can't think of, are waiting for you round the corner. The game was dragging a little, and some of the bandits were beginning to feel that the others were disagreeable things, and were saying so candidly, when the baker's boy came along the road with loaves in a basket. The opportunity was not one to be lost. 'Stand and deliver!' cried Cyril. 'Your money or your life!' said Robert. And they stood on each side of the baker's boy. Unfortunately, he did not seem to enter into the spirit of the thing at all. He was a baker's boy of an unusually large size. He merely said,  'Chuck it now, d'ye hear!' and pushed the bandits aside most disrespectfully. Then Robert lassoed him with Jane's skipping-rope, and instead of going round his shoulders, as Robert intended, it went round his feet and tripped him up. The basket was upset, the beautiful new loaves went bumping and bouncing all over the dusty chalky road. The girls ran to pick them up, and all in a moment Robert and the baker's boy were fighting it out, man to man, with Cyril to see fair play, and the skipping-rope twisting round their legs like an interesting snake that wished to be a peace-maker. It did not succeed; indeed the way the boxwood handles sprang up and hit the fighters on the shins and ankles was not at all peace-making. I know this is the second fight, or contest, in this chapter, but I can't help it. It was that sort of day. You know yourself there are days when rows seem to keep on happening, quite without your meaning them to. If I were a writer of tales of adventure such as those which used to appear in  The Boys of England  when I was young of course I should be able to describe the fight, but I cannot do it. I never can see what happens during a fight, even when it is only dogs. Also, if I had been one of these  Boys of England  writers, Robert would have got the best of it. But I am like George Washington, I cannot tell a lie, even about a cherry-tree, much less about a fight, and I cannot conceal from you that Robert was badly beaten, for the second time that day. The baker's boy blacked his other eye, and being ignorant of the first rules of fair play and gentlemanly behaviour, he also pulled Robert's hair, and kicked him on the knee. Robert always used to say he could have licked the baker if it hadn't been for the girls. But I am not sure. Anyway, what happened was this, and very painful it was to self-respecting boys. [Illustration: He pulled Robert's hair] Cyril was just tearing off his coat so as to help his brother in proper style, when Jane threw her arms round his legs and began to cry and ask him not to go and be beaten too. That 'too' was very nice for Robert, as you can imagine, but it was nothing to what he felt when Anthea rushed in between him and the baker's boy, and caught that unfair and degraded fighter round the waist, imploring him not to fight any more. 'Oh, don't hurt my brother any more!' she said in floods of tears. 'He didn't mean it, it's only play. And I'm sure he's very sorry.' You see how unfair this was to Robert. Because, if the baker's boy had had any right and chivalrous instincts, and had yielded to Anthea's pleading and accepted her despicable apology, Robert could not, in honour, have done anything to him at any future time. But Robert's fears, if he had any, were soon dispelled. Chivalry was a stranger to the breast of the baker's boy. He pushed Anthea away very roughly, and he chased Robert with kicks and unpleasant conversation right down the road to the sand-pit, and there, with one last kick, he landed him in a heap of sand. 'I'll larn you, you young varmint!' he said, and went off to pick up his loaves and go about his business. Cyril, impeded by Jane, could do nothing without hurting her, for she clung round his legs with the strength of despair. The baker's boy went off red and damp about the face; abusive to the last, he called them a pack of silly idiots, and disappeared round the corner. Then Jane's grasp loosened. Cyril turned away in silent dignity to follow Robert, and the girls followed him, weeping without restraint. It was not a happy party that flung itself down in the sand beside the sobbing Robert. For Robert was sobbing, mostly with rage. Though of course I know that a really heroic boy is always dry-eyed after a fight. But then he always wins, which had not been the case with Robert. Cyril was angry with Jane; Robert was furious with Anthea; the girls were miserable; and not one of the four was pleased with the baker's boy. There was, as French writers say, 'a silence full of emotion.' Then Robert dug his toes and his hands into the sand and wriggled in his rage. 'He'd better wait till I'm grown up, the cowardly brute! Beast!, I hate him! But I'll pay him out. Just because he's bigger than me.' 'You began,' said Jane incautiously. 'I know I did, silly, but I was only jollying, and he kicked me, look here',  Robert tore down a stocking and showed a purple bruise touched up with red. 'I only wish I was bigger than him, that's all.' He dug his fingers in the sand, and sprang up, for his hand had touched something furry. It was the Psammead, of course, 'On the look-out to make sillies of them as usual,' as Cyril remarked later. And of course the next moment Robert's wish was granted, and he was bigger than the baker's boy. Oh, but much, much bigger! He was bigger than the big policeman who used to be at the crossing at the Mansion House years ago,, the one who was so kind in helping old ladies over the crossing,, and he was the biggest man  I  have ever seen, as well as the kindest. No one had a foot-rule in its pocket, so Robert could not be measured, but he was taller than your father would be if he stood on your mother's head, which I am sure he would never be unkind enough to do. He must have been ten or eleven feet high, and as broad as a boy of that height ought to be. His suit had fortunately grown too, and now he stood up in it, with one of his enormous stockings turned down to show the gigantic bruise on his vast leg. Immense tears of fury still stood on his flushed giant face. He looked so surprised, and he was so large to be wearing a turned down collar outside of his jacket that the others could not help laughing. 'The Sammyadd's done us again,' said Cyril. [Illustration: 'The Sammyadd's done us again,' said Cyril] 'Not us,  me ,' said Robert. 'If you'd got any decent feeling you'd try to make it make you the same size. You've no idea how silly it feels,' he added thoughtlessly. 'And I don't want to; I can jolly well see how silly it looks,' Cyril was beginning; but Anthea said,  'Oh,  don't ! I don't know what's the matter with you boys to-day. Look here, Squirrel, let's play fair. It is hateful for poor old Bobs, all alone up there. Let's ask the Sammyadd for another wish, and, if it will, I do really think we ought all to be made the same size.' The others agreed, but not gaily; but when they found the Psammead, it wouldn't. 'Not I,' it said crossly, rubbing its face with its feet. 'He's a rude violent boy, and it'll do him good to be the wrong size for a bit. What did he want to come digging me out with his nasty wet hands for? He nearly touched me! He's a perfect savage. A boy of the Stone Age would have had more sense.' Robert's hands had indeed been wet, with tears. 'Go away and leave me in peace, do,' the Psammead went on. 'I can't think why you don't wish for something sensible, something to eat or drink, or good manners, or good tempers. Go along with you, do!' It almost snarled as it shook its whiskers, and turned a sulky brown back on them. The most hopeful felt that further parley was vain. They turned again to the colossal Robert. 'What ever shall we do?' they said; and they all said it. 'First,' said Robert grimly, 'I'm going to reason with that baker's boy. I shall catch him at the end of the road.' 'Don't hit a chap smaller than yourself, old man,' said Cyril. 'Do I look like hitting him?' said Robert scornfully. 'Why, I should  kill  him. But I'll give him something to remember. Wait till I pull up my stocking.' He pulled up his stocking, which was as large as a small bolster-case, and strode off. His strides were six or seven feet long, so that it was quite easy for him to be at the bottom of the hill, ready to meet the baker's boy when he came down swinging the empty basket to meet his master's cart, which had been leaving bread at the cottages along the road. Robert crouched behind a haystack in the farmyard, that is at the corner, and when he heard the boy come whistling along he jumped out at him and caught him by the collar. 'Now,' he said, and his voice was about four times its usual size, just as his body was four times its, 'I'm going to teach you to kick boys smaller than you.' He lifted up the baker's boy and set him on the top of the haystack, which was about sixteen feet from the ground, and then he sat down on the roof of the barn and told the baker's boy exactly what he thought of him. I don't think the boy heard it all, he was in a sort of trance of terror. When Robert had said everything he could think of, and some things twice over, he shook the boy and said,  [Illustration: He lifted up the baker's boy and set him on top of the haystack] 'And now get down the best way you can,' and left him. I don't know how the baker's boy got down, but I do know that he missed the cart and got into the very hottest of hot water when he turned up at last at the bakehouse. I am sorry for him, but after all, it was quite right that he should be taught that boys mustn't use their feet when they fight, but their fists. Of course the water he got into only became hotter when he tried to tell his master about the boy he had licked and the giant as high as a church, because no one could possibly believe such a tale as that. Next day the tale was believed, but that was too late to be of any use to the baker's boy. When Robert rejoined the others he found them in the garden. Anthea had thoughtfully asked Martha to let them have dinner out there, because the dining-room was rather small, and it would have been so awkward to have a brother the size of Robert in there. The Lamb, who had slept peacefully during the whole stormy morning, was now found to be sneezing, and Martha said he had a cold and would be better indoors. 'And really it's just as well,' said Cyril, 'for I don't believe he'd ever have stopped screaming if he'd once seen you, the awful size you are!' Robert was indeed what a draper would call an 'out-size' in boys. He found himself able to step right over the iron gate in the front garden. Martha brought out the dinner, it was cold veal and baked potatoes, with sago pudding and stewed plums to follow. She of course did not notice that Robert was anything but the usual size, and she gave him as much meat and potatoes as usual and no more. You have no idea how small your usual helping of dinner looks when you are many times your proper size. Robert groaned, and asked for more bread. But Martha would not go on giving more bread for ever. She was in a hurry, because the keeper intended to call on his way to Benenhurst Fair, and she wished to be smartly dressed before he came. 'I wish  we  were going to the Fair,' said Robert. 'You can't go anywhere that size,' said Cyril. 'Why not?' said Robert. 'They have giants at fairs, much bigger ones than me.' 'Not much, they don't,' Cyril was beginning, when Jane screamed 'Oh!' with such loud suddenness that they all thumped her on the back and asked whether she had swallowed a plum-stone. 'No,' she said, breathless from being thumped, 'it's, it's not a plum-stone. It's an idea. Let's take Robert to the Fair, and get them to give us money for showing him! Then we really  shall  get something out of the old Sammyadd at last!' 'Take me, indeed!' said Robert indignantly. 'Much more likely me take you!' And so it turned out. The idea appealed irresistibly to everyone but Robert, and even he was brought round by Anthea's suggestion that he should have a double share of any money they might make. There was a little old pony-cart in the coach-house, the kind that is called a governess-cart. It seemed desirable to get to the Fair as quickly as possible, so Robert, who could now take enormous steps and so go very fast indeed, consented to wheel the others in this. It was as easy to him now as wheeling the Lamb in the mail-cart had been in the morning. The Lamb's cold prevented his being of the party. It was a strange sensation being wheeled in a pony-carriage by a giant. Everyone enjoyed the journey except Robert and the few people they passed on the way. These mostly went into what looked like some kind of standing-up fits by the roadside, as Anthea said. Just outside Benenhurst, Robert hid in a barn, and the others went on to the Fair. [Illustration: It was a strange sensation being wheeled in a pony-carriage by a giant] There were some swings, and a hooting-tooting blaring merry-go-round, and a shooting-gallery and Aunt Sallies. Resisting an impulse to win a cocoanut,, or at least to attempt the enterprise,, Cyril went up to the woman who was loading little guns before the array of glass bottles on strings against a sheet of canvas. 'Here you are, little gentleman!' she said. 'Penny a shot!' 'No, thank you,' said Cyril, 'we are here on business, not on pleasure. Who's the master?' 'The what?' 'The master, the head, the boss of the show.' 'Over there,' she said, pointing to a stout man in a dirty linen jacket who was sleeping in the sun; 'but I don't advise you to wake him sudden. His temper's contrairy, especially these hot days. Better have a shot while you're waiting.' 'It's rather important,' said Cyril. 'It'll be very profitable to him. I think he'll be sorry if we take it away.' 'Oh, if it's money in his pocket,' said the woman. 'No kid now? What is it?' 'It's a  giant .' 'You  are  kidding?' 'Come along and see,' said Anthea. The woman looked doubtfully at them, then she called to a ragged little girl in striped stockings and a dingy white petticoat that came below her brown frock, and leaving her in charge of the 'shooting-gallery' she turned to Anthea and said, 'Well, hurry up! But if you  are  kidding, you'd best say so. I'm as mild as milk myself, but my Bill he's a fair terror and',  Anthea led the way to the barn. 'It really  is  a giant,' she said. 'He's a giant little boy, in a suit like my brother's there. And we didn't bring him up to the Fair because people do stare so, and they seem to go into kind of standing-up fits when they see him. And we thought perhaps you'd like to show him and get pennies; and if you like to pay us something, you can, only, it'll have to be rather a lot, because we promised him he should have a double share of whatever we made.' The woman murmured something indistinct, of which the children could only hear the words, 'Swelp me!' 'balmy,' and 'crumpet,' which conveyed no definite idea to their minds. She had taken Anthea's hand, and was holding it very firmly; and Anthea could not help wondering what would happen if Robert should have wandered off or turned his proper size during the interval. But she knew that the Psammead's gifts really did last till sunset, however inconvenient their lasting might be; and she did not think, somehow, that Robert would care to go out alone while he was that size. When they reached the barn and Cyril called 'Robert!' there was a stir among the loose hay, and Robert began to come out. His hand and arm came first, then a foot and leg. When the woman saw the hand she said 'My!' but when she saw the foot she said 'Upon my word!' and when, by slow and heavy degrees, the whole of Robert's enormous bulk was at last disclosed, she drew a long breath and began to say many things, compared with which 'balmy' and 'crumpet' seemed quite ordinary. She dropped into understandable English at last. 'What'll you take for him?' she said excitedly. 'Anything in reason. We'd have a special van built, leastways, I know where there's a second-hand one would do up handsome, what a baby elephant had, as died. What'll you take? He's soft, ain't he? Them giants mostly is, but I never see, no, never! What'll you take? Down on the nail. We'll treat him like a king, and give him first-rate grub and a doss fit for a bloomin' dook. He must be dotty or he wouldn't need you kids to cart him about. What'll you take for him?' 'They won't take anything,' said Robert sternly. 'I'm no more soft than you are, not so much, I shouldn't wonder. I'll come and be a show for to-day if you'll give me,', he hesitated at the enormous price he was about to ask,, 'if you'll give me fifteen shillings.' 'Done,' said the woman, so quickly that Robert felt he had been unfair to himself, and wished he had asked thirty. 'Come on now, and see my Bill, and we'll fix a price for the season. I dessay you might get as much as two pounds a week reg'lar. Come on, and make yourself as small as you can for gracious' sake!' This was not very small, and a crowd gathered quickly, so that it was at the head of an enthusiastic procession that Robert entered the trampled meadow where the Fair was held, and passed over the stubby yellow dusty grass to the door of the biggest tent. He crept in, and the woman went to call her Bill. He was the big sleeping man, and he did not seem at all pleased at being awakened. Cyril, watching through a slit in the tent, saw him scowl and shake a heavy fist and a sleepy head. Then the woman went on speaking very fast. Cyril heard 'Strewth,' and 'biggest draw you ever, so help me!' and he began to share Robert's feeling that fifteen shillings was indeed far too little. Bill slouched up to the tent and entered. When he beheld the magnificent proportions of Robert he said but little,, 'Strike me pink!' were the only words the children could afterwards remember,, but he produced fifteen shillings, mainly in sixpences and coppers, and handed it to Robert. 'We'll fix up about what you're to draw when the show's over to-night,' he said with hoarse heartiness. 'Lor' love a duck! you'll be that happy with us you'll never want to leave us. Can you do a song now, or a bit of a breakdown?' 'Not to-day,' said Robert, rejecting the idea of trying to sing 'As once in May,' a favourite of his mother's, and the only song he could think of at the moment. 'Get Levi and clear them bloomin' photos out. Clear the tent. Stick out a curtain or suthink,' the man went on. 'Lor', what a pity we ain't got no tights his size! But we'll have 'em before the week's out. Young man, your fortune's made. It's a good thing you came to me, and not to some chaps as I could tell you on. I've known blokes as beat their giants, and starved 'em too; so I'll tell you straight, you're in luck this day if you never was afore. 'Cos I'm a lamb, I am, and I don't deceive you.' 'I'm not afraid of anyone beating me,' said Robert, looking down on the 'lamb.' Robert was crouched on his knees, because the tent was not big enough for him to stand upright in, but even in that position he could still look down on most people. 'But I'm awfully hungry, I wish you'd get me something to eat.' 'Here, 'Becca,' said the hoarse Bill. 'Get him some grub, the best you've got, mind!' Another whisper followed, of which the children only heard, 'Down in black and white, first thing to-morrow.' Then the woman went to get the food, it was only bread and cheese when it came, but it was delightful to the large and empty Robert; and the man went to post sentinels round the tent, to give the alarm if Robert should attempt to escape with his fifteen shillings. 'As if we weren't honest,' said Anthea indignantly when the meaning of the sentinels dawned on her. Then began a very strange and wonderful afternoon. Bill was a man who knew his business. In a very little while, the photographic views, the spyglasses you look at them through so that they really seem rather real, and the lights you see them by, were all packed away. A curtain, it was an old red-and-black carpet really, was run across the tent. Robert was concealed behind, and Bill was standing on a trestle-table outside the tent making a speech. It was rather a good speech. It began by saying that the giant it was his privilege to introduce to the public that day was the eldest son of the Emperor of San Francisco, compelled through an unfortunate love affair with the Duchess of the Fiji Islands to leave his own country and take refuge in England, the land of liberty, where freedom was the right of every man, no matter how big he was. It ended by the announcement that the first twenty who came to the tent door should see the giant for threepence apiece. 'After that,' said Bill, 'the price is riz, and I don't undertake to say what it won't be riz to. So now's yer time.' A young man with his sweetheart on her afternoon out was the first to come forward. For this occasion his was the princely attitude, no expense spared, money no object. His girl wished to see the giant? Well, she should see the giant, even though seeing the giant cost threepence each and the other entertainments were all penny ones. The flap of the tent was raised, the couple entered. Next moment a wild shriek from the girl thrilled through all present. Bill slapped his leg. 'That's done the trick!' he whispered to 'Becca. It was indeed a splendid advertisement of the charms of Robert. When the young girl came out she was pale and trembling, and a crowd was round the tent. [Illustration: When the girl came out she was pale and trembling] 'What was it like?' asked a farm-hand. 'Oh!, horrid!, you wouldn't believe,' she said. 'It's as big as a barn, and that fierce. It froze the blood in my bones. I wouldn't ha' missed seeing it for anything.' The fierceness was only caused by Robert's trying not to laugh. But the desire to do that soon left him, and before sunset he was more inclined to cry than laugh, and more inclined to sleep than either. For, by ones and twos and threes, people kept coming in all the afternoon, and Robert had to shake hands with those who wished it, and to allow himself to be punched and pulled and patted and thumped, so that people might make sure he was really real. The other children sat on a bench and watched and waited, and were very bored indeed. It seemed to them that this was the hardest way of earning money that could have been invented. And only fifteen shillings! Bill had taken four times that already, for the news of the giant had spread, and trades-people in carts, and gentlepeople in carriages, came from far and near. One gentleman with an eyeglass, and a very large yellow rose in his buttonhole, offered Robert, in an obliging whisper, ten pounds a week to appear at the Crystal Palace. Robert had to say 'No.' 'I can't,' he said regretfully. 'It's no use promising what you can't do.' 'Ah, poor fellow, bound for a term of years, I suppose! Well, here's my card; when your time's up come to me.' [Illustration: 'When your time's up come to me'] 'I will, if I'm the same size then,' said Robert truthfully. 'If you grow a bit, so much the better,' said the gentleman. When he had gone, Robert beckoned Cyril and said,  'Tell them I must and will have a rest. And I want my tea.' Tea was provided, and a paper hastily pinned on the tent. It said,              CLOSED FOR HALF AN HOUR           WHILE THE GIANT GETS HIS TEA Then there was a hurried council. 'How am I to get away?' said Robert. 'I've been thinking about it all the afternoon.' 'Why, walk out when the sun sets and you're your right size. They can't do anything to us.' Robert opened his eyes. 'Why, they'd nearly kill us,' he said, 'when they saw me get my right size. No, we must think of some other way. We  must  be alone when the sun sets.' 'I know,' said Cyril briskly, and he went to the door, outside which Bill was smoking a clay pipe and talking in a low voice to 'Becca. Cyril heard him say, 'Good as havin' a fortune left you.' 'Look here,' said Cyril, 'you can let people come in again in a minute. He's nearly finished tea. But he  must  be left alone when the sun sets. He's very queer at that time of day, and if he's worried I won't answer for the consequences.' 'Why, what comes over him?' asked Bill. 'I don't know; it's, it's sort of a  change ,' said Cyril candidly. 'He isn't at all like himself, you'd hardly know him. He's very queer indeed. Someone'll get hurt if he's not alone about sunset.' This was true. 'He'll pull round for the evening, I s'pose?' 'Oh yes, half an hour after sunset he'll be quite himself again.' 'Best humour him,' said the woman. And so, at what Cyril judged was about half an hour before sunset, the tent was again closed 'whilst the giant gets his supper.' The crowd was very merry about the giant's meals and their coming so close together. 'Well, he can pick a bit,' Bill owned. 'You see he has to eat hearty, being the size he is.' Inside the tent the four children breathlessly arranged a plan of retreat. 'You go  now ,' said Cyril to the girls, 'and get along home as fast as you can. Oh, never mind the pony-cart; we'll get that to-morrow. Robert and I are dressed the same. We'll manage somehow, like Sydney Carton did. Only, you girls  must  get out, or it's all no go. We can run, but you can't, whatever you may think. No, Jane, it's no good Robert going out and knocking people down. The police would follow him till he turned his proper size, and then arrest him like a shot. Go you must! If you don't, I'll never speak to you again. It was you got us into this mess really, hanging round people's legs the way you did this morning.  Go , I tell you!' And Jane and Anthea went. 'We're going home,' they said to Bill. 'We're leaving the giant with you. Be kind to him.' And that, as Anthea said afterwards, was very deceitful, but what were they to do? When they had gone, Cyril went to Bill. 'Look here,' he said, 'he wants some ears of corn, there's some in the next field but one. I'll just run and get it. Oh, and he says can't you loop up the tent at the back a bit? He says he's stifling for a breath of air. I'll see no one peeps in at him. I'll cover him up, and he can take a nap while I go for the corn. He  will  have it, there's no holding him when he gets like this.' The giant was made comfortable with a heap of sacks and an old tarpaulin. The curtain was looped up, and the brothers were left alone. They matured their plan in whispers. Outside, the merry-go-round blared out its comic tunes, screaming now and then to attract public notice. Half a minute after the sun had set, a boy came out past Bill. 'I'm off for the corn,' he said, and mingled quickly with the crowd. At the same instant a boy came out of the back of the tent past 'Becca, posted there as sentinel. 'I'm off after the corn,' said this boy also. And he, too, moved away quietly and was lost in the crowd. The front-door boy was Cyril; the back-door was Robert, now, since sunset, once more his proper size. They walked quickly through the field, along the road, where Robert caught Cyril up. Then they ran. They were home as soon as the girls were, for it was a long way, and they ran most of it. It was indeed a  very  long way, as they found when they had to go and drag the pony-cart home next morning, with no enormous Robert to wheel them in it as if it were a mail-cart, and they were babies and he was their gigantic nursemaid.                                          I cannot possibly tell you what Bill and 'Becca said when they found that the giant had gone. For one thing, I do not know. CHAPTER IX GROWN UP Cyril had once pointed out that ordinary life is full of occasions on which a wish would be most useful. And this thought filled his mind when he happened to wake early on the morning after the morning after Robert had wished to be bigger than the baker's boy, and had been it. The day that lay between these two days had been occupied entirely by getting the governess-cart home from Benenhurst. Cyril dressed hastily; he did not take a bath, because tin baths are so noisy, and he had no wish to rouse Robert, and he slipped off alone, as Anthea had once done, and ran through the dewy morning to the sand-pit. He dug up the Psammead very carefully and kindly, and began the conversation by asking it whether it still felt any ill effects from the contact with the tears of Robert the day before yesterday. The Psammead was in good temper. It replied politely. 'And now, what can I do for you?' it said. 'I suppose you've come here so early to ask for something for yourself, something your brothers and sisters aren't to know about, eh? Now, do be persuaded for your own good! Ask for a good fat Megatherium and have done with it.' 'Thank you, not to-day, I think,' said Cyril cautiously. 'What I really wanted to say was, you know how you're always wishing for things when you're playing at anything?' 'I seldom play,' said the Psammead coldly. 'Well, you know what I mean,' Cyril went on impatiently. 'What I want to say is: won't you let us have our wish just when we think of it, and just where we happen to be? So that we don't have to come and disturb you again,' added the crafty Cyril. 'It'll only end in your wishing for something you don't really want, as you did about the castle,' said the Psammead, stretching its brown arms and yawning. 'It's always the same since people left off eating really wholesome things. However, have it your own way. Good-bye.' 'Good-bye,' said Cyril politely. 'I'll tell you what,' said the Psammead suddenly, shooting out its long snail's eyes,, 'I'm getting tired of you, all of you. You have no more sense than so many oysters. Go along with you!' And Cyril went. 'What an awful long time babies  stay  babies,' said Cyril after the Lamb had taken his watch out of his pocket while he wasn't noticing, and with coos and clucks of naughty rapture had opened the case and used the whole thing as a garden spade, and when even immersion in a wash basin had failed to wash the mould from the works and make the watch go again. Cyril had said several things in the heat of the moment; but now he was calmer, and had even consented to carry the Lamb part of the way to the woods. Cyril had persuaded the others to agree to his plan, and not to wish for anything more till they really did wish it. Meantime it seemed good to go to the woods for nuts, and on the mossy grass under a sweet chestnut tree the five were sitting. The Lamb was pulling up the moss by fat handfuls, and Cyril was gloomily contemplating the ruins of his watch. [Illustration: He opened the case and used the whole thing as a garden spade] 'He does grow,' said Anthea. 'Doesn't 'oo, precious?' 'Me grow,' said the Lamb cheerfully, 'me grow big boy, have guns' an' mouses, an', an'', ,  Imagination or vocabulary gave out here. But anyway it was the longest speech the Lamb had ever made, and it charmed everyone, even Cyril, who tumbled the Lamb over and rolled him in the moss to the music of delighted squeals. 'I suppose he'll be grown up some day,' Anthea was saying, dreamily looking up at the blue of the sky that showed between the long straight chestnut-leaves. But at that moment the Lamb, struggling gaily with Cyril, thrust a stout-shod little foot against his brother's chest; there was a crack!, the innocent Lamb had broken the glass of father's second-best Waterbury watch, which Cyril had borrowed without leave. 'Grow up some day!' said Cyril bitterly, plumping the Lamb down on the grass. 'I daresay he will, when nobody wants him to. I wish to goodness he would',  ' Oh , take care!' cried Anthea in an agony of apprehension. But it was too late, like music to a song her words and Cyril's came out together,  Anthea, 'Oh, take care!' Cyril, 'Grow up now!' The faithful Psammead was true to its promise, and there, before the horrified eyes of its brothers and sisters, the Lamb suddenly and violently grew up. It was the most terrible moment. The change was not so sudden as the wish-changes usually were. The Baby's face changed first. It grew thinner and larger, lines came in the forehead, the eyes grew more deep-set and darker in colour, the mouth grew longer and thinner; most terrible of all, a little dark mustache appeared on the lip of one who was still, except as to the face, a two-year-old baby in a linen smock and white open-work socks. 'Oh, I wish it wouldn't! Oh, I wish it wouldn't! You boys might wish as well!' They all wished hard, for the sight was enough to dismay the most heartless. They all wished so hard, indeed, that they felt quite giddy and almost lost consciousness; but the wishing was quite vain, for, when the wood ceased to whirl round, their dazed eyes were riveted at once by the spectacle of a very proper-looking young man in flannels and a straw hat, a young man who wore the same little black mustache which just before they had actually seen growing upon the Baby's lip. This, then, was the Lamb, grown up! Their own Lamb! It was a terrible moment. The grown-up Lamb moved gracefully across the moss and settled himself against the trunk of the sweet chestnut. He tilted the straw hat over his eyes. He was evidently weary. He was going to sleep. The Lamb, the original little tiresome beloved Lamb often went to sleep at odd times and in unexpected places. Was this new Lamb in the grey flannel suit and the pale green necktie like the other Lamb? or had his mind grown up together with his body? That was the question which the others, in a hurried council held among the yellowing brake-fern a few yards from the sleeper, debated eagerly. 'Whichever it is, it'll be just as awful,' said Anthea. 'If his inside senses are grown up too, he won't stand our looking after him; and if he's still a baby inside of him how on earth are we to get him to do anything? And it'll be getting on for dinner-time in a minute.' 'And we haven't got any nuts,' said Jane. 'Oh bother nuts!' said Robert, 'but dinner's different, I didn't have half enough dinner yesterday. Couldn't we tie him to the tree and go home to our dinner and come back afterwards?' 'A fat lot of dinner we should get if we went back without the Lamb!' said Cyril in scornful misery. 'And it'll be just the same if we go back with him in the state he is now. Yes, I know it's my doing; don't rub it in! I know I'm a beast, and not fit to live; you can take that for settled, and say no more about it. The question is, what are we going to do?' 'Let's wake him up, and take him into Rochester or Maidstone and get something to eat at a baker's shop,' said Robert hopefully. 'Take him?' repeated Cyril. 'Yes, do! It's all my fault, I don't deny that, but you'll find you've got your work cut out for you if you try to take that young man anywhere. The Lamb always was spoilt, but now he's grown up he's a demon, simply. I can see it. Look at his mouth.' 'Well then,' said Robert, 'let's wake him up and see what  he'll  do. Perhaps  he'll  take  us  to Maidstone and stand treat. He ought to have a lot of money in the pockets of those extra-special pants. We  must  have dinner, anyway.' They drew lots with little bits of brake fern. It fell to Jane's lot to waken the grown-up Lamb. She did it gently by tickling his nose with a twig of honeysuckle. He said 'Bother the flies!' twice, and then opened his eyes. [Illustration: She did it gently by tickling his nose with a twig of honeysuckle] 'Hullo, kiddies!' he said in a languid tone, 'still here? What's the giddy hour? You'll be late for your grub!' 'I know we shall,' said Robert bitterly. 'Then cut along home,' said the grown-up Lamb. 'What about your grub, though?' asked Jane. 'Oh, how far is it to the station, do you think? I've a sort of a notion that I'll run up to town and have some lunch at the club.' Blank misery fell like a pall on the four others. The Lamb, alone, unattended, would go to town and have lunch at a club! Perhaps he would also have tea there. Perhaps sunset would come upon him amid the dazzling luxury of club-land, and a helpless cross sleepy baby would find itself alone amid unsympathetic waiters, and would wail miserably for 'Panty' from the depths of a club arm-chair! The picture moved Anthea almost to tears. 'Oh no, Lamb ducky, you mustn't do that!' she cried incautiously. The grown-up Lamb frowned. 'My dear Anthea,' he said, 'how often am I to tell you that my name is Hilary or St. Maur or Devereux?, any of my baptismal names are free to my little brothers and sisters, but  not  'Lamb', a relic of foolishness and far-off childhood.' This was awful. He was their elder brother now, was he? Well of course he was, if he was grown-up, since they weren't. Thus, in whispers, Anthea and Robert. But the almost daily adventures resulting from the Psammead's wishes were making the children wise beyond their years. 'Dear Hilary,' said Anthea, and the others choked at the name, 'you know father didn't wish you to go to London. He wouldn't like us to be left alone without you to take care of us. Oh, deceitful thing that I am!' she added to herself. 'Look here,' said Cyril, 'if you're our elder brother, why not behave as sich and take us over to Maidstone and give us a jolly good blow-out, and we'll go on the river afterwards?' 'I'm infinitely obliged to you,' said the Lamb courteously, 'but I should prefer solitude. Go home to your lunch, I mean your dinner. Perhaps I may look in about tea-time, or I may not be home till after you are in your beds.' Their beds! Speaking glances flashed between the wretched four. Much bed there would be for them if they went home without the Lamb. 'We promised mother not to lose sight of you if we took you out,' Jane said before the others could stop her. 'Look here, Jane,' said the grown-up Lamb, putting his hands in his pockets and looking down at her, 'little girls should be seen and not heard. You kids must learn not to make yourselves a nuisance. Run along home now, and perhaps, if you're good, I'll give you each a penny to-morrow.' 'Look here,' said Cyril, in the best 'man to man' tone at his command, 'where are you going, old man? You might let Bobs and me come with you, even if you don't want the girls.' This was really rather noble of Cyril, for he never did care much about being seen in public with the Lamb, who of course after sunset would be a baby again. The 'man to man' tone succeeded. 'I shall run over to Maidstone on my bike,' said the new Lamb airily, fingering the little black mustache. 'I can lunch at The Crown, and perhaps I'll have a pull on the river; but I can't take you all on the machine, now, can I? Run along home, like good children.' The position was desperate. Robert exchanged a despairing look with Cyril. Anthea detached a pin from her waistband, a pin whose withdrawal left a gaping chasm between skirt and bodice, and handed it furtively to Robert, with a grimace of the darkest and deepest meaning. Robert slipped away to the road. There, sure enough, stood a bicycle, a beautiful new one. Of course Robert understood at once that if the Lamb was grown up he  must  have a bicycle. [Illustration: There, sure enough, stood a bicycle] This had always been one of Robert's own reasons for wishing to be grown-up. He hastily began to use the pin, eleven punctures in the back tyre, seven in the front. He would have made the total twenty-two but for the rustling of the yellow hazel-leaves, which warned him of the approach of the others. He hastily leaned a hand on each wheel, and was rewarded by the 'whish' of the what was left of air escaping from eighteen neat pin-holes. 'Your bike's run down,' said Robert, wondering how he could so soon have learned to deceive. 'So it is,' said Cyril. 'It's a puncture,' said Anthea, stooping down, and standing up again with a thorn which she had got ready for the purpose. 'Look here.' The grown-up Lamb (or Hilary, as I suppose one must now call him) fixed his pump and blew up the tyre. The punctured state of it was soon evident. [Illustration: The punctured state of it was soon evident] 'I suppose there's a cottage somewhere near, where one could get a pail of water?' said the Lamb. There was; and when the number of punctures had been made manifest, it was felt to be a special blessing that the cottage provided 'teas for cyclists.' It provided an odd sort of tea-and-hammy meal for the Lamb and his brothers. This was paid for out of the fifteen shillings which had been earned by Robert when he was a giant, for the Lamb, it appeared, had unfortunately no money about him. This was a great disappointment for the others; but it is a thing that will happen, even to the most grown-up of us. However, Robert had enough to eat, and that was something. Quietly but persistently the miserable four took it in turns to try and persuade the Lamb (or St. Maur) to spend the rest of the day in the woods. There was not very much of the day left by the time he had mended the eighteenth puncture. He looked up from the completed work with a sigh of relief, and suddenly put his tie straight. 'There's a lady coming,' he said briskly,, 'for goodness' sake, get out of the way. Go home, hide, vanish somehow! I can't be seen with a pack of dirty kids.' His brothers and sisters were indeed rather dirty, because, earlier in the day, the Lamb, in his infant state, had sprinkled a good deal of garden soil over them. The grown-up Lamb's voice was so tyrant-like, as Jane said afterwards, that they actually retreated to the back garden, and left him with his little mustache and his flannel suit to meet alone the young lady, who now came up the front garden wheeling a bicycle. The woman of the house came out, and the young lady spoke to her,, the Lamb raised his hat as she passed him,, and the children could not hear what she said, though they were craning round the corner and listening with all their ears. They felt it to be 'perfectly fair,' as Robert said, 'with that wretched Lamb in that condition.' When the Lamb spoke, in a languid voice heavy with politeness, they heard well enough. 'A puncture?' he was saying. 'Can I not be of any assistance? If you could allow me, , ?' There was a stifled explosion of laughter and the grown-up Lamb (otherwise Devereux) turned the tail of an angry eye in its direction. 'You're very kind,' said the lady, looking at the Lamb. She looked rather shy, but, as the boys put it, there didn't seem to be any nonsense about her. 'But oh,' whispered Cyril, 'I should have thought he'd had enough bicycle-mending for one day, and if she only knew that really and truly he's only a whiny-piny, silly little baby!' 'He's  not ,' Anthea murmured angrily. 'He's a dear, if people only let him alone. It's our own precious Lamb still, whatever silly idiots may turn him into, isn't he, Pussy?' Jane doubtfully supposed so. Now, the Lamb, whom I must try to remember to call St. Maur, was examining the lady's bicycle and talking to her with a very grown-up manner indeed. No one could possibly have supposed, to see and hear him, that only that very morning he had been a chubby child of two years breaking other people's Waterbury watches. Devereux (as he ought to be called for the future) took out a gold watch when he had mended the lady's bicycle, and all the hidden onlookers said 'Oh!', because it seemed so unfair that the Baby, who had only that morning destroyed two cheap but honest watches, should now, in the grown-upness to which Cyril's folly had raised him, have a real gold watch, with a chain and seals! Hilary (as I will now term him) withered his brothers and sisters with a glance, and then said to the lady, with whom he seemed to be quite friendly,  'If you will allow me, I will ride with you as far as the Cross Roads; it is getting late, and there are tramps about.' No one will ever know what answer the young lady intended to give to this gallant offer, for, directly Anthea heard it made, she rushed out, knocking against a swill pail, which overflowed in a turbid stream, and caught the Lamb (I suppose I ought to say Hilary) by the arm. The others followed, and in an instant the four dirty children were visible beyond disguise. 'Don't let him,' said Anthea to the lady, and she spoke with intense earnestness; 'he's not fit to go with anyone!' 'Go away, little girl!' said St. Maur (as we will now call him) in a terrible voice. 'Go home at once!' 'You'd much better not have anything to do with him,' the now reckless Anthea went on. 'He doesn't know who he is. He's something very different from what you think he is.' 'What do you mean?' asked the lady, not unnaturally, while Devereux (as I must term the grown-up Lamb) tried vainly to push Anthea away. The others backed her up, and she stood solid as a rock. 'You just let him go with you,' said Anthea, 'you'll soon see what I mean! How would you like to suddenly see a poor little helpless baby spinning along downhill beside you with its feet up on a bicycle it had lost control of?' The lady had turned rather pale. 'Who are these very dirty children?' she asked the grown-up Lamb (sometimes called St. Maur in these pages). 'I don't know,' he lied miserably. 'Oh, Lamb! how  can  you?' cried Jane,, 'when you know perfectly well you're our own little baby brother that we're so fond of. We're his big brothers and sisters,' she explained, turning to the lady, who with trembling hands was now turning her bicycle towards the gate, 'and we've got to take care of him. And we must get him home before sunset, or I don't know whatever will become of us. You see, he's sort of under a spell, enchanted, you know what I mean!' Again and again the Lamb (Devereux, I mean) had tried to stop Jane's eloquence, but Robert and Cyril held him, one by each leg, and no proper explanation was possible. The lady rode hastily away, and electrified her relatives at dinner by telling them of her escape from a family of dangerous lunatics. 'The little girl's eyes were simply those of a maniac. I can't think how she came to be at large,' she said. When her bicycle had whizzed away down the road, Cyril spoke gravely. 'Hilary, old chap,' he said, 'you must have had a sunstroke or something. And the things you've been saying to that lady! Why, if we were to tell you the things you've said when you are yourself again, say to-morrow morning, you wouldn't ever understand them, let alone believe them! You trust to me, old chap, and come home now, and if you're not yourself in the morning we'll ask the milkman to ask the doctor to come.' The poor grown-up Lamb (St. Maur was really one of his Christian names) seemed now too bewildered to resist. 'Since you seem all to be as mad as the whole worshipful company of hatters,' he said bitterly, 'I suppose I  had  better take you home. But you're not to suppose I shall pass this over. I shall have something to say to you all to-morrow morning.' 'Yes, you will, my Lamb,' said Anthea under her breath, 'but it won't be at all the sort of thing you think it's going to be.' In her heart she could hear the pretty, soft little loving voice of the baby Lamb, so different from the affected tones of the dreadful grown-up Lamb (one of whose names was Devereux), saying, 'Me love Panty, wants to come to own Panty.' 'Oh, let's go home, for goodness' sake,' she said. 'You shall say whatever you like in the morning, if you can,' she added in a whisper. It was a gloomy party that went home through the soft evening. During Anthea's remarks Robert had again made play with the pin and the bicycle tyre, and the Lamb (whom they had to call St. Maur or Devereux or Hilary) seemed really at last to have had his fill of bicycle-mending. So the machine was wheeled. The sun was just on the point of setting when they arrived at the White House. The four elder children would have liked to linger in the lane till the complete sunsetting turned the grown-up Lamb (whose Christian names I will not further weary you by repeating) into their own dear tiresome baby brother. But he, in his grown-upness, insisted on going on, and thus he was met in the front garden by Martha. Now you remember that, as a special favour, the Psammead had arranged that the servants in the house should never notice any change brought about by the wishes of the children. Therefore Martha merely saw the usual party, with the baby Lamb, about whom she had been desperately anxious all the afternoon, trotting beside Anthea, on fat baby legs, while the children, of course, still saw the grown-up Lamb (never mind what names he was christened by), and Martha rushed at him and caught him in her arms, exclaiming,  'Come to his own Martha, then, a precious poppet!' The grown-up Lamb (whose names shall now be buried in oblivion) struggled furiously. An expression of intense horror and annoyance was seen on his face. But Martha was stronger than he. She lifted him up and carried him into the house. None of the children will ever forget that picture. The neat grey-flannel-suited grown-up young man with the green necktie and the little black mustache, fortunately, he was slightly built, and not tall, struggling in the sturdy arms of Martha, who bore him away helpless, imploring him, as she went, to be a good boy now, and come and have his nice bremmink! Fortunately, the sun set as they reached the doorstep, the bicycle disappeared, and Martha was seen to carry into the house the real live darling sleepy two-year-old Lamb. The grown-up Lamb (nameless henceforth) was gone for ever. [Illustration: The grown-up Lamb struggled] 'For ever,' said Cyril, 'because, as soon as ever the Lamb's old enough to be bullied, we must jolly well begin to bully him, for his own sake, so that he mayn't grow up like  that .' 'You shan't bully him,' said Anthea stoutly,, 'not if I can stop it.' 'We must tame him by kindness,' said Jane. 'You see,' said Robert, 'if he grows up in the usual way, there'll be plenty of time to correct him as he goes along. The awful thing to-day was his growing up so suddenly. There was no time to improve him at all.' 'He doesn't want any improving,' said Anthea as the voice of the Lamb came cooing through the open door, just as she had heard it in her heart that afternoon,  'Me loves Panty, wants to come to own Panty!' CHAPTER X SCALPS Probably the day would have been a greater success if Cyril had not been reading  The Last of the Mohicans . The story was running in his head at breakfast, and as he took his third cup of tea he said dreamily, 'I wish there were Red Indians in England, not big ones, you know, but little ones, just about the right size for us to fight.' Everyone disagreed with him at the time and no one attached any importance to the incident. But when they went down to the sand-pit to ask for a hundred pounds in two-shilling pieces with Queen Victoria's head on, to prevent mistakes, which they had always felt to be a really reasonable wish that must turn out well, they found out that they had done it again! For the Psammead, which was very cross and sleepy, said,  'Oh, don't bother me. You've had your wish.' 'I didn't know it,' said Cyril. 'Don't you remember yesterday?' said the Sand-fairy, still more disagreeably. 'You asked me to let you have your wishes wherever you happened to be, and you wished this morning, and you've got it.' 'Oh, have we?' said Robert. 'What is it?' 'So you've forgotten?' said the Psammead, beginning to burrow. 'Never mind; you'll know soon enough. And I wish you joy of it! A nice thing you've let yourselves in for!' 'We always do somehow,' said Jane sadly. And now the odd thing was that no one could remember anyone's having wished for anything that morning. The wish about the Red Indians had not stuck in anyone's head. It was a most anxious morning. Everyone was trying to remember what had been wished for, and no one could, and everyone kept expecting something awful to happen every minute. It was most agitating; they knew from what the Psammead had said, that they must have wished for something more than usually undesirable, and they spent several hours in most agonizing uncertainty. It was not till nearly dinner-time that Jane tumbled over  The Last of the Mohicans ,, which had of course, been left face downwards on the floor,, and when Anthea had picked her and the book up she suddenly said, 'I know!' and sat down flat on the carpet. 'Oh, Pussy, how awful! It was Indians he wished for, Cyril, at breakfast, don't you remember? He said, 'I wish there were Red Indians in England,', and now there are, and they're going about scalping people all over the country, as likely as not.' 'Perhaps they're only in Northumberland and Durham,' said Jane soothingly. It was almost impossible to believe that it could really hurt people much to be scalped so far away as that. 'Don't you believe it!' said Anthea. 'The Sammyadd said we'd let ourselves in for a nice thing. That means they'll come  here . And suppose they scalped the Lamb!' 'Perhaps the scalping would come right again at sunset,' said Jane; but she did not speak so hopefully as usual. 'Not it!' said Anthea. 'The things that grow out of the wishes don't go. Look at the fifteen shillings! Pussy, I'm going to break something, and you must let me have every penny of money you've got. The Indians will come  here , don't you see? That Spiteful Psammead as good as said so. You see what my plan is? Come on!' Jane did not see at all. But she followed her sister meekly into mother's bedroom. Anthea lifted down the heavy water-jug, it had a pattern of storks and long grasses on it, which Anthea never forgot. She carried it into the dressing-room, and carefully emptied the water out of it into the bath. Then she took the jug back into the bedroom and dropped it on the floor. You know how a jug always breaks if you happen to drop it by accident. If you happen to drop it on purpose, it is quite different. Anthea dropped that jug three times, and it was as unbroken as ever. So at last she had to take her father's boot-tree and break the jug with that in cold blood. It was heartless work. Next she broke open the missionary-box with the poker. Jane told her that it was wrong, of course, but Anthea shut her lips very tight and then said,  [Illustration: She broke open the missionary-box with the poker.] 'Don't be silly, it's a matter of life and death.' There was not very much in the missionary-box,, only seven-and-fourpence,, but the girls between them had nearly four shillings. This made over eleven shillings, as you will easily see. Anthea tied up the money in a corner of her pocket-handkerchief. 'Come on, Jane!' she said, and ran down to the farm. She knew that the farmer was going into Rochester that afternoon. In fact it had been arranged that he was to take the four children with him. They had planned this in the happy hour when they believed that they we're going to get that hundred pounds, in two-shilling pieces, out of the Psammead. They had arranged to pay the farmer two shillings each for the ride. Now Anthea hastily explained to him that they could not go, but would he take Martha and the Baby instead? He agreed, but he was not pleased to get only half-a-crown instead of eight shillings. Then the girls ran home again. Anthea was agitated, but not flurried. When she came to think it over afterwards, she could not help seeing that she had acted with the most far-seeing promptitude, just like a born general. She fetched a little box from her corner drawer, and went to find Martha, who was laying the cloth and not in the best of tempers. 'Look here,' said Anthea. 'I've broken the water jug in mother's room.' 'Just like you, always up to some mischief,' said Martha, dumping down a salt-cellar with a bang. 'Don't be cross, Martha dear,' said Anthea. 'I've got enough money to pay for a new one, if only you'll be a dear and go and buy it for us. Your cousins keep a china-shop, don't they? And I would like you to get it to-day, in case mother comes home to-morrow. You know she said she might perhaps.' 'But you're all going into town yourselves,' said Martha. 'We can't afford to, if we get the new jug,' said Anthea; 'but we'll pay for you to go, if you'll take the Lamb. And I say, Martha, look here, I'll give you my Liberty box, if you'll go. Look, it's most awfully pretty, all inlaid with real silver and ivory and ebony, like King Solomon's temple.' 'I see,' said Martha,, 'no, I don't want your box, miss. What you want is to get the precious Lamb off your hands for the afternoon. Don't you go for to think I don't see through you!' This was so true that Anthea longed to deny it at once. Martha had no business to know so much. But she held her tongue. Martha set down the bread with a bang that made it jump off its trencher. 'I  do  want the jug got,' said Anthea softly. 'You  will  go, won't you?' 'Well, just for this once, I don't mind; but mind you don't get into none of your outrageous mischief while I'm gone, that's all!' 'He's going earlier than he thought,' said Anthea eagerly. 'You'd better hurry and get dressed. Do put on that lovely purple frock, Martha, and the hat with the pink cornflowers, and the yellow-lace collar. Jane'll finish laying the cloth, and I'll wash the Lamb and get him ready.' As she washed the unwilling Lamb and hurried him into his best clothes, Anthea peeped out of the window from time to time; so far all was well, she could see no Red Indians. When with a rush and a scurry and some deepening of the damask of Martha's complexion she and the Lamb had been got off, Anthea drew a deep breath. ' He's  safe!' she said, and, to Jane's horror, flung herself down on the floor and burst into floods of tears. Jane did not understand at all how a person could be so brave and like a general, and then suddenly give way and go flat like an air-balloon when you prick it. It is better not to go flat, of course, but you will observe that Anthea did not give way till her aim was accomplished. She had got the dear Lamb out of danger, she felt certain that the Red Indians would be round the White House or nowhere, the farmer's cart would not come back till after sunset, so she could afford to cry a little. It was partly with joy that she cried, because she had done what she meant to do. She cried for about three minutes, while Jane hugged her miserably and said at five-second intervals, 'Don't cry, Panther dear!' Then she jumped up, rubbed her eyes hard with the corner of her pinafore, so that they kept red for the rest of the day, and started to tell the boys. But just at that moment cook rang the dinner-bell, and nothing could be said till they had been helped to minced beef. Then cook left the room, and Anthea told her tale. But it is a mistake to tell a thrilling tale when people are eating minced beef and boiled potatoes. There seemed somehow to be something about the food that made the idea of Red Indians seem flat and unbelievable. The boys actually laughed, and called Anthea a little silly. 'Why,' said Cyril, 'I'm almost sure it was before I said that, that Jane said she wished it would be a fine day.' 'It wasn't,' said Jane briefly. 'Why, if it was Indians,' Cyril went on,, 'salt, please, and mustard, I must have something to make this mush go down,, if it was Indians, they'd have been infesting the place long before this, you know they would. I believe it's the fine day.' 'Then why did the Sammyadd say we'd let ourselves in for a nice thing?' asked Anthea. She was feeling very cross. She knew she had acted with nobility and discretion, and after that it was very hard to be called a little silly, especially when she had the weight of a burglared missionary-box and about seven-and-fourpence, mostly in coppers, lying like lead upon her conscience. There was a silence, during which cook took away the mincy plates and brought in the pudding. As soon as she had retired, Cyril began again. 'Of course I don't mean to say,' he admitted, 'that it wasn't a good thing to get Martha and the Lamb out of the way for the afternoon; but as for Red Indians, why, you know jolly well the wishes always come that very minute. If there was going to be Red Indians, they'd be here now.' 'I expect they are,' said Anthea; 'they're lurking amid the undergrowth, for anything you know. I do think you're most unkind.' 'Indians almost always  do  lurk, really, though, don't they?' put in Jane, anxious for peace. 'No, they don't,' said Cyril tartly. 'And I'm not unkind, I'm only truthful. And I say it was utter rot breaking the water-jug; and as for the missionary-box, I believe it's a treason-crime, and I shouldn't wonder if you could be hanged for it, if any of us was to split',  'Shut up, can't you?' said Robert; but Cyril couldn't. You see, he felt in his heart that if there  should  be Indians they would be entirely his own fault, so he did not wish to believe in them. And trying not to believe things when in your heart you are almost sure they are true, is as bad for the temper as anything I know. 'It's simply idiotic,' he said, 'talking about Indians, when you can see for yourself that it's Jane who's got her wish. Look what a fine day it is, ,  OH! , ' He had turned towards the window to point out the fineness of the day, the others turned too, and a frozen silence caught at Cyril, and none of the others felt at all like breaking it. For there, peering round the corner of the window, among the red leaves of the Virginia creeper, was a face, a brown face, with a long nose and a tight mouth and very bright eyes. And the face was painted in coloured patches. It had long black hair, and in the hair were feathers! Every child's mouth in the room opened, and stayed open. The pudding was growing white and cold on their plates. No one could move. Suddenly the feathered head was cautiously withdrawn, and the spell was broken. I am sorry to say that Anthea's first words were very like a girl. 'There, now!' she said. 'I told you so!' The pudding had now definitely ceased to charm. Hastily wrapping their portions in a  Spectator  of the week before the week before last, they hid them behind the crinkled paper stove-ornament, and fled upstairs to reconnoitre and to hold a hurried council. 'Pax,' said Cyril handsomely when they reached their mother's bedroom. 'Panther, I'm sorry if I was a brute.' 'All right,' said Anthea; 'but you see now!' No further trace of Indians, however, could be discerned from the windows. 'Well,' said Robert, 'what are we to do?' 'The only thing I can think of,' said Anthea, who was now generally admitted to be the heroine of the day, 'is, if we dressed up as like Indians as we can, and looked out of the windows, or even went out. They might think we were the powerful leaders of a large neighbouring tribe, and, and not do anything to us, you know, for fear of awful vengeance.' 'But Eliza, and the cook?' said Jane. 'You forget, they can't notice anything,' said Robert. 'They wouldn't notice anything out of the way, even if they were scalped or roasted at a slow fire.' 'But would they come right at sunset?' 'Of course. You can't be really scalped or burned to death without noticing it, and you'd be sure to notice it next day, even if it escaped your attention at the time,' said Cyril. 'I think Anthea's right, but we shall want a most awful lot of feathers.' 'I'll go down to the hen-house,' said Robert. 'There's one of the turkeys in there, it's not very well. I could cut its feathers without it minding much. It's very bad, doesn't seem to care what happens to it. Get me the cutting-out scissors.' Earnest reconnoitring convinced them all that no Indians were in the poultry-yard. Robert went. In five minutes he came back, pale, but with many feathers. 'Look here,' he said, 'this is jolly serious. I cut off the feathers, and when I turned to come out there was an Indian squinting at me from under the old hen-coop. I just brandished the feathers and yelled, and got away before he could get the coop off top of himself. Panther, get the coloured blankets off our beds, and look slippy, can't you?' It is wonderful how like an Indian you can make yourself with blankets and feathers and coloured scarves. Of course none of the children happened to have long black hair, but there was a lot of black calico that had been bought to cover school-books with. They cut strips of this into a sort of fine fringe, and fastened it round their heads with the amber-coloured ribbons off the girls' Sunday dresses. Then they stuck turkeys' feathers in the ribbons. The calico looked very like long black hair, especially when the strips began to curl up a bit. 'But our faces,' said Anthea, 'they're not at all the right colour. We're all rather pale, and I'm sure I don't know why, but Cyril is the colour of putty.' 'I'm not,' said Cyril. 'The real Indians outside seem to be brownish,' said Robert hastily. 'I think we ought to be really  red , it's sort of superior to have a red skin, if you are one.' The red ochre cook uses for the kitchen bricks seemed to be about the reddest thing in the house. The children mixed some in a saucer with milk, as they had seen cook do for the kitchen floor. Then they carefully painted each other's faces and hands with it, till they were quite as red as any Red Indian need be, if not redder. They knew at once that they must look very terrible when they met Eliza in the passage, and she screamed aloud. This unsolicited testimonial pleased them very much. Hastily telling her not to be a goose, and that it was only a game, the four blanketed, feathered, really and truly Redskins went boldly out to meet the foe. I say boldly. That is because I wish to be polite. At any rate, they went. Along the hedge dividing the wilderness from the garden was a row of dark heads, all highly feathered. 'It's our only chance,' whispered Anthea. 'Much better than to wait for their blood-freezing attack. We must pretend like mad. Like that game of cards where you pretend you've got aces when you haven't. Fluffing they call it, I think. Now then. Whoop!' With four wild war-whoops, or as near them as white children could be expected to go without any previous practice, they rushed through the gate and struck four war-like attitudes in face of the line of Red Indians. These were all about the same height, and that height was Cyril's. 'I hope to goodness they can talk English,' said Cyril through his attitude. Anthea knew they could, though she never knew how she came to know it. She had a white towel tied to a walking-stick. This was a flag of truce, and she waved it, in the hope that the Indians would know what it was. Apparently they did, for one who was browner than the others stepped forward. 'Ye seek a pow-wow?' he said in excellent English. 'I am Golden Eagle, of the mighty tribe of Rock-dwellers.' [Illustration: 'Ye seek a pow-wow?' he said] 'And I,' said Anthea, with a sudden inspiration, 'am the Black Panther, chief of the, the, the, Mazawattee tribe. My brothers, I don't mean, yes, I do, the tribe, I mean the Mazawattees, are in ambush below the brow of yonder hill.' 'And what mighty warriors be these?' asked Golden Eagle, turning to the others. Cyril said he was the great chief Squirrel, of the Moning Congo tribe, and, seeing that Jane was sucking her thumb and could evidently think of no name for herself, he added, 'This great warrior is Wild Cat, Pussy Ferox we call it in this land, leader of the vast Phiteezi tribe.' 'And thou, valorous Redskin?' Golden Eagle inquired suddenly of Robert, who, taken unawares, could only reply that he was Bobs, leader of the Cape Mounted Police. 'And now,' said Black Panther, 'our tribes, if we just whistle them up, will far outnumber your puny forces; so resistance is useless. Return, therefore, to your land, O brother, and smoke pipes of peace in your wampums with your squaws and your medicine-men, and dress yourselves in the gayest wigwams, and eat happily of the juicy fresh-caught moccasins.' 'You've got it all wrong,' murmured Cyril angrily. But Golden Eagle only looked inquiringly at her. 'Thy customs are other than ours, O Black Panther,' he said. 'Bring up thy tribe, that we may hold pow-wow in state before them, as becomes great chiefs.' 'We'll bring them up right enough,' said Anthea, 'with their bows and arrows, and tomahawks and scalping-knives, and everything you can think of, if you don't look sharp and go.' She spoke bravely enough, but the hearts of all the children were beating furiously, and their breath came in shorter and shorter gasps. For the little real Red Indians were closing up round them, coming nearer and nearer with angry murmurs, so that they were the centre of a crowd of dark cruel faces. 'It's no go,' whispered Robert. 'I knew it wouldn't be. We must make a bolt for the Psammead. It might help us. If it doesn't, well, I suppose we shall come alive again at sunset. I wonder if scalping hurts as much as they say.' 'I'll wave the flag again,' said Anthea. 'If they stand back, we'll run for it.' She waved the towel, and the chief commanded his followers to stand back. Then, charging wildly at the place where the line of Indians was thinnest, the four children started to run. Their first rush knocked down some half-dozen Indians, over whose blanketed bodies the children leaped, and made straight for the sand-pit. This was no time for the safe easy way by which carts go down, right over the edge of the sand-pit they went, among the yellow and pale purple flowers and dried grasses, past the little bank martins' little front doors, skipping, clinging, bounding, stumbling, sprawling, and finally rolling. Yellow Eagle and his followers came up with them just at the very spot where they had seen the Psammead that morning. Breathless and beaten, the wretched children now awaited their fate. Sharp knives and axes gleamed round them, but worse than these was the cruel light in the eyes of Golden Eagle and his followers. 'Ye have lied to us, O Black Panther of the Mazawattees, and thou, too, Squirrel of the Moning Congos. These also, Pussy Ferox of the Phiteezi, and Bobs of the Cape Mounted Police,, these also have lied to us, if not with their tongues, yet by their silence. Ye have lied under the cover of the Truce-flag of the Pale-face. Ye have no followers. Your tribes are far away, following the hunting trail. What shall be their doom?' he concluded, turning with a bitter smile to the other Red Indians. 'Build we the fire!' shouted his followers; and at once a dozen ready volunteers started to look for fuel. The four children, each held between two strong little Indians, cast despairing glances round them. Oh, if they could only see the Psammead! 'Do you mean to scalp us first and then roast us?' asked Anthea desperately. 'Of course!' Redskin opened his eyes at her. 'It's always done.' The Indians had formed a ring round the children, and now sat on the ground gazing at their captives. There was a threatening silence. Then slowly, by twos and threes, the Indians who had gone to look for firewood came back, and they came back empty-handed. They had not been able to find a single stick of wood for a fire! No one ever can, as a matter of fact, in that part of Kent. The children drew a deep breath of relief, but it ended in a moan of terror. For bright knives were being brandished all about them. Next moment each child was seized by an Indian; each closed its eyes and tried not to scream. They waited for the sharp agony of the knife. It did not come. Next moment they were released, and fell in a trembling heap. Their heads did not hurt at all. They only felt strangely cool! Wild war-whoops rang in their ears. When they ventured to open their eyes they saw four of their foes dancing round them with wild leaps and screams, and each of the four brandished in his hand a scalp of long flowing black hair. They put their hands to their heads, their own scalps were safe! The poor untutored savages had indeed scalped the children. But they had only, so to speak, scalped them of the black calico ringlets! [Illustration: Bright knives were being brandished all about them] The children fell into each other's arms, sobbing and laughing. 'Their scalps are ours,' chanted the chief; 'ill-rooted were their ill-fated hairs! They came off in the hands of the victors, without struggle, without resistance, they yielded their scalps to the conquering Rock-dwellers! Oh, how little a thing is a scalp so lightly won!' 'They'll take our real ones in a minute; you see if they don't,' said Robert, trying to rub some of the red ochre off his face and hands on to his hair. 'Cheated of our just and fiery revenge are we,' the chant went on,, 'but there are other torments than the scalping-knife and the flames. Yet is the slow fire the correct thing. O strange unnatural country, wherein a man may find no wood to burn his enemy!, Ah for the boundless forests of my native land, where the great trees for thousands of miles grow but to furnish firewood wherewithal to burn our foes. Ah, would we were but in our native forest once more!' Suddenly like a flash of lightning, the golden gravel shone all round the four children instead of the dusky figures. For every single Indian had vanished on the instant at their leader's word. The Psammead must have been there all the time. And it had given the Indian chief his wish.                                          Martha brought home a jug with a pattern of storks and long grasses on it. Also she brought back all Anthea's money. 'My cousin, she gave me the jug for luck; she said it was an odd one what the basin of had got smashed.' 'Oh, Martha, you are a dear!' sighed Anthea, throwing her arms round her. 'Yes,' giggled Martha, 'you'd better make the most of me while you've got me. I shall give your ma notice directly minute she comes back.' 'Oh, Martha, we haven't been so  very  horrid to you, have we?' asked Anthea, aghast. 'Oh, it isn't that, miss.' Martha giggled more than ever. 'I'm a-goin' to be married. It's Beale the gamekeeper. He's been a-proposin' to me off and on ever since you come home from the clergyman's where you got locked up on the church-tower. And to-day I said the word an' made him a happy man.'                                          Anthea put the seven-and-fourpence back in the missionary-box, and pasted paper over the place where the poker had broken it. She was very glad to be able to do this, and she does not know to this day whether breaking open a missionary-box is or is not a hanging matter! CHAPTER XI (AND LAST) THE LAST WISH Of course you, who see above that this is the eleventh (and last) chapter, know very well that the day of which this chapter tells must be the last on which Cyril, Anthea, Robert, and Jane will have a chance of getting anything out of the Psammead, or Sand-fairy. But the children themselves did not know this. They were full of rosy visions, and, whereas on the other days they had often found it extremely difficult to think of anything really nice to wish for, their brains were now full of the most beautiful and sensible ideas. 'This,' as Jane remarked afterwards, 'is always the way.' Everyone was up extra early that morning, and these plans were hopefully discussed in the garden before breakfast. The old idea of one hundred pounds in modern florins was still first favourite, but there were others that ran it close, the chief of these being the 'pony-each' idea. This had a great advantage. You could wish for a pony each during the morning, ride it all day, have it vanish at sunset, and wish it back again next day. Which would be an economy of litter and stabling. But at breakfast two things happened. First, there was a letter from mother. Granny was better, and mother and father hoped to be home that very afternoon. A cheer arose. And of course this news at once scattered all the before-breakfast wish-ideas. For everyone saw quite plainly that the wish of the day must be something to please mother and not to please themselves. 'I wonder what she  would  like,' pondered Cyril. 'She'd like us all to be good,' said Jane primly. 'Yes, but that's so dull for us,' Cyril rejoined; 'and besides, I should hope we could be that without sand-fairies to help us. No; it must be something splendid, that we couldn't possibly get without wishing for.' 'Look out,' said Anthea in a warning voice; 'don't forget yesterday. Remember, we get our wishes now just wherever we happen to be when we say 'I wish.' Don't let's let ourselves in for anything silly, to-day of all days.' 'All right,' said Cyril. 'You needn't talk so much.' Just then Martha came in with a jug full of hot water for the tea-pot, and a face full of importance for the children. 'A blessing we're all alive to eat our breakfast!' she said darkly. 'Why, whatever's happened?' everybody asked. 'Oh, nothing,' said Martha, 'only it seems nobody's safe from being murdered in their beds nowadays.' 'Why,' said Jane as an agreeable thrill of horror ran down her back and legs and out at her toes, ' has  anyone been murdered in their beds?' 'Well, not exactly,' said Martha; 'but they might just as well. There's been burglars over at Peasemarsh Place, Beale's just told me, and they've took every single one of Lady Chittenden's diamonds and jewels and things, and she's a-goin out of one fainting fit into another, with hardly time to say 'Oh, my diamonds!' in between. And Lord Chittenden's away in London.' 'Lady Chittenden,' said Anthea; 'we've seen her. She wears a red-and-white dress, and she has no children of her own and can't abide other folkses'.' 'That's her,' said Martha. 'Well, she's put all her trust in riches, and you see how she's served. They say the diamonds and things was worth thousands of pounds. There was a necklace and a river, whatever that is, and no end of bracelets; and a tarrer and ever so many rings. But there, I mustn't stand talking and all the place to clean down afore your ma comes home.' 'I don't see why she should ever have had such lots of diamonds,' said Anthea when Martha had flounced off. 'She was not at all a nice lady, I thought. And mother hasn't any diamonds, and hardly any jewels, the topaz necklace, and the sapphire ring daddy gave her when they were engaged, and the garnet star, and the little pearl brooch with great-grandpapa's hair in it,, that's about all.' 'When I'm grown up I'll buy mother no end of diamonds,' said Robert, 'if she wants them. I shall make so much money exploring in Africa I shan't know what to do with it.' 'Wouldn't it be jolly,' said Jane dreamily, 'if mother could find all these lovely things, necklaces and rivers of diamonds and tarrers?' ' Ti, aras ,' said Cyril. 'Ti, aras, then,, and rings and everything in her room when she came home. I wish she would',  The others gazed at her in horror. 'Well, she  will ,' said Robert; 'you've wished, my good Jane, and our only chance now is to find the Psammead, and if it's in a good temper it  may  take back the wish and give us another. If not, well, goodness knows what we're in for!, the police of course, and, ,  Don't cry, silly! We'll stand by you. Father says we need never to be afraid if we don't do anything wrong and always speak the truth.' But Cyril and Anthea exchanged gloomy glances. They remembered how convincing the truth about the Psammead had been once before when told to the police. It was a day of misfortunes. Of course the Psammead could not be found. Nor the jewels, though every one of the children searched the mother's room again and again. 'Of course,' Robert said, ' we  couldn't find them. It'll be mother who'll do that. Perhaps she'll think they've been in the house for years and years, and never know they are the stolen ones at all.' 'Oh yes!' Cyril was very scornful; 'then mother will be a receiver of stolen goods, and you know jolly well what  that's  worse than.' Another and exhaustive search of the sand-pit failed to reveal the Psammead, so the children went back to the house slowly and sadly. 'I don't care,' said Anthea stoutly, 'we'll tell mother the truth, and she'll give back the jewels, and make everything all right.' 'Do you think so?' said Cyril slowly. 'Do you think she'll believe us? Could anyone believe about a Sammyadd unless they'd seen it? She'll think we're pretending. Or else she'll think we're raving mad, and then we shall be sent to the mad-house. How would you like it?', he turned suddenly on the miserable Jane,, 'how would you like it, to be shut up in an iron cage with bars and padded walls, and nothing to do but stick straws in your hair all day, and listen to the howlings and ravings of the other maniacs? Make up your minds to it, all of you. It's no use telling mother.' 'But it's true,' said Jane. 'Of course it is, but it's not true enough for grown-up people to believe it,' said Anthea. 'Cyril's right. Let's put flowers in all the vases, and try not to think about the diamonds. After all, everything has come right in the end all the other times.' So they filled all the pots they could find with flowers, asters and zinnias, and loose-leaved late red roses from the wall of the stableyard, till the house was a perfect bower. And almost as soon as dinner was cleared away mother arrived, and was clasped in eight loving arms. It was very difficult indeed not to tell her all about the Psammead at once, because they had got into the habit of telling her everything. But they did succeed in not telling her. [Illustration: She was clasped in eight loving arms] Mother, on her side, had plenty to tell them, about Granny, and Granny's pigeons, and Auntie Emma's lame tame donkey. She was very delighted with the flowery-boweryness of the house; and everything seemed so natural and pleasant, now that she was home again, that the children almost thought they must have dreamed the Psammead. But, when mother moved towards the stairs to go up to her bedroom and take off her bonnet, the eight arms clung round her just as if she only had two children, one the Lamb and the other an octopus. 'Don't go up, mummy darling,' said Anthea; 'let me take your things up for you.' 'Or I will,' said Cyril. 'We want you to come and look at the rose-tree,' said Robert. 'Oh, don't go up!' said Jane helplessly. 'Nonsense, dears,' said mother briskly, 'I'm not such an old woman yet that I can't take my bonnet off in the proper place. Besides I must wash these black hands of mine.' So up she went, and the children, following her, exchanged glances of gloomy foreboding. Mother took off her bonnet,, it was a very pretty hat, really, with white roses in it,, and when she had taken it off she went to the dressing-table to do her pretty hair. On the table between the ring-stand and the pin-cushion lay a green leather case. Mother opened it. 'Oh, how lovely!' she cried. It was a ring, a large pearl with shining many-lighted diamonds set round it. 'Wherever did this come from?' mother asked, trying it on her wedding finger, which it fitted beautifully. 'However did it come here?' 'I don't know,' said each of the children truthfully. 'Father must have told Martha to put it here,' mother said. 'I'll run down and ask her.' 'Let me look at it,' said Anthea, who knew Martha would not be able to see the ring. But when Martha was asked, of course she denied putting the ring there, and so did Eliza and cook. Mother came back to her bedroom, very much interested and pleased about the ring. But, when she opened the dressing-table drawer and found a long case containing an almost priceless diamond necklace, she was more interested still, though not so pleased. In the wardrobe, when she went to put away her 'bonnet,' she found a tiara and several brooches, and the rest of the jewellery turned up in various parts of the room during the next half-hour. The children looked more and more uncomfortable, and now Jane began to sniff. Mother looked at her gravely. 'Jane,' she said, 'I am sure you know something about this. Now think before you speak, and tell me the truth.' 'We found a Fairy,' said Jane obediently. [Illustration: 'We found a Fairy,' said Jane obediently] 'No nonsense, please,' said her mother sharply. 'Don't be silly, Jane,' Cyril interrupted. Then he went on desperately. 'Look here, mother, we've never seen the things before, but Lady Chittenden at Peasmarsh Place lost all her jewellery by wicked burglars last night. Could this possibly be it?' All drew a deep breath. They were saved. 'But how could they have put it here? And why should they?' asked mother, not unreasonably. 'Surely it would have been easier and safer to make off with it?' 'Suppose,' said Cyril, 'they thought it better to wait for, for sunset, nightfall, I mean, before they went off with it. No one but us knew that you were coming back to-day.' 'I must send for the police at once,' said mother distractedly. 'Oh, how I wish daddy were here!' 'Wouldn't it be better to wait till he  does  come?' asked Robert, knowing that his father would not be home before sunset. 'No, no; I can't wait a minute with all this on my mind,' cried mother. 'All this' was the heap of jewel-cases on the bed. They put them all in the wardrobe, and mother locked it. Then mother called Martha. 'Martha,' she said, 'has any stranger been into my room since I've been away? Now, answer me truthfully.' 'No, mum,' answered Martha; 'leastways, what I mean to say',  She stopped. 'Come,' said her mistress kindly, 'I see someone has. You must tell me at once. Don't be frightened. I'm sure  you  haven't done anything wrong.' Martha burst into heavy sobs. 'I was a-goin' to give you warning this very day, mum, to leave at the end of my month, so I was,, on account of me being going to make a respectable young man happy. A gamekeeper he is by trade, mum, and I wouldn't deceive you, of the name of Beale. And it's as true as I stand here, it was your coming home in such a hurry, and no warning given, out of the kindness of his heart it was, as he says, 'Martha, my beauty,' he says,, which I ain't, and never was, but you know how them men will go on,, 'I can't see you a-toiling and a-moiling and not lend a 'elping 'and; which mine is a strong arm, and it's yours Martha, my dear,' says he. And so he helped me a-cleanin' of the windows, but outside, mum, the whole time, and me in; if I never say another breathing word it's gospel truth.' 'Were you with him the whole time?' asked her mistress. 'Him outside and me in, I was,' said Martha; 'except for fetching up a fresh pail and the leather that that slut of a Eliza'd hidden away behind the mangle.' 'That will do,' said the children's mother. 'I am not pleased with you, Martha, but you have spoken the truth, and that counts for something.' When Martha had gone, the children clung round their mother. 'Oh, mummy darling,' cried Anthea, 'it isn't Beale's fault, it isn't really! He's a great dear; he is, truly and honourably, and as honest as the day. Don't let the police take him, mummy! Oh, don't, don't, don't!' It was truly awful. Here was an innocent man accused of robbery through that silly wish of Jane's, and it was absolutely useless to tell the truth. All longed to, but they thought of the straws in the hair and the shrieks of the other frantic maniacs, and they could not do it. 'Is there a cart hereabouts?' asked the mother feverishly. 'A trap of any sort? I must drive in to Rochester and tell the police at once.' All the children sobbed, 'There's a cart at the farm, but, oh, don't go!, don't go!, oh, don't go!, wait till daddy comes home!' Mother took not the faintest notice. When she had set her mind on a thing she always went straight through with it; she was rather like Anthea in this respect. 'Look here, Cyril,' she said, sticking on her hat with long sharp violet-headed pins, 'I leave you in charge. Stay in the dressing-room. You can pretend to be swimming boats in the bath, or something. Say I gave you leave. But stay there, with the door on the landing open; I've locked the other. And don't let anyone go into my room. Remember, no one knows the jewels are there except me, and all of you, and the wicked thieves who put them there. Robert, you stay in the garden and watch the windows. If anyone tries to get in you must run and tell the two farm men that I'll send up to wait in the kitchen. I'll tell them there are dangerous characters about, that's true enough. Now remember, I trust you both. But I don't think they'll try it till after dark, so you're quite safe. Good-bye, darlings.' And she locked her bedroom door and went off with the key in her pocket. The children could not help admiring the dashing and decided way in which she had acted. They thought how useful she would have been in organising escape from some of the tight places in which they had found themselves of late in consequence of their ill-timed wishes. 'She's a born general,' said Cyril,, 'but  I  don't know what's going to happen to us. Even if the girls were to hunt for that old Sammyadd and find it, and get it to take the jewels away again, mother would only think we hadn't looked out properly and let the burglars sneak in and get them, or else the police will think  we've  got them, or else that she's been fooling them. Oh, it's a pretty decent average ghastly mess this time, and no mistake!' He savagely made a paper boat and began to float it in the bath, as he had been told to do. Robert went into the garden and sat down on the worn yellow grass, with his miserable head between his helpless hands. Anthea and Jane whispered together in the passage downstairs, where the cocoanut matting was, with the hole in it that you always caught your foot in if you were not careful. Martha's voice could be heard in the kitchen,, grumbling loud and long. 'It's simply quite too dreadfully awful,' said Anthea. 'How do you know all the diamonds are there, too? If they aren't, the police will think mother and father have got them, and that they've only given up some of them for a kind of desperate blind. And they'll be put in prison, and we shall be branded outcasts, the children of felons. And it won't be at all nice for father and mother either,' she added, by a candid after-thought. 'But what can we  do ?' asked Jane. 'Nothing, at least we might look for the Psammead again. It's a very,  very  hot day. He may have come out to warm that whisker of his.' 'He won't give us any more beastly wishes to-day,' said Jane flatly. 'He gets crosser and crosser every time we see him. I believe he hates having to give wishes.' Anthea had been shaking her head gloomily, now she stopped shaking it so suddenly that it really looked as though she were pricking up her ears. 'What is it?' asked Jane. 'Oh, have you thought of something?' 'Our one chance,' cried Anthea dramatically; 'the last lone-lorn forlorn hope. Come on.' At a brisk trot she led the way to the sand-pit. Oh, joy!, there was the Psammead, basking in a golden sandy hollow and preening its whiskers happily in the glowing afternoon sun. The moment it saw them it whisked round and began to burrow, it evidently preferred its own company to theirs. But Anthea was too quick for it. She caught it by its furry shoulders gently but firmly, and held it. 'Here, none of that!' said the Psammead. 'Leave go of me, will you?' But Anthea held him fast. 'Dear kind darling Sammyadd,' she said breathlessly. 'Oh yes, it's all very well,' it said; 'you want another wish, I expect. But I can't keep on slaving from morning till night giving people their wishes. I must have  some  time to myself.' 'Do you hate giving wishes?' asked Anthea gently, and her voice trembled with excitement. 'Of course I do,' it said. 'Leave go of me or I'll bite!, I really will, I mean it. Oh, well, if you choose to risk it.' Anthea risked it and held on. 'Look here,' she said, 'don't bite me, listen to reason. If you'll only do what we want to-day, we'll never ask you for another wish as long as we live.' The Psammead was much moved. 'I'd do anything,' it said in a tearful voice. 'I'd almost burst myself to give you one wish after another, as long as I held out, if you'd only never, never ask me to do it after to-day. If you knew how I hate to blow myself out with other people's wishes, and how frightened I am always that I shall strain a muscle or something. And then to wake up every morning and know you've  got  to do it. You don't know what it is, you don't know what it is, you don't!' Its voice cracked with emotion, and the last 'don't' was a squeak. Anthea set it down gently on the sand. 'It's all over now,' she said soothingly. 'We promise faithfully never to ask for another wish after to-day.' 'Well, go ahead,' said the Psammead; 'let's get it over.' 'How many can you do?' 'I don't know, as long as I can hold out.' 'Well, first, I wish Lady Chittenden may find she's never lost her jewels.' The Psammead blew itself out, collapsed, and said, 'Done.' 'I wish,' said Anthea more slowly, 'mother mayn't get to the police.' 'Done,' said the creature after the proper interval. 'I wish,' said Jane suddenly, 'mother could forget all about the diamonds.' 'Done,' said the Psammead; but its voice was weaker. 'Would you like to rest a little?' asked Anthea considerately. 'Yes, please,' said the Psammead; 'and, before we go any further, will you wish something for me?' 'Can't you do wishes for yourself?' 'Of course not,' it said; 'we were always expected to give each other our wishes, not that we had any to speak of in the good old Megatherium days. Just wish, will you, that you may never be able, any of you, to tell anyone a word about  Me .' 'Why?' asked Jane. 'Why, don't you see, if you told grown-ups I should have no peace of my life. They'd get hold of me, and they wouldn't wish silly things like you do, but real earnest things; and the scientific people would hit on some way of making things last after sunset, as likely as not; and they'd ask for a graduated income-tax, and old-age pensions, and manhood suffrage, and free secondary education, and dull things like that; and get them, and keep them, and the whole world would be turned topsy-turvy. Do wish it! Quick!' Anthea repeated the Psammead's wish, and it blew itself out to a larger size than they had yet seen it attain. 'And now,' it said as it collapsed, 'can I do anything more for you?' 'Just one thing; and I think that clears everything up, doesn't it, Jane? I wish Martha to forget about the diamond ring, and mother to forget about the keeper cleaning the windows.' 'It's like the 'Brass Bottle,'' said Jane. 'Yes, I'm glad we read that or I should never have thought of it.' 'Now,' said the Psammead faintly, 'I'm almost worn out. Is there anything else?' 'No; only thank you kindly for all you've done for us, and I hope you'll have a good long sleep, and I hope we shall see you again some day.' 'Is that a wish?' it said in a weak voice. 'Yes, please,' said the two girls together. [Illustration: It burrowed, and disappeared, scratching fiercely to the last] Then for the last time in this story they saw the Psammead blow itself out and collapse suddenly. It nodded to them, blinked its long snail's eyes, burrowed, and disappeared, scratching fiercely to the last, and the sand closed over it.                                          'I hope we've done right?' said Jane. 'I'm sure we have,' said Anthea. 'Come on home and tell the boys.' Anthea found Cyril glooming over his paper boats, and told him. Jane told Robert. The two tales were only just ended when mother walked in, hot and dusty. She explained that as she was being driven into Rochester to buy the girls' autumn school-dresses the axle had broken, and but for the narrowness of the lane and the high soft hedges she would have been thrown out. As it was, she was not hurt, but she had had to walk home. 'And oh, my dearest dear chicks,' she said, 'I am simply dying for a cup of tea! Do run and see if the water boils!' 'So you see it's all right,' Jane whispered. 'She doesn't remember.' 'No more does Martha,' said Anthea, who had been to ask after the state of the kettle. As the servants sat at their tea, Beale the gamekeeper dropped in. He brought the welcome news that Lady Chittenden's diamonds had not been lost at all. Lord Chittenden had taken them to be re-set and cleaned, and the maid who knew about it had gone for a holiday. So that was all right. 'I wonder if we ever shall see the Psammead again,' said Jane wistfully as they walked in the garden, while mother was putting the Lamb to bed. 'I'm sure we shall,' said Cyril, 'if you really wished it.' 'We've promised never to ask it for another wish,' said Anthea. 'I never want to,' said Robert earnestly. They did see it again, of course, but not in this story. And it was not in a sand-pit either, but in a very, very, very different place. It was in a, ,  But I must say no more. CHAPTER 1. THE COUNCIL OF WAYS AND MEANS This is the story of the different ways we looked for treasure, and I think when you have read it you will see that we were not lazy about the looking. There are some things I must tell before I begin to tell about the treasure-seeking, because I have read books myself, and I know how beastly it is when a story begins, “‘Alas!” said Hildegarde with a deep sigh, “we must look our last on this ancestral home”’, and then some one else says something, and you don’t know for pages and pages where the home is, or who Hildegarde is, or anything about it. Our ancestral home is in the Lewisham Road. It is semi-detached and has a garden, not a large one. We are the Bastables. There are six of us besides Father. Our Mother is dead, and if you think we don’t care because I don’t tell you much about her you only show that you do not understand people at all. Dora is the eldest. Then Oswald, and then Dicky. Oswald won the Latin prize at his preparatory school, and Dicky is good at sums. Alice and Noel are twins: they are ten, and Horace Octavius is my youngest brother. It is one of us that tells this story, but I shall not tell you which: only at the very end perhaps I will. While the story is going on you may be trying to guess, only I bet you don’t. It was Oswald who first thought of looking for treasure. Oswald often thinks of very interesting things. And directly he thought of it he did not keep it to himself, as some boys would have done, but he told the others, and said,  ‘I’ll tell you what, we must go and seek for treasure: it is always what you do to restore the fallen fortunes of your House.’ Dora said it was all very well. She often says that. She was trying to mend a large hole in one of Noel’s stockings. He tore it on a nail when we were playing shipwrecked mariners on top of the chicken-house the day H. O. fell off and cut his chin: he has the scar still. Dora is the only one of us who ever tries to mend anything. Alice tries to make things sometimes. Once she knitted a red scarf for Noel because his chest is delicate, but it was much wider at one end than the other, and he wouldn’t wear it. So we used it as a pennon, and it did very well, because most of our things are black or grey since Mother died; and scarlet was a nice change. Father does not like you to ask for new things. That was one way we had of knowing that the fortunes of the ancient House of Bastable were really fallen. Another way was that there was no more pocket-money, except a penny now and then to the little ones, and people did not come to dinner any more, like they used to, with pretty dresses, driving up in cabs, and the carpets got holes in them, and when the legs came off things they were not sent to be mended, and we gave  up  having the gardener except for the front garden, and not that very often. And the silver in the big oak plate-chest that is lined with green baize all went away to the shop to have the dents and scratches taken out of it, and it never came back. We think Father hadn’t enough money to pay the silver man for taking out the dents and scratches. The new spoons and forks were yellowy-white, and not so heavy as the old ones, and they never shone after the first day or two. Father was very ill after Mother died; and while he was ill his business-partner went to Spain, and there was never much money afterwards. I don’t know why. Then the servants left and there was only one, a General. A great deal of your comfort and happiness depends on having a good General. The last but one was nice: she used to make jolly good currant puddings for us, and let us have the dish on the floor and pretend it was a wild boar we were killing with our forks. But the General we have now nearly always makes sago puddings, and they are the watery kind, and you cannot pretend anything with them, not even islands, like you do with porridge. Then we left off going to school, and Father said we should go to a good school as soon as he could manage it. He said a holiday would do us all good. We thought he was right, but we wished he had told us he couldn’t afford it. For of course we knew. Then a great many people used to come to the door with envelopes with no stamps on them, and sometimes they got very angry, and said they were calling for the last time before putting it in other hands. I asked Eliza what that meant, and she kindly explained to me, and I was so sorry for Father. And once a long, blue paper came; a policeman brought it, and we were so frightened. But Father said it was all right, only when he went up to kiss the girls after they were in bed they said he had been crying, though I’m sure that’s not true. Because only cowards and snivellers cry, and my Father is the bravest man in the world. So you see it was time we looked for treasure and Oswald said so, and Dora said it was all very well. But the others agreed with Oswald. So we held a council. Dora was in the chair, the big dining-room chair, that we let the fireworks off from, the Fifth of November when we had the measles and couldn’t do it in the garden. The hole has never been mended, so now we have that chair in the nursery, and I think it was cheap at the blowing-up we boys got when the hole was burnt. ‘We must do something,’ said Alice, ‘because the exchequer is empty.’ She rattled the money-box as she spoke, and it really did rattle because we always keep the bad sixpence in it for luck. ‘Yes, but what shall we do?’ said Dicky. ‘It’s so jolly easy to say let’s do  something .’ Dicky always wants everything settled exactly. Father calls him the Definite Article. ‘Let’s read all the books again. We shall get lots of ideas out of them.’ It was Noel who suggested this, but we made him shut up, because we knew well enough he only wanted to get back to his old books. Noel is a poet. He sold some of his poetry once, and it was printed, but that does not come in this part of the story. Then Dicky said, ‘Look here. We’ll be quite quiet for ten minutes by the clock, and each think of some way to find treasure. And when we’ve thought we’ll try all the ways one after the other, beginning with the eldest.’ ‘I shan’t be able to think in ten minutes, make it half an hour,’ said H. O. His real name is Horace Octavius, but we call him H. O. because of the advertisement, and it’s not so very long ago he was afraid to pass the hoarding where it says ‘Eat H. O.’ in big letters. He says it was when he was a little boy, but I remember last Christmas but one, he woke in the middle of the night crying and howling, and they said it was the pudding. But he told me afterwards he had been dreaming that they really  had  come to eat H. O., and it couldn’t have been the pudding, when you come to think of it, because it was so very plain. Well, we made it half an hour, and we all sat quiet, and thought and thought. And I made up my mind before two minutes were over, and I saw the others had, all but Dora, who is always an awful time over everything. I got pins and needles in my leg from sitting still so long, and when it was seven minutes H. O. cried out, ‘Oh, it must be more than half an hour!’ H. O. is eight years old, but he cannot tell the clock yet. Oswald could tell the clock when he was six. We all stretched ourselves and began to speak at once, but Dora put up her hands to her ears and said,  ‘One at a time, please. We aren’t playing Babel.’ (It is a very good game. Did you ever play it?) So Dora made us all sit in a row on the floor, in ages, and then she pointed at us with the finger that had the brass thimble on. Her silver one got lost when the last General but two went away. We think she must have forgotten it was Dora’s and put it in her box by mistake. She was a very forgetful girl. She used to forget what she had spent money on, so that the change was never quite right. Oswald spoke first. ‘I think we might stop people on Blackheath, with crape masks and horse-pistols, and say “Your money or your life! Resistance is useless, we are armed to the teeth”, like Dick Turpin and Claude Duval. It wouldn’t matter about not having horses, because coaches have gone out too.’ Dora screwed up her nose the way she always does when she is going to talk like the good elder sister in books, and said, ‘That would be very wrong: it’s like pickpocketing or taking pennies out of Father’s great-coat when it’s hanging in the hall.’ I must say I don’t think she need have said that, especially before the little ones, for it was when I was only four. But Oswald was not going to let her see he cared, so he said,  ‘Oh, very well. I can think of lots of other ways. We could rescue an old gentleman from deadly Highwaymen.’ ‘There aren’t any,’ said Dora. ‘Oh, well, it’s all the same, from deadly peril, then. There’s plenty of that. Then he would turn out to be the Prince of Wales, and he would say, “My noble, my cherished preserver! Here is a million pounds a year. Rise up, Sir Oswald Bastable.”’ But the others did not seem to think so, and it was Alice’s turn to say. She said, ‘I think we might try the divining-rod. I’m sure I could do it. I’ve often read about it. You hold a stick in your hands, and when you come to where there is gold underneath the stick kicks about. So you know. And you dig.’ ‘Oh,’ said Dora suddenly, ‘I have an idea. But I’ll say last. I hope the divining-rod isn’t wrong. I believe it’s wrong in the Bible.’ ‘So is eating pork and ducks,’ said Dicky. ‘You can’t go by that.’ ‘Anyhow, we’ll try the other ways first,’ said Dora. ‘Now, H. O.’ ‘Let’s be Bandits,’ said H. O. ‘I dare say it’s wrong but it would be fun pretending.’ ‘I’m sure it’s wrong,’ said Dora. And Dicky said she thought everything wrong. She said she didn’t, and Dicky was very disagreeable. So Oswald had to make peace, and he said,  ‘Dora needn’t play if she doesn’t want to. Nobody asked her. And, Dicky, don’t be an idiot: do dry up and let’s hear what Noel’s idea is.’ Dora and Dicky did not look pleased, but I kicked Noel under the table to make him hurry up, and then he said he didn’t think he wanted to play any more. That’s the worst of it. The others are so jolly ready to quarrel. I told Noel to be a man and not a snivelling pig, and at last he said he had not made up his mind whether he would print his poetry in a book and sell it, or find a princess and marry her. ‘Whichever it is,’ he added, ‘none of you shall want for anything, though Oswald did kick me, and say I was a snivelling pig.’ ‘I didn’t,’ said Oswald, ‘I told you not to be.’ And Alice explained to him that that was quite the opposite of what he thought. So he agreed to drop it. Then Dicky spoke. ‘You must all of you have noticed the advertisements in the papers, telling you that ladies and gentlemen can easily earn two pounds a week in their spare time, and to send two shillings for sample and instructions, carefully packed free from observation. Now that we don’t go to school all our time is spare time. So I should think we could easily earn twenty pounds a week each. That would do us very well. We’ll try some of the other things first, and directly we have any money we’ll send for the sample and instructions. And I have another idea, but I must think about it before I say.’ We all said, ‘Out with it, what’s the other idea?’ But Dicky said, ‘No.’ That is Dicky all over. He never will show you anything he’s making till it’s quite finished, and the same with his inmost thoughts. But he is pleased if you seem to want to know, so Oswald said,  ‘Keep your silly old secret, then. Now, Dora, drive ahead. We’ve all said except you.’ Then Dora jumped up and dropped the stocking and the thimble (it rolled away, and we did not find it for days), and said,  ‘Let’s try my way  now . Besides, I’m the eldest, so it’s only fair. Let’s dig for treasure. Not any tiresome divining-rod, but just plain digging. People who dig for treasure always find it. And then we shall be rich and we needn’t try your ways at all. Some of them are rather difficult: and I’m certain some of them are wrong, and we must always remember that wrong things, ’ But we told her to shut up and come on, and she did. I couldn’t help wondering as we went down to the garden, why Father had never thought of digging there for treasure instead of going to his beastly office every day. CHAPTER 2. DIGGING FOR TREASURE I am afraid the last chapter was rather dull. It is always dull in books when people talk and talk, and don’t do anything, but I was obliged to put it in, or else you wouldn’t have understood all the rest. The best part of books is when things are happening. That is the best part of real things too. This is why I shall not tell you in this story about all the days when nothing happened. You will not catch me saying, ‘thus the sad days passed slowly by’, or ‘the years rolled on their weary course’, or ‘time went on’, because it is silly; of course time goes on, whether you say so or not. So I shall just tell you the nice, interesting parts, and in between you will understand that we had our meals and got up and went to bed, and dull things like that. It would be sickening to write all that down, though of course it happens. I said so to Albert-next-door’s uncle, who writes books, and he said, ‘Quite right, that’s what we call selection, a necessity of true art.’ And he is very clever indeed. So you see. I have often thought that if the people who write books for children knew a little more it would be better. I shall not tell you anything about us except what I should like to know about if I was reading the story and you were writing it. Albert’s uncle says I ought to have put this in the preface, but I never read prefaces, and it is not much good writing things just for people to skip. I wonder other authors have never thought of this. Well, when we had agreed to dig for treasure we all went down into the cellar and lighted the gas. Oswald would have liked to dig there, but it is stone flags. We looked among the old boxes and broken chairs and fenders and empty bottles and things, and at last we found the spades we had to dig in the sand with when we went to the seaside three years ago. They are not silly, babyish, wooden spades, that split if you look at them, but good iron, with a blue mark across the top of the iron part, and yellow wooden handles. We wasted a little time getting them dusted, because the girls wouldn’t dig with spades that had cobwebs on them. Girls would never do for African explorers or anything like that, they are too beastly particular. It was no use doing the thing by halves. We marked out a sort of square in the mouldy part of the garden, about three yards across, and began to dig. But we found nothing except worms and stones, and the ground was very hard. So we thought we’d try another part of the garden, and we found a place in the big round flower bed, where the ground was much softer. We thought we’d make a smaller hole to begin with, and it was much better. We dug and dug and dug, and it was jolly hard work! We got very hot digging, but we found nothing. Presently Albert-next-door looked over the wall. We do not like him very much, but we let him play with us sometimes, because his father is dead, and you must not be unkind to orphans, even if their mothers are alive. Albert is always very tidy. He wears frilly collars and velvet knickerbockers. I can’t think how he can bear to. So we said, ‘Hallo!’ And he said, ‘What are you up to?’ ‘We’re digging for treasure,’ said Alice; ‘an ancient parchment revealed to us the place of concealment. Come over and help us. When we have dug deep enough we shall find a great pot of red clay, full of gold and precious jewels.’ Albert-next-door only sniggered and said, ‘What silly nonsense!’ He cannot play properly at all. It is very strange, because he has a very nice uncle. You see, Albert-next-door doesn’t care for reading, and he has not read nearly so many books as we have, so he is very foolish and ignorant, but it cannot be helped, and you just have to put up with it when you want him to do anything. Besides, it is wrong to be angry with people for not being so clever as you are yourself. It is not always their faults. So Oswald said, ‘Come and dig! Then you shall share the treasure when we’ve found it.’ But he said, ‘I shan’t, I don’t like digging, and I’m just going in to my tea.’ ‘Come along and dig, there’s a good boy,’ Alice said. ‘You can use my spade. It’s much the best, ’ So he came along and dug, and when once he was over the wall we kept him at it, and we worked as well, of course, and the hole got deep. Pincher worked too, he is our dog and he is very good at digging. He digs for rats in the dustbin sometimes, and gets very dirty. But we love our dog, even when his face wants washing. ‘I expect we shall have to make a tunnel,’ Oswald said, ‘to reach the rich treasure.’ So he jumped into the hole and began to dig at one side. After that we took it in turns to dig at the tunnel, and Pincher was most useful in scraping the earth out of the tunnel, he does it with his back feet when you say ‘Rats!’ and he digs with his front ones, and burrows with his nose as well. At last the tunnel was nearly a yard long, and big enough to creep along to find the treasure, if only it had been a bit longer. Now it was Albert’s turn to go in and dig, but he funked it. ‘Take your turn like a man,’ said Oswald, nobody can say that Oswald doesn’t take his turn like a man. But Albert wouldn’t. So we had to make him, because it was only fair. ‘It’s quite easy,’ Alice said. ‘You just crawl in and dig with your hands. Then when you come out we can scrape out what you’ve done, with the spades. Come, be a man. You won’t notice it being dark in the tunnel if you shut your eyes tight. We’ve all been in except Dora, and she doesn’t like worms.’ ‘I don’t like worms neither.’ Albert-next-door said this; but we remembered how he had picked a fat red and black worm up in his fingers and thrown it at Dora only the day before. So we put him in. But he would not go in head first, the proper way, and dig with his hands as we had done, and though Oswald was angry at the time, for he hates snivellers, yet afterwards he owned that perhaps it was just as well. You should never be afraid to own that perhaps you were mistaken, but it is cowardly to do it unless you are quite sure you are in the wrong. ‘Let me go in feet first,’ said Albert-next-door. ‘I’ll dig with my boots, I will truly, honour bright.’ So we let him get in feet first, and he did it very slowly and at last he was in, and only his head sticking out into the hole; and all the rest of him in the tunnel. ‘Now dig with your boots,’ said Oswald; ‘and, Alice, do catch hold of Pincher, he’ll be digging again in another minute, and perhaps it would be uncomfortable for Albert if Pincher threw the mould into his eyes.’ You should always try to think of these little things. Thinking of other people’s comfort makes them like you. Alice held Pincher, and we all shouted, ‘Kick! dig with your feet, for all you’re worth!’ So Albert-next-door began to dig with his feet, and we stood on the ground over him, waiting, and all in a minute the ground gave way, and we tumbled together in a heap: and when we got up there was a little shallow hollow where we had been standing, and Albert-next-door was underneath, stuck quite fast, because the roof of the tunnel had tumbled in on him. He is a horribly unlucky boy to have anything to do with. It was dreadful the way he cried and screamed, though he had to own it didn’t hurt, only it was rather heavy and he couldn’t move his legs. We would have dug him out all right enough, in time, but he screamed so we were afraid the police would come, so Dicky climbed over the wall, to tell the cook there to tell Albert-next-door’s uncle he had been buried by mistake, and to come and help dig him out. Dicky was a long time gone. We wondered what had become of him, and all the while the screaming went on and on, for we had taken the loose earth off Albert’s face so that he could scream quite easily and comfortably. Presently Dicky came back and Albert-next-door’s uncle came with him. He has very long legs, and his hair is light and his face is brown. He has been to sea, but now he writes books. I like him. He told his nephew to stow it, so Albert did, and then he asked him if he was hurt, and Albert had to say he wasn’t, for though he is a coward, and very unlucky, he is not a liar like some boys are. ‘This promises to be a protracted if agreeable task,’ said Albert-next-door’s uncle, rubbing his hands and looking at the hole with Albert’s head in it. ‘I will get another spade,’ so he fetched the big spade out of the next-door garden tool-shed, and began to dig his nephew out. ‘Mind you keep very still,’ he said, ‘or I might chunk a bit out of you with the spade.’ Then after a while he said,  ‘I confess that I am not absolutely insensible to the dramatic interest of the situation. My curiosity is excited. I own that I should like to know how my nephew happened to be buried. But don’t tell me if you’d rather not. I suppose no force was used?’ ‘Only moral force,’ said Alice. They used to talk a lot about moral force at the High School where she went, and in case you don’t know what it means I’ll tell you that it is making people do what they don’t want to, just by slanging them, or laughing at them, or promising them things if they’re good. ‘Only moral force, eh?’ said Albert-next-door’s uncle. ‘Well?’ ‘Well,’ Dora said, ‘I’m very sorry it happened to Albert, I’d rather it had been one of us. It would have been my turn to go into the tunnel, only I don’t like worms, so they let me off. You see we were digging for treasure.’ ‘Yes,’ said Alice, ‘and I think we were just coming to the underground passage that leads to the secret hoard, when the tunnel fell in on Albert. He  is  so unlucky,’ and she sighed. Then Albert-next-door began to scream again, and his uncle wiped his face, his own face, not Albert’s, with his silk handkerchief, and then he put it in his trousers pocket. It seems a strange place to put a handkerchief, but he had his coat and waistcoat off and I suppose he wanted the handkerchief handy. Digging is warm work. He told Albert-next-door to drop it, or he wouldn’t proceed further in the matter, so Albert stopped screaming, and presently his uncle finished digging him out. Albert did look so funny, with his hair all dusty and his velvet suit covered with mould and his face muddy with earth and crying. We all said how sorry we were, but he wouldn’t say a word back to us. He was most awfully sick to think he’d been the one buried, when it might just as well have been one of us. I felt myself that it was hard lines. ‘So you were digging for treasure,’ said Albert-next-door’s uncle, wiping his face again with his handkerchief. ‘Well, I fear that your chances of success are small. I have made a careful study of the whole subject. What I don’t know about buried treasure is not worth knowing. And I never knew more than one coin buried in any one garden, and that is generally, Hullo, what’s that?’ He pointed to something shining in the hole he had just dragged Albert out of. Oswald picked it up. It was a half-crown. We looked at each other, speechless with surprise and delight, like in books. ‘Well, that’s lucky, at all events,’ said Albert-next-door’s uncle. ‘Let’s see, that’s fivepence each for you.’ ‘It’s fourpence, something; I can’t do fractions,’ said Dicky; ‘there are seven of us, you see.’ ‘Oh, you count Albert as one of yourselves on this occasion, eh?’ ‘Of course,’ said Alice; ‘and I say, he was buried after all. Why shouldn’t we let him have the odd somethings, and we’ll have fourpence each.’ We all agreed to do this, and told Albert-next-door we would bring his share as soon as we could get the half-crown changed. He cheered up a little at that, and his uncle wiped his face again, he did look hot, and began to put on his coat and waistcoat. When he had done it he stooped and picked up something. He held it up, and you will hardly believe it, but it is quite true, it was another half-crown! ‘To think that there should be two!’ he said; ‘in all my experience of buried treasure I never heard of such a thing!’ I wish Albert-next-door’s uncle would come treasure-seeking with us regularly; he must have very sharp eyes: for Dora says she was looking just the minute before at the very place where the second half-crown was picked up from, and  she  never saw it. CHAPTER 3. BEING DETECTIVES The next thing that happened to us was very interesting. It was as real as the half-crowns, not just pretending. I shall try to write it as like a real book as I can. Of course we have read Mr Sherlock Holmes, as well as the yellow-covered books with pictures outside that are so badly printed; and you get them for fourpence-halfpenny at the bookstall when the corners of them are beginning to curl up and get dirty, with people looking to see how the story ends when they are waiting for trains. I think this is most unfair to the boy at the bookstall. The books are written by a gentleman named Gaboriau, and Albert’s uncle says they are the worst translations in the world, and written in vile English. Of course they’re not like Kipling, but they’re jolly good stories. And we had just been reading a book by Dick Diddlington, that’s not his right name, but I know all about libel actions, so I shall not say what his name is really, because his books are rot. Only they put it into our heads to do what I am going to narrate. It was in September, and we were not to go to the seaside because it is so expensive, even if you go to Sheerness, where it is all tin cans and old boots and no sand at all. But every one else went, even the people next door, not Albert’s side, but the other. Their servant told Eliza they were all going to Scarborough, and next day sure enough all the blinds were down and the shutters up, and the milk was not left any more. There is a big horse-chestnut tree between their garden and ours, very useful for getting conkers out of and for making stuff to rub on your chilblains. This prevented our seeing whether the blinds were down at the back as well, but Dicky climbed to the top of the tree and looked, and they were. It was jolly hot weather, and very stuffy indoors, we used to play a good deal in the garden. We made a tent out of the kitchen clothes-horse and some blankets off our beds, and though it was quite as hot in the tent as in the house it was a very different sort of hotness. Albert’s uncle called it the Turkish Bath. It is not nice to be kept from the seaside, but we know that we have much to be thankful for. We might be poor little children living in a crowded alley where even at summer noon hardly a ray of sunlight penetrates; clothed in rags and with bare feet, though I do not mind holes in my clothes myself, and bare feet would not be at all bad in this sort of weather. Indeed we do, sometimes, when we are playing at things which require it. It was shipwrecked mariners that day, I remember, and we were all in the blanket tent. We had just finished eating the things we had saved, at the peril of our lives, from the st-sinking vessel. They were rather nice things. Two-pennyworth of coconut candy, it was got in Greenwich, where it is four ounces a penny, three apples, some macaroni, the straight sort that is so useful to suck things through, some raw rice, and a large piece of cold suet pudding that Alice nicked from the larder when she went to get the rice and macaroni. And when we had finished some one said,  ‘I should like to be a detective.’ I wish to be quite fair, but I cannot remember exactly who said it. Oswald thinks he said it, and Dora says it was Dicky, but Oswald is too much of a man to quarrel about a little thing like that. ‘I should like to be a detective,’ said, perhaps it was Dicky, but I think not, ‘and find out strange and hidden crimes.’ ‘You have to be much cleverer than you are,’ said H. O. ‘Not so very,’ Alice said, ‘because when you’ve read the books you know what the things mean: the red hair on the handle of the knife, or the grains of white powder on the velvet collar of the villain’s overcoat. I believe we could do it.’ ‘I shouldn’t like to have anything to do with murders,’ said Dora; ‘somehow it doesn’t seem safe, ’ ‘And it always ends in the poor murderer being hanged,’ said Alice. We explained to her why murderers have to be hanged, but she only said, ‘I don’t care. I’m sure no one would ever do murdering  twice . Think of the blood and things, and what you would see when you woke up in the night! I shouldn’t mind being a detective to lie in wait for a gang of coiners, now, and spring upon them unawares, and secure them, single-handed, you know, or with only my faithful bloodhound.’ She stroked Pincher’s ears, but he had gone to sleep because he knew well enough that all the suet pudding was finished. He is a very sensible dog. ‘You always get hold of the wrong end of the stick,’ Oswald said. ‘You can’t choose what crimes you’ll be a detective about. You just have to get a suspicious circumstance, and then you look for a clue and follow it up. Whether it turns out a murder or a missing will is just a fluke.’ ‘That’s one way,’ Dicky said. ‘Another is to get a paper and find two advertisements or bits of news that fit. Like this: “Young Lady Missing,” and then it tells about all the clothes she had on, and the gold locket she wore, and the colour of her hair, and all that; and then in another piece of the paper you see, “Gold locket found,” and then it all comes out.’ We sent H. O. for the paper at once, but we could not make any of the things fit in. The two best were about how some burglars broke into a place in Holloway where they made preserved tongues and invalid delicacies, and carried off a lot of them. And on another page there was, ‘Mysterious deaths in Holloway.’ Oswald thought there was something in it, and so did Albert’s uncle when we asked him, but the others thought not, so Oswald agreed to drop it. Besides, Holloway is a long way off. All the time we were talking about the paper Alice seemed to be thinking about something else, and when we had done she said,  ‘I believe we might be detectives ourselves, but I should not like to get anybody into trouble.’ ‘Not murderers or robbers?’ Dicky asked. ‘It wouldn’t be murderers,’ she said; ‘but I  have  noticed something strange. Only I feel a little frightened. Let’s ask Albert’s uncle first.’ Alice is a jolly sight too fond of asking grown-up people things. And we all said it was tommyrot, and she was to tell us. ‘Well, promise you won’t do anything without me,’ Alice said, and we promised. Then she said,  ‘This is a dark secret, and any one who thinks it is better not to be involved in a career of crime-discovery had better go away ere yet it be too late.’ So Dora said she had had enough of tents, and she was going to look at the shops. H. O. went with her because he had twopence to spend. They thought it was only a game of Alice’s but Oswald knew by the way she spoke. He can nearly always tell. And when people are not telling the truth Oswald generally knows by the way they look with their eyes. Oswald is not proud of being able to do this. He knows it is through no merit of his own that he is much cleverer than some people. When they had gone, the rest of us got closer together and said,  ‘Now then.’ ‘Well,’ Alice said, ‘you know the house next door? The people have gone to Scarborough. And the house is shut up. But last night  I saw a light in the windows .’ We asked her how and when, because her room is in the front, and she couldn’t possibly have seen. And then she said,  ‘I’ll tell you if you boys will promise not ever to go fishing again without me.’ So we had to promise. Then she said,  ‘It was last night. I had forgotten to feed my rabbits and I woke up and remembered it. And I was afraid I should find them dead in the morning, like Oswald did.’ ‘It wasn’t my fault,’ Oswald said; ‘there was something the matter with the beasts. I fed them right enough.’ Alice said she didn’t mean that, and she went on,  ‘I came down into the garden, and I saw a light in the house, and dark figures moving about. I thought perhaps it was burglars, but Father hadn’t come home, and Eliza had gone to bed, so I couldn’t do anything. Only I thought perhaps I would tell the rest of you.’ ‘Why didn’t you tell us this morning?’ Noel asked. And Alice explained that she did not want to get any one into trouble, even burglars. ‘But we might watch to-night,’ she said, ‘and see if we see the light again.’ ‘They might have been burglars,’ Noel said. He was sucking the last bit of his macaroni. ‘You know the people next door are very grand. They won’t know us, and they go out in a real private carriage sometimes. And they have an “At Home” day, and people come in cabs. I daresay they have piles of plate and jewellery and rich brocades, and furs of price and things like that. Let us keep watch to-night.’ ‘It’s no use watching to-night,’ Dicky said; ‘if it’s only burglars they won’t come again. But there are other things besides burglars that are discovered in empty houses where lights are seen moving.’ ‘You mean coiners,’ said Oswald at once. ‘I wonder what the reward is for setting the police on their track?’ Dicky thought it ought to be something fat, because coiners are always a desperate gang; and the machinery they make the coins with is so heavy and handy for knocking down detectives. Then it was tea-time, and we went in; and Dora and H. O. had clubbed their money together and bought a melon; quite a big one, and only a little bit squashy at one end. It was very good, and then we washed the seeds and made things with them and with pins and cotton. And nobody said any more about watching the house next door. Only when we went to bed Dicky took off his coat and waistcoat, but he stopped at his braces, and said,  ‘What about the coiners?’ Oswald had taken off his collar and tie, and he was just going to say the same, so he said, ‘Of course I meant to watch, only my collar’s rather tight, so I thought I’d take it off first.’ Dicky said he did not think the girls ought to be in it, because there might be danger, but Oswald reminded him that they had promised Alice, and that a promise is a sacred thing, even when you’d much rather not. So Oswald got Alice alone under pretence of showing her a caterpillar, Dora does not like them, and she screamed and ran away when Oswald offered to show it her. Then Oswald explained, and Alice agreed to come and watch if she could. This made us later than we ought to have been, because Alice had to wait till Dora was quiet and then creep out very slowly, for fear of the boards creaking. The girls sleep with their room-door open for fear of burglars. Alice had kept on her clothes under her nightgown when Dora wasn’t looking, and presently we got down, creeping past Father’s study, and out at the glass door that leads on to the veranda and the iron steps into the garden. And we went down very quietly, and got into the chestnut-tree; and then I felt that we had only been playing what Albert’s uncle calls our favourite instrument, I mean the Fool. For the house next door was as dark as dark. Then suddenly we heard a sound, it came from the gate at the end of the garden. All the gardens have gates; they lead into a kind of lane that runs behind them. It is a sort of back way, very convenient when you don’t want to say exactly where you are going. We heard the gate at the end of the next garden click, and Dicky nudged Alice so that she would have fallen out of the tree if it had not been for Oswald’s extraordinary presence of mind. Oswald squeezed Alice’s arm tight, and we all looked; and the others were rather frightened because really we had not exactly expected anything to happen except perhaps a light. But now a muffled figure, shrouded in a dark cloak, came swiftly up the path of the next-door garden. And we could see that under its cloak the figure carried a mysterious burden. The figure was dressed to look like a woman in a sailor hat. We held our breath as it passed under the tree where we were, and then it tapped very gently on the back door and was let in, and then a light appeared in the window of the downstairs back breakfast-room. But the shutters were up. Dicky said, ‘My eye!’ and wouldn’t the others be sick to think they hadn’t been in this! But Alice didn’t half like it, and as she is a girl I do not blame her. Indeed, I thought myself at first that perhaps it would be better to retire for the present, and return later with a strongly armed force. ‘It’s not burglars,’ Alice whispered; ‘the mysterious stranger was bringing things in, not taking them out. They must be coiners, and oh, Oswald!, don’t let’s! The things they coin with must hurt very much. Do let’s go to bed!’ But Dicky said he was going to see; if there was a reward for finding out things like this he would like to have the reward. ‘They locked the back door,’ he whispered, ‘I heard it go. And I could look in quite well through the holes in the shutters and be back over the wall long before they’d got the door open, even if they started to do it at once.’ There were holes at the top of the shutters the shape of hearts, and the yellow light came out through them as well as through the chinks of the shutters. Oswald said if Dicky went he should, because he was the eldest; and Alice said, ‘If any one goes it ought to be me, because I thought of it.’ So Oswald said, ‘Well, go then’; and she said, ‘Not for anything!’ And she begged us not to, and we talked about it in the tree till we were all quite hoarse with whispering. At last we decided on a plan of action. Alice was to stay in the tree, and scream ‘Murder!’ if anything happened. Dicky and I were to get down into the next garden and take it in turns to peep. So we got down as quietly as we could, but the tree made much more noise than it does in the day, and several times we paused, fearing that all was discovered. But nothing happened. There was a pile of red flower-pots under the window and one very large one was on the window-ledge. It seemed as if it was the hand of Destiny had placed it there, and the geranium in it was dead, and there was nothing to stop your standing on it, so Oswald did. He went first because he is the eldest, and though Dicky tried to stop him because he thought of it first it could not be, on account of not being able to say anything. So Oswald stood on the flower-pot and tried to look through one of the holes. He did not really expect to see the coiners at their fell work, though he had pretended to when we were talking in the tree. But if he had seen them pouring the base molten metal into tin moulds the shape of half-crowns he would not have been half so astonished as he was at the spectacle now revealed. At first he could see little, because the hole had unfortunately been made a little too high, so that the eye of the detective could only see the Prodigal Son in a shiny frame on the opposite wall. But Oswald held on to the window-frame and stood on tiptoe and then he  saw . There was no furnace, and no base metal, no bearded men in leathern aprons with tongs and things, but just a table with a table-cloth on it for supper, and a tin of salmon and a lettuce and some bottled beer. And there on a chair was the cloak and the hat of the mysterious stranger, and the two people sitting at the table were the two youngest grown-up daughters of the lady next door, and one of them was saying,  ‘So I got the salmon three-halfpence cheaper, and the lettuces are only six a penny in the Broadway, just fancy! We must save as much as ever we can on our housekeeping money if we want to go away decent next year.’ And the other said, ‘I wish we could  all  go  every  year, or else, Really, I almost wish, ’ And all the time Oswald was looking Dicky was pulling at his jacket to make him get down and let Dicky have a squint. And just as she said ‘I almost,’ Dicky pulled too hard and Oswald felt himself toppling on the giddy verge of the big flower-pots. Putting forth all his strength our hero strove to recover his equi-what’s-its-name, but it was now lost beyond recall. ‘You’ve done it this time!’ he said, then he fell heavily among the flower-pots piled below. He heard them crash and rattle and crack, and then his head struck against an iron pillar used for holding up the next-door veranda. His eyes closed and he knew no more. Now you will perhaps expect that at this moment Alice would have cried ‘Murder!’ If you think so you little know what girls are. Directly she was left alone in that tree she made a bolt to tell Albert’s uncle all about it and bring him to our rescue in case the coiner’s gang was a very desperate one. And just when I fell, Albert’s uncle was getting over the wall. Alice never screamed at all when Oswald fell, but Dicky thinks he heard Albert’s uncle say, ‘Confound those kids!’ which would not have been kind or polite, so I hope he did not say it. The people next door did not come out to see what the row was. Albert’s uncle did not wait for them to come out. He picked up Oswald and carried the insensible body of the gallant young detective to the wall, laid it on the top, and then climbed over and bore his lifeless burden into our house and put it on the sofa in Father’s study. Father was out, so we needn’t have  crept  so when we were getting into the garden. Then Oswald was restored to consciousness, and his head tied up, and sent to bed, and next day there was a lump on his young brow as big as a turkey’s egg, and very uncomfortable. Albert’s uncle came in next day and talked to each of us separately. To Oswald he said many unpleasant things about ungentlemanly to spy on ladies, and about minding your own business; and when I began to tell him what I had heard he told me to shut up, and altogether he made me more uncomfortable than the bump did. Oswald did not say anything to any one, but next day, as the shadows of eve were falling, he crept away, and wrote on a piece of paper, ‘I want to speak to you,’ and shoved it through the hole like a heart in the top of the next-door shutters. And the youngest young lady put an eye to the heart-shaped hole, and then opened the shutter and said ‘Well?’ very crossly. Then Oswald said,  ‘I am very sorry, and I beg your pardon. We wanted to be detectives, and we thought a gang of coiners infested your house, so we looked through your window last night. I saw the lettuce, and I heard what you said about the salmon being three-halfpence cheaper, and I know it is very dishonourable to pry into other people’s secrets, especially ladies’, and I never will again if you will forgive me this once.’ Then the lady frowned and then she laughed, and then she said,  ‘So it was you tumbling into the flower-pots last night? We thought it was burglars. It frightened us horribly. Why, what a bump on your poor head!’ And then she talked to me a bit, and presently she said she and her sister had not wished people to know they were at home, because, And then she stopped short and grew very red, and I said, ‘I thought you were all at Scarborough; your servant told Eliza so. Why didn’t you want people to know you were at home?’ The lady got redder still, and then she laughed and said,  ‘Never mind the reason why. I hope your head doesn’t hurt much. Thank you for your nice, manly little speech.  You’ve  nothing to be ashamed of, at any rate.’ Then she kissed me, and I did not mind. And then she said, ‘Run away now, dear. I’m going to, I’m going to pull up the blinds and open the shutters, and I want to do it at  once , before it gets dark, so that every one can see we’re at home, and not at Scarborough.’ CHAPTER 4. GOOD HUNTING When we had got that four shillings by digging for treasure we ought, by rights, to have tried Dicky’s idea of answering the advertisement about ladies and gentlemen and spare time and two pounds a week, but there were several things we rather wanted. Dora wanted a new pair of scissors, and she said she was going to get them with her eight-pence. But Alice said,  ‘You ought to get her those, Oswald, because you know you broke the points off hers getting the marble out of the brass thimble.’ It was quite true, though I had almost forgotten it, but then it was H. O. who jammed the marble into the thimble first of all. So I said,  ‘It’s H. O.’s fault as much as mine, anyhow. Why shouldn’t he pay?’ Oswald didn’t so much mind paying for the beastly scissors, but he hates injustice of every kind. ‘He’s such a little kid,’ said Dicky, and of course H. O. said he wasn’t a little kid, and it very nearly came to being a row between them. But Oswald knows when to be generous; so he said,  ‘Look here! I’ll pay sixpence of the scissors, and H. O. shall pay the rest, to teach him to be careful.’ H. O. agreed: he is not at all a mean kid, but I found out afterwards that Alice paid his share out of her own money. Then we wanted some new paints, and Noel wanted a pencil and a halfpenny account-book to write poetry with, and it does seem hard never to have any apples. So, somehow or other nearly all the money got spent, and we agreed that we must let the advertisement run loose a little longer. ‘I only hope,’ Alice said, ‘that they won’t have got all the ladies and gentlemen they want before we have got the money to write for the sample and instructions.’ And I was a little afraid myself, because it seemed such a splendid chance; but we looked in the paper every day, and the advertisement was always there, so we thought it was all right. Then we had the detective try-on, and it proved no go; and then, when all the money was gone, except a halfpenny of mine and twopence of Noel’s and three-pence of Dicky’s and a few pennies that the girls had left, we held another council. Dora was sewing the buttons on H. O.’s Sunday things. He got himself a knife with his money, and he cut every single one of his best buttons off. You’ve no idea how many buttons there are on a suit. Dora counted them. There are twenty-four, counting the little ones on the sleeves that don’t undo. Alice was trying to teach Pincher to beg; but he has too much sense when he knows you’ve got nothing in your hands, and the rest of us were roasting potatoes under the fire. We had made a fire on purpose, though it was rather warm. They are very good if you cut away the burnt parts, but you ought to wash them first, or you are a dirty boy. ‘Well, what can we do?’ said Dicky. ‘You are so fond of saying “Let’s do something!” and never saying what.’ ‘We can’t try the advertisement yet. Shall we try rescuing some one?’ said Oswald. It was his own idea, but he didn’t insist on doing it, though he is next to the eldest, for he knows it is bad manners to make people do what you want, when they would rather not. ‘What was Noel’s plan?’ Alice asked. ‘A Princess or a poetry book,’ said Noel sleepily. He was lying on his back on the sofa, kicking his legs. ‘Only I shall look for the Princess all by myself. But I’ll let you see her when we’re married.’ ‘Have you got enough poetry to make a book?’ Dicky asked that, and it was rather sensible of him, because when Noel came to look there were only seven of his poems that any of us could understand. There was the ‘Wreck of the Malabar’, and the poem he wrote when Eliza took us to hear the Reviving Preacher, and everybody cried, and Father said it must have been the Preacher’s Eloquence. So Noel wrote:     O Eloquence and what art thou?     Ay what art thou? because we cried     And everybody cried inside     When they came out their eyes were red,      And it was your doing Father said. But Noel told Alice he got the first line and a half from a book a boy at school was going to write when he had time. Besides this there were the ‘Lines on a Dead Black Beetle that was poisoned’,      O Beetle how I weep to see        Thee lying on thy poor back!     It is so very sad indeed.        You were so shiny and black.     I wish you were alive again     But Eliza says wishing it is nonsense and a shame. It was very good beetle poison, and there were hundreds of them lying dead, but Noel only wrote a piece of poetry for one of them. He said he hadn’t time to do them all, and the worst of it was he didn’t know which one he’d written it to, so Alice couldn’t bury the beetle and put the lines on its grave, though she wanted to very much. Well, it was quite plain that there wasn’t enough poetry for a book. ‘We might wait a year or two,’ said Noel. ‘I shall be sure to make some more some time. I thought of a piece about a fly this morning that knew condensed milk was sticky.’ ‘But we want the money  now ,’ said Dicky, ‘and you can go on writing just the same. It will come in some time or other.’ ‘There’s poetry in newspapers,’ said Alice. ‘Down, Pincher! you’ll never be a clever dog, so it’s no good trying.’ ‘Do they pay for it?’ Dicky thought of that; he often thinks of things that are really important, even if they are a little dull. ‘I don’t know. But I shouldn’t think any one would let them print their poetry without. I wouldn’t I know.’ That was Dora; but Noel said he wouldn’t mind if he didn’t get paid, so long as he saw his poetry printed and his name at the end. ‘We might try, anyway,’ said Oswald. He is always willing to give other people’s ideas a fair trial. So we copied out ‘The Wreck of the Malabar’ and the other six poems on drawing-paper, Dora did it, she writes best, and Oswald drew a picture of the Malabar going down with all hands. It was a full-rigged schooner, and all the ropes and sails were correct; because my cousin is in the Navy, and he showed me. We thought a long time whether we’d write a letter and send it by post with the poetry, and Dora thought it would be best. But Noel said he couldn’t bear not to know at once if the paper would print the poetry, So we decided to take it. I went with Noel, because I am the eldest, and he is not old enough to go to London by himself. Dicky said poetry was rot, and he was glad he hadn’t got to make a fool of himself. That was because there was not enough money for him to go with us. H. O. couldn’t come either, but he came to the station to see us off, and waved his cap and called out ‘Good hunting!’ as the train started. There was a lady in spectacles in the corner. She was writing with a pencil on the edges of long strips of paper that had print all down them. When the train started she asked,  ‘What was that he said?’ So Oswald answered,  ‘It was “Good hunting”, it’s out of the Jungle Book!’ ‘That’s very pleasant to hear,’ the lady said; ‘I am very pleased to meet people who know their Jungle Book. And where are you off to, the Zoological Gardens to look for Bagheera?’ We were pleased, too, to meet some one who knew the Jungle Book. So Oswald said,  ‘We are going to restore the fallen fortunes of the House of Bastable, and we have all thought of different ways, and we’re going to try them all. Noel’s way is poetry. I suppose great poets get paid?’ The lady laughed, she was awfully jolly, and said she was a sort of poet, too, and the long strips of paper were the proofs of her new book of stories. Because before a book is made into a real book with pages and a cover, they sometimes print it all on strips of paper, and the writer make marks on it with a pencil to show the printers what idiots they are not to understand what a writer means to have printed. We told her all about digging for treasure, and what we meant to do. Then she asked to see Noel’s poetry, and he said he didn’t like, so she said, ‘Look here, if you’ll show me yours I’ll show you some of mine.’ So he agreed. The jolly lady read Noel’s poetry, and she said she liked it very much. And she thought a great deal of the picture of the Malabar. And then she said, ‘I write serious poetry like yours myself; too, but I have a piece here that I think you will like because it’s about a boy.’ She gave it to us, and so I can copy it down, and I will, for it shows that some grown-up ladies are not so silly as others. I like it better than Noel’s poetry, though I told him I did not, because he looked as if he was going to cry. This was very wrong, for you should always speak the truth, however unhappy it makes people. And I generally do. But I did not want him crying in the railway carriage. The lady’s piece of poetry:     Oh when I wake up in my bed     And see the sun all fat and red,     I’m glad to have another day     For all my different kinds of play.     There are so many things to do,      The things that make a man of you,     If grown-ups did not get so vexed     And wonder what you will do next.     I often wonder whether they     Ever made up our kinds of play,      If they were always good as gold     And only did what they were told.     They like you best to play with tops     And toys in boxes, bought in shops;     They do not even know the names     Of really interesting games.     They will not let you play with fire     Or trip your sister up with wire,     They grudge the tea-tray for a drum,     Or booby-traps when callers come.     They don’t like fishing, and it’s true     You sometimes soak a suit or two:     They look on fireworks, though they’re dry,     With quite a disapproving eye.     They do not understand the way     To get the most out of your day:     They do not know how hunger feels     Nor what you need between your meals.     And when you’re sent to bed at night,     They’re happy, but they’re not polite.     For through the door you hear them say:     ‘ He’s  done  his  mischief for the day!’ She told us a lot of other pieces but I cannot remember them, and she talked to us all the way up, and when we got nearly to Cannon Street she said,  ‘I’ve got two new shillings here! Do you think they would help to smooth the path to Fame?’ Noel said, ‘Thank you,’ and was going to take the shilling. But Oswald, who always remembers what he is told, said,  ‘Thank you very much, but Father told us we ought never to take anything from strangers.’ ‘That’s a nasty one,’ said the lady, she didn’t talk a bit like a real lady, but more like a jolly sort of grown-up boy in a dress and hat, ‘a very nasty one! But don’t you think as Noel and I are both poets I might be considered a sort of relation? You’ve heard of brother poets, haven’t you? Don’t you think Noel and I are aunt and nephew poets, or some relationship of that kind?’ I didn’t know what to say, and she went on,  ‘It’s awfully straight of you to stick to what your Father tells you, but look here, you take the shillings, and here’s my card. When you get home tell your Father all about it, and if he says No, you can just bring the shillings back to me.’ So we took the shillings, and she shook hands with us and said, ‘Good-bye, and good hunting!’ We did tell Father about it, and he said it was all right, and when he looked at the card he told us we were highly honoured, for the lady wrote better poetry than any other lady alive now. We had never heard of her, and she seemed much too jolly for a poet. Good old Kipling! We owe him those two shillings, as well as the Jungle books! CHAPTER 5. THE POET AND THE EDITOR It was not bad sport, being in London entirely on our own hook. We asked the way to Fleet Street, where Father says all the newspaper offices are. They said straight on down Ludgate Hill, but it turned out to be quite another way. At least  we  didn’t go straight on. We got to St Paul’s. Noel  would  go in, and we saw where Gordon was buried, at least the monument. It is very flat, considering what a man he was. When we came out we walked a long way, and when we asked a policeman he said we’d better go back through Smithfield. So we did. They don’t burn people any more there now, so it was rather dull, besides being a long way, and Noel got very tired. He’s a peaky little chap; it comes of being a poet, I think. We had a bun or two at different shops, out of the shillings, and it was quite late in the afternoon when we got to Fleet Street. The gas was lighted and the electric lights. There is a jolly Bovril sign that comes off and on in different coloured lamps. We went to the Daily Recorder office, and asked to see the Editor. It is a big office, very bright, with brass and mahogany and electric lights. They told us the Editor wasn’t there, but at another office. So we went down a dirty street, to a very dull-looking place. There was a man there inside, in a glass case, as if he was a museum, and he told us to write down our names and our business. So Oswald wrote,             OSWALD BASTABLE             NOEL BASTABLE       BUSINESS VERY PRIVATE INDEED Then we waited on the stone stairs; it was very draughty. And the man in the glass case looked at us as if we were the museum instead of him. We waited a long time, and then a boy came down and said,  ‘The Editor can’t see you. Will you please write your business?’ And he laughed. I wanted to punch his head. But Noel said, ‘Yes, I’ll write it if you’ll give me a pen and ink, and a sheet of paper and an envelope.’ The boy said he’d better write by post. But Noel is a bit pig-headed; it’s his worst fault. So he said, ‘No, I’ll write it  now .’ So I backed him up by saying,  ‘Look at the price penny stamps are since the coal strike!’ So the boy grinned, and the man in the glass case gave us pen and paper, and Noel wrote. Oswald writes better than he does; but Noel would do it; and it took a very long time, and then it was inky.     DEAR MR EDITOR, I want you to print my poetry and pay for it,     and I am a friend of Mrs Leslie’s; she is a poet too.     Your affectionate friend,     NOEL BASTABLE. He licked the envelope a good deal, so that that boy shouldn’t read it going upstairs; and he wrote ‘Very private’ outside, and gave the letter to the boy. I thought it wasn’t any good; but in a minute the grinning boy came back, and he was quite respectful, and said, ‘The Editor says, please will you step up?’ We stepped up. There were a lot of stairs and passages, and a queer sort of humming, hammering sound and a very funny smell. The boy was now very polite, and said it was the ink we smelt, and the noise was the printing machines. After going through a lot of cold passages we came to a door; the boy opened it, and let us go in. There was a large room, with a big, soft, blue-and-red carpet, and a roaring fire, though it was only October; and a large table with drawers, and littered with papers, just like the one in Father’s study. A gentleman was sitting at one side of the table; he had a light moustache and light eyes, and he looked very young to be an editor, not nearly so old as Father. He looked very tired and sleepy, as if he had got up very early in the morning; but he was kind, and we liked him. Oswald thought he looked clever. Oswald is considered a judge of faces. ‘Well,’ said he, ‘so you are Mrs Leslie’s friends?’ ‘I think so,’ said Noel; ‘at least she gave us each a shilling, and she wished us “good hunting!”’ ‘Good hunting, eh? Well, what about this poetry of yours? Which is the poet?’ I can’t think how he could have asked! Oswald is said to be a very manly-looking boy for his age. However, I thought it would look duffing to be offended, so I said,  ‘This is my brother Noel. He is the poet.’ Noel had turned quite pale. He is disgustingly like a girl in some ways. The Editor told us to sit down, and he took the poems from Noel, and began to read them. Noel got paler and paler; I really thought he was going to faint, like he did when I held his hand under the cold-water tap, after I had accidentally cut him with my chisel. When the Editor had read the first poem, it was the one about the beetle, he got up and stood with his back to us. It was not manners; but Noel thinks he did it ‘to conceal his emotion,’ as they do in books. He read all the poems, and then he said,  ‘I like your poetry very much, young man. I’ll give you, let me see; how much shall I give you for it?’ ‘As much as ever you can,’ said Noel. ‘You see I want a good deal of money to restore the fallen fortunes of the house of Bastable.’ The gentleman put on some eye-glasses and looked hard at us. Then he sat down. ‘That’s a good idea,’ said he. ‘Tell me how you came to think of it. And, I say, have you had any tea? They’ve just sent out for mine.’ He rang a tingly bell, and the boy brought in a tray with a teapot and a thick cup and saucer and things, and he had to fetch another tray for us, when he was told to; and we had tea with the Editor of the Daily Recorder. I suppose it was a very proud moment for Noel, though I did not think of that till afterwards. The Editor asked us a lot of questions, and we told him a good deal, though of course I did not tell a stranger all our reasons for thinking that the family fortunes wanted restoring. We stayed about half an hour, and when we were going away he said again,  ‘I shall print all your poems, my poet; and now what do you think they’re worth?’ ‘I don’t know,’ Noel said. ‘You see I didn’t write them to sell.’ ‘Why did you write them then?’ he asked. Noel said he didn’t know; he supposed because he wanted to. ‘Art for Art’s sake, eh?’ said the Editor, and he seemed quite delighted, as though Noel had said something clever. ‘Well, would a guinea meet your views?’ he asked. I have read of people being at a loss for words, and dumb with emotion, and I’ve read of people being turned to stone with astonishment, or joy, or something, but I never knew how silly it looked till I saw Noel standing staring at the Editor with his mouth open. He went red and he went white, and then he got crimson, as if you were rubbing more and more crimson lake on a palette. But he didn’t say a word, so Oswald had to say,  ‘I should jolly well think so.’ So the Editor gave Noel a sovereign and a shilling, and he shook hands with us both, but he thumped Noel on the back and said,  ‘Buck up, old man! It’s your first guinea, but it won’t be your last. Now go along home, and in about ten years you can bring me some more poetry. Not before, see? I’m just taking this poetry of yours because I like it very much; but we don’t put poetry in this paper at all. I shall have to put it in another paper I know of.’ ‘What  do  you put in your paper?’ I asked, for Father always takes the Daily Chronicle, and I didn’t know what the Recorder was like. We chose it because it has such a glorious office, and a clock outside lighted up. ‘Oh, news,’ said he, ‘and dull articles, and things about Celebrities. If you know any Celebrities, now?’ Noel asked him what Celebrities were. ‘Oh, the Queen and the Princes, and people with titles, and people who write, or sing, or act, or do something clever or wicked.’ ‘I don’t know anybody wicked,’ said Oswald, wishing he had known Dick Turpin, or Claude Duval, so as to be able to tell the Editor things about them. ‘But I know some one with a title, Lord Tottenham.’ ‘The mad old Protectionist, eh? How did you come to know him?’ ‘We don’t know him to speak to. But he goes over the Heath every day at three, and he strides along like a giant, with a black cloak like Lord Tennyson’s flying behind him, and he talks to himself like one o’clock.’ ‘What does he say?’ The Editor had sat down again, and he was fiddling with a blue pencil. ‘We only heard him once, close enough to understand, and then he said, “The curse of the country, sir, ruin and desolation!” And then he went striding along again, hitting at the furze-bushes as if they were the heads of his enemies.’ ‘Excellent descriptive touch,’ said the Editor. ‘Well, go on.’ ‘That’s all I know about him, except that he stops in the middle of the Heath every day, and he looks all round to see if there’s any one about, and if there isn’t, he takes his collar off.’ The Editor interrupted, which is considered rude, and said,  ‘You’re not romancing?’ ‘I beg your pardon?’ said Oswald. ‘Drawing the long bow, I mean,’ said the Editor. Oswald drew himself up, and said he wasn’t a liar. The Editor only laughed, and said romancing and lying were not at all the same; only it was important to know what you were playing at. So Oswald accepted his apology, and went on. ‘We were hiding among the furze-bushes one day, and we saw him do it. He took off his collar, and he put on a clean one, and he threw the other among the furze-bushes. We picked it up afterwards, and it was a beastly paper one!’ ‘Thank you,’ said the Editor, and he got up and put his hand in his pocket. ‘That’s well worth five shillings, and there they are. Would you like to see round the printing offices before you go home?’ I pocketed my five bob, and thanked him, and I said we should like it very much. He called another gentleman and said something we couldn’t hear. Then he said good-bye again; and all this time Noel hadn’t said a word. But now he said, ‘I’ve made a poem about you. It is called “Lines to a Noble Editor.” Shall I write it down?’ The Editor gave him the blue pencil, and he sat down at the Editor’s table and wrote. It was this, he told me afterwards as well as he could remember,      May Life’s choicest blessings be your lot     I think you ought to be very blest     For you are going to print my poems,      And you may have this one as well as the rest. ‘Thank you,’ said the Editor. ‘I don’t think I ever had a poem addressed to me before. I shall treasure it, I assure you.’ Then the other gentleman said something about Maecenas, and we went off to see the printing office with at least one pound seven in our pockets. It  was  good hunting, and no mistake! But he never put Noel’s poetry in the Daily Recorder. It was quite a long time afterwards we saw a sort of story thing in a magazine, on the station bookstall, and that kind, sleepy-looking Editor had written it, I suppose. It was not at all amusing. It said a lot about Noel and me, describing us all wrong, and saying how we had tea with the Editor; and all Noel’s poems were in the story thing. I think myself the Editor seemed to make game of them, but Noel was quite pleased to see them printed, so that’s all right. It wasn’t my poetry anyhow, I am glad to say. CHAPTER 6. NOEL’S PRINCESS She happened quite accidentally. We were not looking for a Princess at all just then; but Noel had said he was going to find a Princess all by himself; and marry her, and he really did. Which was rather odd, because when people say things are going to befall, very often they don’t. It was different, of course, with the prophets of old. We did not get any treasure by it, except twelve chocolate drops; but we might have done, and it was an adventure, anyhow. Greenwich Park is a jolly good place to play in, especially the parts that aren’t near Greenwich. The parts near the Heath are first-rate. I often wish the Park was nearer our house; but I suppose a Park is a difficult thing to move. Sometimes we get Eliza to put lunch in a basket, and we go up to the Park. She likes that, it saves cooking dinner for us; and sometimes she says of her own accord, ‘I’ve made some pasties for you, and you might as well go into the Park as not. It’s a lovely day.’ She always tells us to rinse out the cup at the drinking-fountain, and the girls do; but I always put my head under the tap and drink. Then you are an intrepid hunter at a mountain stream, and besides, you’re sure it’s clean. Dicky does the same, and so does H. O. But Noel always drinks out of the cup. He says it is a golden goblet wrought by enchanted gnomes. The day the Princess happened was a fine, hot day, last October, and we were quite tired with the walk up to the Park. We always go in by the little gate at the top of Croom’s Hill. It is the postern gate that things always happen at in stories. It was dusty walking, but when we got in the Park it was ripping, so we rested a bit, and lay on our backs, and looked up at the trees, and wished we could play monkeys. I have done it before now, but the Park-keeper makes a row if he catches you. When we’d rested a little, Alice said,  ‘It was a long way to the enchanted wood, but it is very nice now we are there. I wonder what we shall find in it?’ ‘We shall find deer,’ said Dicky, ‘if we go to look; but they go on the other side of the Park because of the people with buns.’ Saying buns made us think of lunch, so we had it; and when we had done we scratched a hole under a tree and buried the papers, because we know it spoils pretty places to leave beastly, greasy papers lying about. I remember Mother teaching me and Dora that, when we were quite little. I wish everybody’s parents would teach them this useful lesson, and the same about orange peel. When we’d eaten everything there was, Alice whispered,  ‘I see the white witch bear yonder among the trees! Let’s track it and slay it in its lair.’ ‘I am the bear,’ said Noel; so he crept away, and we followed him among the trees. Often the witch bear was out of sight, and then you didn’t know where it would jump out from; but sometimes we saw it, and just followed. ‘When we catch it there’ll be a great fight,’ said Oswald; ‘and I shall be Count Folko of Mont Faucon.’ ‘I’ll be Gabrielle,’ said Dora. She is the only one of us who likes doing girl’s parts. ‘I’ll be Sintram,’ said Alice; ‘and H. O. can be the Little Master.’ ‘What about Dicky?’ ‘Oh, I can be the Pilgrim with the bones.’ ‘Hist!’ whispered Alice. ‘See his white fairy fur gleaming amid yonder covert!’ And I saw a bit of white too. It was Noel’s collar, and it had come undone at the back. We hunted the bear in and out of the trees, and then we lost him altogether; and suddenly we found the wall of the Park, in a place where I’m sure there wasn’t a wall before. Noel wasn’t anywhere about, and there was a door in the wall. And it was open; so we went through. ‘The bear has hidden himself in these mountain fastnesses,’ Oswald said. ‘I will draw my good sword and after him.’ So I drew the umbrella, which Dora always will bring in case it rains, because Noel gets a cold on the chest at the least thing, and we went on. The other side of the wall it was a stable yard, all cobble-stones. There was nobody about, but we could hear a man rubbing down a horse and hissing in the stable; so we crept very quietly past, and Alice whispered,  ‘’Tis the lair of the Monster Serpent; I hear his deadly hiss! Beware! Courage and despatch!’ We went over the stones on tiptoe, and we found another wall with another door in it on the other side. We went through that too, on tiptoe. It really was an adventure. And there we were in a shrubbery, and we saw something white through the trees. Dora said it was the white bear. That is so like Dora. She always begins to take part in a play just when the rest of us are getting tired of it. I don’t mean this unkindly, because I am very fond of Dora. I cannot forget how kind she was when I had bronchitis; and ingratitude is a dreadful vice. But it is quite true. ‘It is not a bear,’ said Oswald; and we all went on, still on tiptoe, round a twisty path and on to a lawn, and there was Noel. His collar had come undone, as I said, and he had an inky mark on his face that he made just before we left the house, and he wouldn’t let Dora wash it off, and one of his bootlaces was coming down. He was standing looking at a little girl; she was the funniest little girl you ever saw. She was like a china doll, the sixpenny kind; she had a white face, and long yellow hair, done up very tight in two pigtails; her forehead was very big and lumpy, and her cheeks came high up, like little shelves under her eyes. Her eyes were small and blue. She had on a funny black frock, with curly braid on it, and button boots that went almost up to her knees. Her legs were very thin. She was sitting in a hammock chair nursing a blue kitten, not a sky-blue one, of course, but the colour of a new slate pencil. As we came up we heard her say to Noel, ‘Who are you?’ Noel had forgotten about the bear, and he was taking his favourite part, so he said, ‘I’m Prince Camaralzaman.’ The funny little girl looked pleased,  ‘I thought at first you were a common boy,’ she said. Then she saw the rest of us and said,  ‘Are you all Princesses and Princes too?’ Of course we said ‘Yes,’ and she said,  ‘I am a Princess also.’ She said it very well too, exactly as if it were true. We were very glad, because it is so seldom you meet any children who can begin to play right off without having everything explained to them. And even then they will say they are going to ‘pretend to be’ a lion, or a witch, or a king. Now this little girl just said ‘I  am  a Princess.’ Then she looked at Oswald and said, ‘I fancy I’ve seen you at Baden.’ Of course Oswald said, ‘Very likely.’ The little girl had a funny voice, and all her words were quite plain, each word by itself; she didn’t talk at all like we do. H. O. asked her what the cat’s name was, and she said ‘Katinka.’ Then Dicky said,  ‘Let’s get away from the windows; if you play near windows some one inside generally knocks at them and says “Don’t”.’ The Princess put down the cat very carefully and said,  ‘I am forbidden to walk off the grass.’ ‘That’s a pity,’ said Dora. ‘But I will if you like,’ said the Princess. ‘You mustn’t do things you are forbidden to do,’ Dora said; but Dicky showed us that there was some more grass beyond the shrubs with only a gravel path between. So I lifted the Princess over the gravel, so that she should be able to say she hadn’t walked off the grass. When we got to the other grass we all sat down, and the Princess asked us if we liked ‘dragees’ (I know that’s how you spell it, for I asked Albert-next-door’s uncle). We said we thought not, but she pulled a real silver box out of her pocket and showed us; they were just flat, round chocolates. We had two each. Then we asked her her name, and she began, and when she began she went on, and on, and on, till I thought she was never going to stop. H. O. said she had fifty names, but Dicky is very good at figures, and he says there were only eighteen. The first were Pauline, Alexandra, Alice, and Mary was one, and Victoria, for we all heard that, and it ended up with Hildegarde Cunigonde something or other, Princess of something else. When she’d done, H. O. said, ‘That’s jolly good! Say it again!’ and she did, but even then we couldn’t remember it. We told her our names, but she thought they were too short, so when it was Noel’s turn he said he was Prince Noel Camaralzaman Ivan Constantine Charlemagne James John Edward Biggs Maximilian Bastable Prince of Lewisham, but when she asked him to say it again of course he could only get the first two names right, because he’d made it up as he went on. So the Princess said, ‘You are quite old enough to know your own name.’ She was very grave and serious. She told us that she was the fifth cousin of Queen Victoria. We asked who the other cousins were, but she did not seem to understand. She went on and said she was seven times removed. She couldn’t tell us what that meant either, but Oswald thinks it means that the Queen’s cousins are so fond of her that they will keep coming bothering, so the Queen’s servants have orders to remove them. This little girl must have been very fond of the Queen to try so often to see her, and to have been seven times removed. We could see that it is considered something to be proud of; but we thought it was hard on the Queen that her cousins wouldn’t let her alone. Presently the little girl asked us where our maids and governesses were. We told her we hadn’t any just now. And she said,  ‘How pleasant! And did you come here alone?’ ‘Yes,’ said Dora; ‘we came across the Heath.’ ‘You are very fortunate,’ said the little girl. She sat very upright on the grass, with her fat little hands in her lap. ‘I should like to go on the Heath. There are donkeys there, with white saddle covers. I should like to ride them, but my governess will not permit.’ ‘I’m glad we haven’t a governess,’ H. O. said. ‘We ride the donkeys whenever we have any pennies, and once I gave the man another penny to make it gallop.’ ‘You are indeed fortunate!’ said the Princess again, and when she looked sad the shelves on her cheeks showed more than ever. You could have laid a sixpence on them quite safely if you had had one. ‘Never mind,’ said Noel; ‘I’ve got a lot of money. Come out and have a ride now.’ But the little girl shook her head and said she was afraid it would not be correct. Dora said she was quite right; then all of a sudden came one of those uncomfortable times when nobody can think of anything to say, so we sat and looked at each other. But at last Alice said we ought to be going. ‘Do not go yet,’ the little girl said. ‘At what time did they order your carriage?’ ‘Our carriage is a fairy one, drawn by griffins, and it comes when we wish for it,’ said Noel. The little girl looked at him very queerly, and said, ‘That is out of a picture-book.’ Then Noel said he thought it was about time he was married if we were to be home in time for tea. The little girl was rather stupid over it, but she did what we told her, and we married them with Dora’s pocket-handkerchief for a veil, and the ring off the back of one of the buttons on H. O.’s blouse just went on her little finger. Then we showed her how to play cross-touch, and puss in the corner, and tag. It was funny, she didn’t know any games but battledore and shuttlecock and les graces. But she really began to laugh at last and not to look quite so like a doll. She was Puss and was running after Dicky when suddenly she stopped short and looked as if she was going to cry. And we looked too, and there were two prim ladies with little mouths and tight hair. One of them said in quite an awful voice, ‘Pauline, who are these children?’ and her voice was gruff; with very curly R’s. The little girl said we were Princes and Princesses, which was silly, to a grown-up person that is not a great friend of yours. The gruff lady gave a short, horrid laugh, like a husky bark, and said,  ‘Princes, indeed! They’re only common children!’ Dora turned very red and began to speak, but the little girl cried out ‘Common children! Oh, I am so glad! When I am grown up I’ll always play with common children.’ And she ran at us, and began to kiss us one by one, beginning with Alice; she had got to H. O. when the horrid lady said, ‘Your Highness, go indoors at once!’ The little girl answered, ‘I won’t!’ Then the prim lady said, ‘Wilson, carry her Highness indoors.’ And the little girl was carried away screaming, and kicking with her little thin legs and her buttoned boots, and between her screams she shrieked: ‘Common children! I am glad, glad, glad! Common children! Common children!’ The nasty lady then remarked, ‘Go at once, or I will send for the police!’ So we went. H. O. made a face at her and so did Alice, but Oswald took off his cap and said he was sorry if she was annoyed about anything; for Oswald has always been taught to be polite to ladies, however nasty. Dicky took his off, too, when he saw me do it; he says he did it first, but that is a mistake. If I were really a common boy I should say it was a lie. Then we all came away, and when we got outside Dora said, ‘So she was really a Princess. Fancy a Princess living  there !’ ‘Even Princesses have to live somewhere,’ said Dicky. ‘And I thought it was play. And it was real. I wish I’d known! I should have liked to ask her lots of things,’ said Alice. H. O. said he would have liked to ask her what she had for dinner and whether she had a crown. I felt, myself, we had lost a chance of finding out a great deal about kings and queens. I might have known such a stupid-looking little girl would never have been able to pretend, as well as that. So we all went home across the Heath, and made dripping toast for tea. When we were eating it Noel said, ‘I wish I could give  her  some! It is very good.’ He sighed as he said it, and his mouth was very full, so we knew he was thinking of his Princess. He says now that she was as beautiful as the day, but we remember her quite well, and she was nothing of the kind. CHAPTER 7. BEING BANDITS Noel was quite tiresome for ever so long after we found the Princess. He would keep on wanting to go to the Park when the rest of us didn’t, and though we went several times to please him, we never found that door open again, and all of us except him knew from the first that it would be no go. So now we thought it was time to do something to rouse him from the stupor of despair, which is always done to heroes when anything baffling has occurred. Besides, we were getting very short of money again, the fortunes of your house cannot be restored (not so that they will last, that is), even by the one pound eight we got when we had the ‘good hunting.’ We spent a good deal of that on presents for Father’s birthday. We got him a paper-weight, like a glass bun, with a picture of Lewisham Church at the bottom; and a blotting-pad, and a box of preserved fruits, and an ivory penholder with a view of Greenwich Park in the little hole where you look through at the top. He was most awfully pleased and surprised, and when he heard how Noel and Oswald had earned the money to buy the things he was more surprised still. Nearly all the rest of our money went to get fireworks for the Fifth of November. We got six Catherine wheels and four rockets; two hand-lights, one red and one green; a sixpenny maroon; two Roman-candles, they cost a shilling; some Italian streamers, a fairy fountain, and a tourbillon that cost eighteen-pence and was very nearly worth it. But I think crackers and squibs are a mistake. It’s true you get a lot of them for the money, and they are not bad fun for the first two or three dozen, but you get jolly sick of them before you’ve let off your sixpenn’orth. And the only amusing way is not allowed: it is putting them in the fire. It always seems a long time till the evening when you have got fireworks in the house, and I think as it was a rather foggy day we should have decided to let them off directly after breakfast, only Father had said he would help us to let them off at eight o’clock after he had had his dinner, and you ought never to disappoint your father if you can help it. You see we had three good reasons for trying H. O.’s idea of restoring the fallen fortunes of our house by becoming bandits on the Fifth of November. We had a fourth reason as well, and that was the best reason of the lot. You remember Dora thought it would be wrong to be bandits. And the Fifth of November came while Dora was away at Stroud staying with her godmother. Stroud is in Gloucestershire. We were determined to do it while she was out of the way, because we did not think it wrong, and besides we meant to do it anyhow. We held a Council, of course, and laid our plans very carefully. We let H. O. be Captain, because it was his idea. Oswald was Lieutenant. Oswald was quite fair, because he let H. O. call himself Captain; but Oswald is the eldest next to Dora, after all. Our plan was this. We were all to go up on to the Heath. Our house is in the Lewisham Road, but it’s quite close to the Heath if you cut up the short way opposite the confectioner’s, past the nursery gardens and the cottage hospital, and turn to the left again and afterwards to the right. You come out then at the top of the hill, where the big guns are with the iron fence round them, and where the bands play on Thursday evenings in the summer. We were to lurk in ambush there, and waylay an unwary traveller. We were to call upon him to surrender his arms, and then bring him home and put him in the deepest dungeon below the castle moat; then we were to load him with chains and send to his friends for ransom. You may think we had no chains, but you are wrong, because we used to keep two other dogs once, besides Pincher, before the fall of the fortunes of the ancient House of Bastable. And they were quite big dogs. It was latish in the afternoon before we started. We thought we could lurk better if it was nearly dark. It was rather foggy, and we waited a good while beside the railings, but all the belated travellers were either grown up or else they were Board School children. We weren’t going to get into a row with grown-up people, especially strangers, and no true bandit would ever stoop to ask a ransom from the relations of the poor and needy. So we thought it better to wait. As I said, it was Guy Fawkes Day, and if it had not been we should never have been able to be bandits at all, for the unwary traveller we did catch had been forbidden to go out because he had a cold in his head. But he would run out to follow a guy, without even putting on a coat or a comforter, and it was a very damp, foggy afternoon and nearly dark, so you see it was his own fault entirely, and served him jolly well right. We saw him coming over the Heath just as we were deciding to go home to tea. He had followed that guy right across to the village (we call Blackheath the village; I don’t know why), and he was coming back dragging his feet and sniffing. ‘Hist, an unwary traveller approaches!’ whispered Oswald. ‘Muffle your horses’ heads and see to the priming of your pistols,’ muttered Alice. She always will play boys’ parts, and she makes Ellis cut her hair short on purpose. Ellis is a very obliging hairdresser. ‘Steal softly upon him,’ said Noel; ‘for lo! ‘tis dusk, and no human eyes can mark our deeds.’ So we ran out and surrounded the unwary traveller. It turned out to be Albert-next-door, and he was very frightened indeed until he saw who we were. ‘Surrender!’ hissed Oswald, in a desperate-sounding voice, as he caught the arm of the Unwary. And Albert-next-door said, ‘All right! I’m surrendering as hard as I can. You needn’t pull my arm off.’ We explained to him that resistance was useless, and I think he saw that from the first. We held him tight by both arms, and we marched him home down the hill in a hollow square of five. He wanted to tell us about the guy, but we made him see that it was not proper for prisoners to talk to the guard, especially about guys that the prisoner had been told not to go after because of his cold. When we got to where we live he said, ‘All right, I don’t want to tell you. You’ll wish I had afterwards. You never saw such a guy.’ ‘I can see  you !’ said H. O. It was very rude, and Oswald told him so at once, because it is his duty as an elder brother. But H. O. is very young and does not know better yet, and besides it wasn’t bad for H. O. Albert-next-door said, ‘You haven’t any manners, and I want to go in to my tea. Let go of me!’ But Alice told him, quite kindly, that he was not going in to his tea, but coming with us. ‘I’m not,’ said Albert-next-door; ‘I’m going home. Leave go! I’ve got a bad cold. You’re making it worse.’ Then he tried to cough, which was very silly, because we’d seen him in the morning, and he’d told us where the cold was that he wasn’t to go out with. When he had tried to cough, he said, ‘Leave go of me! You see my cold’s getting worse.’ ‘You should have thought of that before,’ said Dicky; ‘you’re coming in with us.’ ‘Don’t be a silly,’ said Noel; ‘you know we told you at the very beginning that resistance was useless. There is no disgrace in yielding. We are five to your one.’ By this time Eliza had opened the door, and we thought it best to take him in without any more parlaying. To parley with a prisoner is not done by bandits. Directly we got him safe into the nursery, H. O. began to jump about and say, ‘Now you’re a prisoner really and truly!’ And Albert-next-door began to cry. He always does. I wonder he didn’t begin long before, but Alice fetched him one of the dried fruits we gave Father for his birthday. It was a green walnut. I have noticed the walnuts and the plums always get left till the last in the box; the apricots go first, and then the figs and pears; and the cherries, if there are any. So he ate it and shut up. Then we explained his position to him, so that there should be no mistake, and he couldn’t say afterwards that he had not understood. ‘There will be no violence,’ said Oswald, he was now Captain of the Bandits, because we all know H. O. likes to be Chaplain when we play prisoners, ‘no violence. But you will be confined in a dark, subterranean dungeon where toads and snakes crawl, and but little of the light of day filters through the heavily mullioned windows. You will be loaded with chains. Now don’t begin again, Baby, there’s nothing to cry about; straw will be your pallet; beside you the gaoler will set a ewer, a ewer is only a jug, stupid; it won’t eat you, a ewer with water; and a mouldering crust will be your food.’ But Albert-next-door never enters into the spirit of a thing. He mumbled something about tea-time. Now Oswald, though stern, is always just, and besides we were all rather hungry, and tea was ready. So we had it at once, Albert-next-door and all, and we gave him what was left of the four-pound jar of apricot jam we got with the money Noel got for his poetry. And we saved our crusts for the prisoner. Albert-next-door was very tiresome. Nobody could have had a nicer prison than he had. We fenced him into a corner with the old wire nursery fender and all the chairs, instead of putting him in the coal-cellar as we had first intended. And when he said the dog-chains were cold the girls were kind enough to warm his fetters thoroughly at the fire before we put them on him. We got the straw cases of some bottles of wine someone sent Father one Christmas, it is some years ago, but the cases are quite good. We unpacked them very carefully and pulled them to pieces and scattered the straw about. It made a lovely straw pallet, and took ever so long to make, but Albert-next-door has yet to learn what gratitude really is. We got the bread trencher for the wooden platter where the prisoner’s crusts were put, they were not mouldy, but we could not wait till they got so, and for the ewer we got the toilet jug out of the spare-room where nobody ever sleeps. And even then Albert-next-door couldn’t be happy like the rest of us. He howled and cried and tried to get out, and he knocked the ewer over and stamped on the mouldering crusts. Luckily there was no water in the ewer because we had forgotten it, only dust and spiders. So we tied him up with the clothes-line from the back kitchen, and we had to hurry up, which was a pity for him. We might have had him rescued by a devoted page if he hadn’t been so tiresome. In fact Noel was actually dressing up for the page when Albert-next-door kicked over the prison ewer. We got a sheet of paper out of an old exercise-book, and we made H. O. prick his own thumb, because he is our little brother and it is our duty to teach him to be brave. We none of us mind pricking ourselves; we’ve done it heaps of times. H. O. didn’t like it, but he agreed to do it, and I helped him a little because he was so slow, and when he saw the red bead of blood getting fatter and bigger as I squeezed his thumb he was very pleased, just as I had told him he would be. This is what we wrote with H. O.’s blood, only the blood gave out when we got to ‘Restored’, and we had to write the rest with crimson lake, which is not the same colour, though I always use it, myself, for painting wounds. While Oswald was writing it he heard Alice whispering to the prisoner that it would soon be over, and it was only play. The prisoner left off howling, so I pretended not to hear what she said. A Bandit Captain has to overlook things sometimes. This was the letter,      ‘Albert Morrison is held a prisoner by Bandits.     On payment of three thousand pounds he will be     restored to his sorrowing relatives, and all     will be forgotten and forgiven.’ I was not sure about the last part, but Dicky was certain he had seen it in the paper, so I suppose it must have been all right. We let H. O. take the letter; it was only fair, as it was his blood it was written with, and told him to leave it next door for Mrs Morrison. H. O. came back quite quickly, and Albert-next-door’s uncle came with him. ‘What is all this, Albert?’ he cried. ‘Alas, alas, my nephew! Do I find you the prisoner of a desperate band of brigands?’ ‘Bandits,’ said H. O; ‘you know it says bandits.’ ‘I beg your pardon, gentlemen,’ said Albert-next-door’s uncle, ‘bandits it is, of course. This, Albert, is the direct result of the pursuit of the guy on an occasion when your doting mother had expressly warned you to forgo the pleasures of the chase.’ Albert said it wasn’t his fault, and he hadn’t wanted to play. ‘So ho!’ said his uncle, ‘impenitent too! Where’s the dungeon?’ We explained the dungeon, and showed him the straw pallet and the ewer and the mouldering crusts and other things. ‘Very pretty and complete,’ he said. ‘Albert, you are more highly privileged than ever I was. No one ever made me a nice dungeon when I was your age. I think I had better leave you where you are.’ Albert began to cry again and said he was sorry, and he would be a good boy. ‘And on this old familiar basis you expect me to ransom you, do you? Honestly, my nephew, I doubt whether you are worth it. Besides, the sum mentioned in this document strikes me as excessive: Albert really is  not  worth three thousand pounds. Also by a strange and unfortunate chance I haven’t the money about me. Couldn’t you take less?’ We said perhaps we could. ‘Say eightpence,’ suggested Albert-next-door’s uncle, ‘which is all the small change I happen to have on my person.’ ‘Thank you very much,’ said Alice as he held it out; ‘but are you sure you can spare it? Because really it was only play.’ ‘Quite sure. Now, Albert, the game is over. You had better run home to your mother and tell her how much you’ve enjoyed yourself.’ When Albert-next-door had gone his uncle sat in the Guy Fawkes armchair and took Alice on his knee, and we sat round the fire waiting till it would be time to let off our fireworks. We roasted the chestnuts he sent Dicky out for, and he told us stories till it was nearly seven. His stories are first-rate, he does all the parts in different voices. At last he said,  ‘Look here, young-uns. I like to see you play and enjoy yourselves, and I don’t think it hurts Albert to enjoy himself too.’ ‘I don’t think he did much,’ said H. O. But I knew what Albert-next-door’s uncle meant because I am much older than H. O. He went on,  ‘But what about Albert’s mother? Didn’t you think how anxious she would be at his not coming home? As it happens I saw him come in with you, so we knew it was all right. But if I hadn’t, eh?’ He only talks like that when he is very serious, or even angry. Other times he talks like people in books, to us, I mean. We none of us said anything. But I was thinking. Then Alice spoke. Girls seem not to mind saying things that we don’t say. She put her arms round Albert-next-door’s uncle’s neck and said,  ‘We’re very, very sorry. We didn’t think about his mother. You see we try very hard not to think about other people’s mothers because, ’ Just then we heard Father’s key in the door and Albert-next-door’s uncle kissed Alice and put her down, and we all went down to meet Father. As we went I thought I heard Albert-next-door’s uncle say something that sounded like ‘Poor little beggars!’ He couldn’t have meant us, when we’d been having such a jolly time, and chestnuts, and fireworks to look forward to after dinner and everything! CHAPTER 8. BEING EDITORS It was Albert’s uncle who thought of our trying a newspaper. He said he thought we should not find the bandit business a paying industry, as a permanency, and that journalism might be. We had sold Noel’s poetry and that piece of information about Lord Tottenham to the good editor, so we thought it would not be a bad idea to have a newspaper of our own. We saw plainly that editors must be very rich and powerful, because of the grand office and the man in the glass case, like a museum, and the soft carpets and big writing-table. Besides our having seen a whole handful of money that the editor pulled out quite carelessly from his trousers pocket when he gave me my five bob. Dora wanted to be editor and so did Oswald, but he gave way to her because she is a girl, and afterwards he knew that it is true what it says in the copy-books about Virtue being its own Reward. Because you’ve no idea what a bother it is. Everybody wanted to put in everything just as they liked, no matter how much room there was on the page. It was simply awful! Dora put up with it as long as she could and then she said if she wasn’t let alone she wouldn’t go on being editor; they could be the paper’s editors themselves, so there. Then Oswald said, like a good brother: ‘I will help you if you like, Dora,’ and she said, ‘You’re more trouble than all the rest of them! Come and be editor and see how you like it. I give it up to you.’ But she didn’t, and we did it together. We let Albert-next-door be sub-editor, because he had hurt his foot with a nail in his boot that gathered. When it was done Albert-next-door’s uncle had it copied for us in typewriting, and we sent copies to all our friends, and then of course there was no one left that we could ask to buy it. We did not think of that until too late. We called the paper the Lewisham Recorder; Lewisham because we live there, and Recorder in memory of the good editor. I could write a better paper on my head, but an editor is not allowed to write all the paper. It is very hard, but he is not. You just have to fill up with what you can get from other writers. If I ever have time I will write a paper all by myself. It won’t be patchy. We had no time to make it an illustrated paper, but I drew the ship going down with all hands for the first copy. But the typewriter can’t draw ships, so it was left out in the other copies. The time the first paper took to write out no one would believe! This was the Newspaper:           THE LEWISHAM RECORDER     EDITORS:  DORA AND OSWALD BASTABLE              , , , , , ,              EDITORIAL NOTE Every paper is written for some reason. Ours is because we want to sell it and get money. If what we have written brings happiness to any sad heart we shall not have laboured in vain. But we want the money too. Many papers are content with the sad heart and the happiness, but we are not like that, and it is best not to be deceitful. EDITORS. There will be two serial stories; One by Dicky and one by all of us. In a serial story you only put in one chapter at a time. But we shall put all our serial story at once, if Dora has time to copy it. Dicky’s will come later on.             SERIAL STORY              BY US ALL          CHAPTER I, by Dora The sun was setting behind a romantic-looking tower when two strangers might have been observed descending the crest of the hill. The eldest, a man in the prime of life; the other a handsome youth who reminded everybody of Quentin Durward. They approached the Castle, in which the fair Lady Alicia awaited her deliverers. She leaned from the castellated window and waved her lily hand as they approached. They returned her signal, and retired to seek rest and refreshment at a neighbouring hostelry.              , , , , , ,          CHAPTER II, by Alice The Princess was very uncomfortable in the tower, because her fairy godmother had told her all sorts of horrid things would happen if she didn’t catch a mouse every day, and she had caught so many mice that now there were hardly any left to catch. So she sent her carrier pigeon to ask the noble Strangers if they could send her a few mice, because she would be of age in a few days and then it wouldn’t matter. So the fairy godmother, - (I’m very sorry, but there’s no room to make the chapters any longer.-ED.)              , , , , , ,          CHAPTER III, by the Sub-Editor (I can’t, I’d much rather not, I don’t know how.)             , , , , , ,          CHAPTER IV, by Dicky I must now retrace my steps and tell you something about our hero. You must know he had been to an awfully jolly school, where they had turkey and goose every day for dinner, and never any mutton, and as many helps of pudding as a fellow cared to send up his plate for, so of course they had all grown up very strong, and before he left school he challenged the Head to have it out man to man, and he gave it him, I tell you. That was the education that made him able to fight Red Indians, and to be the stranger who might have been observed in the first chapter.              , , , , , ,          CHAPTER V, by Noel I think it’s time something happened in this story. So then the dragon he came out, blowing fire out of his nose, and he said,  ‘Come on, you valiant man and true, I’d like to have a set-to along of you!’ (That’s bad English., ED. I don’t care; it’s what the dragon said. Who told you dragons didn’t talk bad English?, Noel.) So the hero, whose name was Noeloninuris, replied,       ‘My blade is sharp, my axe is keen,      You’re not nearly as big      As a good many dragons I’ve seen.’ (Don’t put in so much poetry, Noel.

Then the Prince, whose real name didn’t begin with N, but was Osrawalddo, waved his magic sword, and the dragon stood before them, bowing gracefully. They made him promise to be good, and then they forgave him; and when the wedding breakfast came, all the bones were saved for him. And so they were married and lived happy ever after.

I hope he will not attack us with his gang.’ ‘I hope not,’ responded Annie, a gentle maiden of some sixteen summers. Just then came a knock at the door of the hut, and a gruff voice asked them to open the door. ‘It is Sam Redfern the Bushranger, father,’ said the girl. ‘The same,’ responded the voice, and the next moment the hall door was smashed in, and Sam Redfern sprang in, followed by his gang.              , , , , , ,              CHAPTER II Annie’s Father was at once overpowered, and Annie herself lay bound with cords on the drawing-room sofa. Sam Redfern set a guard round the lonely hut, and all human aid was despaired of. But you never know. Far away in the Bush a different scene was being enacted. ‘Must be Injuns,’ said a tall man to himself as he pushed his way through the brushwood. It was Jim Carlton, the celebrated detective. ‘I know them,’ he added; ‘they are Apaches.’ just then ten Indians in full war-paint appeared. Carlton raised his rifle and fired, and slinging their scalps on his arm he hastened towards the humble log hut where resided his affianced bride, Annie Ridgway, sometimes known as the Flower of the Bush.              , , , , , ,              CHAPTER III The moon was low on the horizon, and Sam Redfern was seated at a drinking bout with some of his boon companions. They had rifled the cellars of the hut, and the rich wines flowed like water in the golden goblets of Mr Ridgway. But Annie had made friends with one of the gang, a noble, good-hearted man who had joined Sam Redfern by mistake, and she had told him to go and get the police as quickly as possible. ‘Ha! ha!’ cried Redfern, ‘now I am enjoying myself!’ He little knew that his doom was near upon him. Just then Annie gave a piercing scream, and Sam Redfern got up, seizing his revolver. ‘Who are you?’ he cried, as a man entered. ‘I am Jim Carlton, the celebrated detective,’ said the new arrival. Sam Redfern’s revolver dropped from his nerveless fingers, but the next moment he had sprung upon the detective with the well-known activity of the mountain sheep, and Annie shrieked, for she had grown to love the rough Bushranger.

A quantity of excellent string is offered if you know whether there really is a law passed about not buying gunpowder under thirteen., DICKY. The price of this paper is one shilling each, and sixpence extra for the picture of the Malabar going down with all hands. If we sell one hundred copies we will write another paper.                             And so we would have done, but we never did. Albert-next-door’s uncle gave us two shillings, that was all. You can’t restore fallen fortunes with two shillings! CHAPTER 9. THE G. B. Being editors is not the best way to wealth. We all feel this now, and highwaymen are not respected any more like they used to be. I am sure we had tried our best to restore our fallen fortunes. We felt their fall very much, because we knew the Bastables had been rich once. Dora and Oswald can remember when Father was always bringing nice things home from London, and there used to be turkeys and geese and wine and cigars come by the carrier at Christmas-time, and boxes of candied fruit and French plums in ornamental boxes with silk and velvet and gilding on them. They were called prunes, but the prunes you buy at the grocer’s are quite different. But now there is seldom anything nice brought from London, and the turkey and the prune people have forgotten Father’s address. ‘How  can  we restore those beastly fallen fortunes?’ said Oswald. ‘We’ve tried digging and writing and princesses and being editors.’ ‘And being bandits,’ said H. O. ‘When did you try that?’ asked Dora quickly. ‘You know I told you it was wrong.’ ‘It wasn’t wrong the way we did it,’ said Alice, quicker still, before Oswald could say, ‘Who asked you to tell us anything about it?’ which would have been rude, and he is glad he didn’t. ‘We only caught Albert-next-door.’ ‘Oh, Albert-next-door!’ said Dora contemptuously, and I felt more comfortable; for even after I didn’t say, ‘Who asked you, and cetera,’ I was afraid Dora was going to come the good elder sister over us. She does that a jolly sight too often. Dicky looked up from the paper he was reading and said, ‘This sounds likely,’ and he read out,      ‘L100 secures partnership in lucrative business for sale of     useful patent.  L10 weekly.  No personal attendance necessary.     Jobbins, 300, Old Street Road.’ ‘I wish we could secure that partnership,’ said Oswald. He is twelve, and a very thoughtful boy for his age. Alice looked up from her painting. She was trying to paint a fairy queen’s frock with green bice, and it wouldn’t rub. There is something funny about green bice. It never will rub off; no matter how expensive your paintbox is, and even boiling water is very little use. She said, ‘Bother the bice! And, Oswald, it’s no use thinking about that. Where are we to get a hundred pounds?’ ‘Ten pounds a week is five pounds to us,’ Oswald went on, he had done the sum in his head while Alice was talking, ‘because partnership means halves. It would be A1.’ Noel sat sucking his pencil, he had been writing poetry as usual. I saw the first two lines,       I wonder why Green Bice      Is never very nice. Suddenly he said, ‘I wish a fairy would come down the chimney and drop a jewel on the table, a jewel worth just a hundred pounds.’ ‘She might as well give you the hundred pounds while she was about it,’ said Dora. ‘Or while she was about it she might as well give us five pounds a week,’ said Alice. ‘Or fifty,’ said I. ‘Or five hundred,’ said Dicky. I saw H. O. open his mouth, and I knew he was going to say, ‘Or five thousand,’ so I said,  ‘Well, she won’t give us fivepence, but if you’d only do as I am always saying, and rescue a wealthy old gentleman from deadly peril he would give us a pot of money, and we could have the partnership and five pounds a week. Five pounds a week would buy a great many things.’ Then Dicky said, ‘Why shouldn’t we borrow it?’ So we said, ‘Who from?’ and then he read this out of the paper,       MONEY PRIVATELY WITHOUT FEES      THE BOND STREET BANK      Manager, Z. Rosenbaum.      Advances cash from L20 to L10,000 on ladies’ or gentlemen’s      note of hand alone, without security.  No fees.  No inquiries.      Absolute privacy guaranteed. ‘What does it all mean?’ asked H. O. ‘It means that there is a kind gentleman who has a lot of money, and he doesn’t know enough poor people to help, so he puts it in the paper that he will help them, by lending them his money, that’s it, isn’t it, Dicky?’ Dora explained this and Dicky said, ‘Yes.’ And H. O. said he was a Generous Benefactor, like in Miss Edgeworth. Then Noel wanted to know what a note of hand was, and Dicky knew that, because he had read it in a book, and it was just a letter saying you will pay the money when you can, and signed with your name. ‘No inquiries!’ said Alice. ‘Oh, Dicky, do you think he would?’ ‘Yes, I think so,’ said Dicky. ‘I wonder Father doesn’t go to this kind gentleman. I’ve seen his name before on a circular in Father’s study.’ ‘Perhaps he has.’ said Dora. But the rest of us were sure he hadn’t, because, of course, if he had, there would have been more money to buy nice things. Just then Pincher jumped up and knocked over the painting-water. He is a very careless dog. I wonder why painting-water is always such an ugly colour? Dora ran for a duster to wipe it up, and H. O. dropped drops of the water on his hands and said he had got the plague. So we played at the plague for a bit, and I was an Arab physician with a bath-towel turban, and cured the plague with magic acid-drops. After that it was time for dinner, and after dinner we talked it all over and settled that we would go and see the Generous Benefactor the very next day. But we thought perhaps the G. B., it is short for Generous Benefactor, would not like it if there were so many of us. I have often noticed that it is the worst of our being six, people think six a great many, when it’s children. That sentence looks wrong somehow. I mean they don’t mind six pairs of boots, or six pounds of apples, or six oranges, especially in equations, but they seem to think you ought not to have five brothers and sisters. Of course Dicky was to go, because it was his idea. Dora had to go to Blackheath to see an old lady, a friend of Father’s, so she couldn’t go. Alice said  she  ought to go, because it said, ‘Ladies  and  gentlemen,’ and perhaps the G. B. wouldn’t let us have the money unless there were both kinds of us. H. O. said Alice wasn’t a lady; and she said  he  wasn’t going, anyway. Then he called her a disagreeable cat, and she began to cry. But Oswald always tries to make up quarrels, so he said,  ‘You’re little sillies, both of you!’ And Dora said, ‘Don’t cry, Alice; he only meant you weren’t a grown-up lady.’ Then H. O. said, ‘What else did you think I meant, Disagreeable?’ So Dicky said, ‘Don’t be disagreeable yourself, H. O. Let her alone and say you’re sorry, or I’ll jolly well make you!’ So H. O. said he was sorry. Then Alice kissed him and said she was sorry too; and after that H. O. gave her a hug, and said, ‘Now I’m  really and truly  sorry,’ So it was all right. Noel went the last time any of us went to London, so he was out of it, and Dora said she would take him to Blackheath if we’d take H. O. So as there’d been a little disagreeableness we thought it was better to take him, and we did. At first we thought we’d tear our oldest things a bit more, and put some patches of different colours on them, to show the G. B. how much we wanted money. But Dora said that would be a sort of cheating, pretending we were poorer than we are. And Dora is right sometimes, though she is our elder sister. Then we thought we’d better wear our best things, so that the G. B. might see we weren’t so very poor that he couldn’t trust us to pay his money back when we had it. But Dora said that would be wrong too. So it came to our being quite honest, as Dora said, and going just as we were, without even washing our faces and hands; but when I looked at H. O. in the train I wished we had not been quite so particularly honest. Every one who reads this knows what it is like to go in the train, so I shall not tell about it, though it was rather fun, especially the part where the guard came for the tickets at Waterloo, and H. O. was under the seat and pretended to be a dog without a ticket. We went to Charing Cross, and we just went round to Whitehall to see the soldiers and then by St James’s for the same reason, and when we’d looked in the shops a bit we got to Brook Street, Bond Street. It was a brass plate on a door next to a shop, a very grand place, where they sold bonnets and hats, all very bright and smart, and no tickets on them to tell you the price. We rang a bell and a boy opened the door and we asked for Mr Rosenbaum. The boy was not polite; he did not ask us in. So then Dicky gave him his visiting card; it was one of Father’s really, but the name is the same, Mr Richard Bastable, and we others wrote our names underneath. I happened to have a piece of pink chalk in my pocket and we wrote them with that. Then the boy shut the door in our faces and we waited on the step. But presently he came down and asked our business. So Dicky said,  ‘Money advanced, young shaver! and don’t be all day about it!’ And then he made us wait again, till I was quite stiff in my legs, but Alice liked it because of looking at the hats and bonnets, and at last the door opened, and the boy said,  ‘Mr Rosenbaum will see you,’ so we wiped our feet on the mat, which said so, and we went up stairs with soft carpets and into a room. It was a beautiful room. I wished then we had put on our best things, or at least washed a little. But it was too late now. The room had velvet curtains and a soft, soft carpet, and it was full of the most splendid things. Black and gold cabinets, and china, and statues, and pictures. There was a picture of a cabbage and a pheasant and a dead hare that was just like life, and I would have given worlds to have it for my own. The fur was so natural I should never have been tired of looking at it; but Alice liked the one of the girl with the broken jug best. Then besides the pictures there were clocks and candlesticks and vases, and gilt looking-glasses, and boxes of cigars and scent and things littered all over the chairs and tables. It was a wonderful place, and in the middle of all the splendour was a little old gentleman with a very long black coat and a very long white beard and a hookey nose, like a falcon. And he put on a pair of gold spectacles and looked at us as if he knew exactly how much our clothes were worth. And then, while we elder ones were thinking how to begin, for we had all said ‘Good morning’ as we came in, of course, H. O. began before we could stop him. He said: ‘Are you the G. B.?’ ‘The  what ?’ said the little old gentleman. ‘The G. B.,’ said H. O., and I winked at him to shut up, but he didn’t see me, and the G. B. did. He waved his hand at  me  to shut up, so I had to, and H. O. went on, ‘It stands for Generous Benefactor.’ The old gentleman frowned. Then he said, ‘Your Father sent you here, I suppose?’ ‘No he didn’t,’ said Dicky. ‘Why did you think so?’ The old gentleman held out the card, and I explained that we took that because Father’s name happens to be the same as Dicky’s. ‘Doesn’t he know you’ve come?’ ‘No,’ said Alice, ‘we shan’t tell him till we’ve got the partnership, because his own business worries him a good deal and we don’t want to bother him with ours till it’s settled, and then we shall give him half our share.’ The old gentleman took off his spectacles and rumpled his hair with his hands, then he said, ‘Then what  did  you come for?’ ‘We saw your advertisement,’ Dicky said, ‘and we want a hundred pounds on our note of hand, and my sister came so that there should be both kinds of us; and we want it to buy a partnership with in the lucrative business for sale of useful patent. No personal attendance necessary.’ ‘I don’t think I quite follow you,’ said the G. B. ‘But one thing I should like settled before entering more fully into the matter: why did you call me Generous Benefactor?’ ‘Well, you see,’ said Alice, smiling at him to show she wasn’t frightened, though I know really she was, awfully, ‘we thought it was so  very  kind of you to try to find out the poor people who want money and to help them and lend them your money.’ ‘Hum!’ said the G. B. ‘Sit down.’ He cleared the clocks and vases and candlesticks off some of the chairs, and we sat down. The chairs were velvety, with gilt legs. It was like a king’s palace. ‘Now,’ he said, ‘you ought to be at school, instead of thinking about money. Why aren’t you?’ We told him that we should go to school again when Father could manage it, but meantime we wanted to do something to restore the fallen fortunes of the House of Bastable. And we said we thought the lucrative patent would be a very good thing. He asked a lot of questions, and we told him everything we didn’t think Father would mind our telling, and at last he said,  ‘You wish to borrow money. When will you repay it?’ ‘As soon as we’ve got it, of course,’ Dicky said. Then the G. B. said to Oswald, ‘You seem the eldest,’ but I explained to him that it was Dicky’s idea, so my being eldest didn’t matter. Then he said to Dicky, ‘You are a minor, I presume?’ Dicky said he wasn’t yet, but he had thought of being a mining engineer some day, and going to Klondike. ‘Minor, not miner,’ said the G. B. ‘I mean you’re not of age?’ ‘I shall be in ten years, though,’ said Dicky. ‘Then you might repudiate the loan,’ said the G. B., and Dicky said ‘What?’ Of course he ought to have said ‘I beg your pardon. I didn’t quite catch what you said’, that is what Oswald would have said. It is more polite than ‘What.’ ‘Repudiate the loan,’ the G. B repeated. ‘I mean you might say you would not pay me back the money, and the law could not compel you to do so.’ ‘Oh, well, if you think we’re such sneaks,’ said Dicky, and he got up off his chair. But the G. B. said, ‘Sit down, sit down; I was only joking.’ Then he talked some more, and at last he said, ‘I don’t advise you to enter into that partnership. It’s a swindle. Many advertisements are. And I have not a hundred pounds by me to-day to lend you. But I will lend you a pound, and you can spend it as you like. And when you are twenty-one you shall pay me back.’ ‘I shall pay you back long before that,’ said Dicky. ‘Thanks, awfully! And what about the note of hand?’ ‘Oh,’ said the G. B., ‘I’ll trust to your honour. Between gentlemen, you know, and ladies’, he made a beautiful bow to Alice, ‘a word is as good as a bond.’ Then he took out a sovereign, and held it in his hand while he talked to us. He gave us a lot of good advice about not going into business too young, and about doing our lessons, just swatting a bit, on our own hook, so as not to be put in a low form when we went back to school. And all the time he was stroking the sovereign and looking at it as if he thought it very beautiful. And so it was, for it was a new one. Then at last he held it out to Dicky, and when Dicky put out his hand for it the G. B. suddenly put the sovereign back in his pocket. ‘No,’ he said, ‘I won’t give you the sovereign. I’ll give you fifteen shillings, and this nice bottle of scent. It’s worth far more than the five shillings I’m charging you for it. And, when you can, you shall pay me back the pound, and sixty per cent interest, sixty per cent, sixty per cent.’ ‘What’s that?’ said H. O. The G. B. said he’d tell us that when we paid back the sovereign, but sixty per cent was nothing to be afraid of. He gave Dicky the money. And the boy was made to call a cab, and the G. B. put us in and shook hands with us all, and asked Alice to give him a kiss, so she did, and H. O. would do it too, though his face was dirtier than ever. The G. B. paid the cabman and told him what station to go to, and so we went home. That evening Father had a letter by the seven-o’clock post. And when he had read it he came up into the nursery. He did not look quite so unhappy as usual, but he looked grave. ‘You’ve been to Mr Rosenbaum’s,’ he said. So we told him all about it. It took a long time, and Father sat in the armchair. It was jolly. He doesn’t often come and talk to us now. He has to spend all his time thinking about his business. And when we’d told him all about it he said,  ‘You haven’t done any harm this time, children; rather good than harm, indeed. Mr Rosenbaum has written me a very kind letter.’ ‘Is he a friend of yours, Father?’ Oswald asked. ‘He is an acquaintance,’ said my father, frowning a little, ‘we have done some business together. And this letter, ’ he stopped and then said: ‘No; you didn’t do any harm to-day; but I want you for the future not to do anything so serious as to try to buy a partnership without consulting me, that’s all. I don’t want to interfere with your plays and pleasures; but you will consult me about business matters, won’t you?’ Of course we said we should be delighted, but then Alice, who was sitting on his knee, said, ‘We didn’t like to bother you.’ Father said, ‘I haven’t much time to be with you, for my business takes most of my time. It is an anxious business, but I can’t bear to think of your being left all alone like this.’ He looked so sad we all said we liked being alone. And then he looked sadder than ever. Then Alice said, ‘We don’t mean that exactly, Father. It is rather lonely sometimes, since Mother died.’ Then we were all quiet a little while. Father stayed with us till we went to bed, and when he said good night he looked quite cheerful. So we told him so, and he said,  ‘Well, the fact is, that letter took a weight off my mind.’ I can’t think what he meant, but I am sure the G. B. would be pleased if he could know he had taken a weight off somebody’s mind. He is that sort of man, I think. We gave the scent to Dora. It is not quite such good scent as we thought it would be, but we had fifteen shillings, and they were all good, so is the G. B. And until those fifteen shillings were spent we felt almost as jolly as though our fortunes had been properly restored. You do not notice your general fortune so much, as long as you have money in your pocket. This is why so many children with regular pocket-money have never felt it their duty to seek for treasure. So, perhaps, our not having pocket-money was a blessing in disguise. But the disguise was quite impenetrable, like the villains’ in the books; and it seemed still more so when the fifteen shillings were all spent. Then at last the others agreed to let Oswald try his way of seeking for treasure, but they were not at all keen about it, and many a boy less firm than Oswald would have chucked the whole thing. But Oswald knew that a hero must rely on himself alone. So he stuck to it, and presently the others saw their duty, and backed him up. CHAPTER 10. LORD TOTTENHAM Oswald is a boy of firm and unswerving character, and he had never wavered from his first idea. He felt quite certain that the books were right, and that the best way to restore fallen fortunes was to rescue an old gentleman in distress. Then he brings you up as his own son: but if you preferred to go on being your own father’s son I expect the old gentleman would make it up to you some other way. In the books the least thing does it, you put up the railway carriage window, or you pick up his purse when he drops it, or you say a hymn when he suddenly asks you to, and then your fortune is made. The others, as I said, were very slack about it, and did not seem to care much about trying the rescue. They said there wasn’t any deadly peril, and we should have to make one before we could rescue the old gentleman from it, but Oswald didn’t see that that mattered. However, he thought he would try some of the easier ways first, by himself. So he waited about the station, pulling up railway carriage windows for old gentlemen who looked likely, but nothing happened, and at last the porters said he was a nuisance. So that was no go. No one ever asked him to say a hymn, though he had learned a nice short one, beginning ‘New every morning’, and when an old gentleman did drop a two-shilling piece just by Ellis’s the hairdresser’s, and Oswald picked it up, and was just thinking what he should say when he returned it, the old gentleman caught him by the collar and called him a young thief. It would have been very unpleasant for Oswald if he hadn’t happened to be a very brave boy, and knew the policeman on that beat very well indeed. So the policeman backed him up, and the old gentleman said he was sorry, and offered Oswald sixpence. Oswald refused it with polite disdain, and nothing more happened at all. When Oswald had tried by himself and it had not come off, he said to the others, ‘We’re wasting our time, not trying to rescue the old gentleman in deadly peril. Come, buck up! Do let’s do something!’ It was dinner-time, and Pincher was going round getting the bits off the plates. There were plenty because it was cold-mutton day. And Alice said,  ‘It’s only fair to try Oswald’s way, he has tried all the things the others thought of. Why couldn’t we rescue Lord Tottenham?’ Lord Tottenham is the old gentleman who walks over the Heath every day in a paper collar at three o’clock, and when he gets halfway, if there is no one about, he changes his collar and throws the dirty one into the furze-bushes. Dicky said, ‘Lord Tottenham’s all right, but where’s the deadly peril?’ And we couldn’t think of any. There are no highwaymen on Blackheath now, I am sorry to say. And though Oswald said half of us could be highwaymen and the other half rescue party, Dora kept on saying it would be wrong to be a highwayman, and so we had to give that up. Then Alice said, ‘What about Pincher?’ And we all saw at once that it could be done. Pincher is very well bred, and he does know one or two things, though we never could teach him to beg. But if you tell him to hold on, he will do it, even if you only say ‘Seize him!’ in a whisper. So we arranged it all. Dora said she wouldn’t play; she said she thought it was wrong, and she knew it was silly, so we left her out, and she went and sat in the dining-room with a goody-book, so as to be able to say she didn’t have anything to do with it, if we got into a row over it. Alice and H. O. were to hide in the furze-bushes just by where Lord Tottenham changes his collar, and they were to whisper, ‘Seize him!’ to Pincher; and then when Pincher had seized Lord Tottenham we were to go and rescue him from his deadly peril. And he would say, ‘How can I reward you, my noble young preservers?’ and it would be all right. So we went up to the Heath. We were afraid of being late. Oswald told the others what Procrastination was, so they got to the furze-bushes a little after two o’clock, and it was rather cold. Alice and H. O. and Pincher hid, but Pincher did not like it any more than they did, and as we three walked up and down we heard him whining. And Alice kept saying, ‘I  am  so cold! Isn’t he coming yet?’ And H. O. wanted to come out and jump about to warm himself. But we told him he must learn to be a Spartan boy, and that he ought to be very thankful he hadn’t got a beastly fox eating his inside all the time. H. O. is our little brother, and we are not going to let it be our fault if he grows up a milksop. Besides, it was not really cold. It was his knees, he wears socks. So they stayed where they were. And at last, when even the other three who were walking about were beginning to feel rather chilly, we saw Lord Tottenham’s big black cloak coming along, flapping in the wind like a great bird. So we said to Alice,  ‘Hist! he approaches. You’ll know when to set Pincher on by hearing Lord Tottenham talking to himself, he always does while he is taking off his collar.’ Then we three walked slowly away whistling to show we were not thinking of anything. Our lips were rather cold, but we managed to do it. Lord Tottenham came striding along, talking to himself. People call him the mad Protectionist. I don’t know what it means, but I don’t think people ought to call a Lord such names. As he passed us he said, ‘Ruin of the country, sir! Fatal error, fatal error!’ And then we looked back and saw he was getting quite near where Pincher was, and Alice and H. O. We walked on, so that he shouldn’t think we were looking, and in a minute we heard Pincher’s bark, and then nothing for a bit; and then we looked round, and sure enough good old Pincher had got Lord Tottenham by the trouser leg and was holding on like billy-ho, so we started to run. Lord Tottenham had got his collar half off, it was sticking out sideways under his ear, and he was shouting, ‘Help, help, murder!’ exactly as if some one had explained to him beforehand what he was to do. Pincher was growling and snarling and holding on. When we got to him I stopped and said,  ‘Dicky, we must rescue this good old man.’ Lord Tottenham roared in his fury, ‘Good old man be, ’ something or othered. ‘Call the dog off.’ So Oswald said, ‘It is a dangerous task, but who would hesitate to do an act of true bravery?’ And all the while Pincher was worrying and snarling, and Lord Tottenham shouting to us to get the dog away. He was dancing about in the road with Pincher hanging on like grim death; and his collar flapping about, where it was undone. Then Noel said, ‘Haste, ere yet it be too late.’ So I said to Lord Tottenham,  ‘Stand still, aged sir, and I will endeavour to alleviate your distress.’ He stood still, and I stooped down and caught hold of Pincher and whispered, ‘Drop it, sir; drop it!’ So then Pincher dropped it, and Lord Tottenham fastened his collar again, he never does change it if there’s any one looking, and he said,  ‘I’m much obliged, I’m sure. Nasty vicious brute! Here’s something to drink my health.’ But Dicky explained that we are teetotallers, and do not drink people’s healths. So Lord Tottenham said, ‘Well, I’m much obliged any way. And now I come to look at you, of course, you’re not young ruffians, but gentlemen’s sons, eh? Still, you won’t be above taking a tip from an old boy, I wasn’t when I was your age,’ and he pulled out half a sovereign. It was very silly; but now we’d done it I felt it would be beastly mean to take the old boy’s chink after putting him in such a funk. He didn’t say anything about bringing us up as his own sons, so I didn’t know what to do. I let Pincher go, and was just going to say he was very welcome, and we’d rather not have the money, which seemed the best way out of it, when that beastly dog spoiled the whole show. Directly I let him go he began to jump about at us and bark for joy, and try to lick our faces. He was so proud of what he’d done. Lord Tottenham opened his eyes and he just said, ‘The dog seems to know you.’ And then Oswald saw it was all up, and he said, ‘Good morning,’ and tried to get away. But Lord Tottenham said,  ‘Not so fast!’ And he caught Noel by the collar. Noel gave a howl, and Alice ran out from the bushes. Noel is her favourite. I’m sure I don’t know why. Lord Tottenham looked at her, and he said,  ‘So there are more of you!’ And then H. O. came out. ‘Do you complete the party?’ Lord Tottenham asked him. And H. O. said there were only five of us this time. Lord Tottenham turned sharp off and began to walk away, holding Noel by the collar. We caught up with him, and asked him where he was going, and he said, ‘To the Police Station.’ So then I said quite politely, ‘Well, don’t take Noel; he’s not strong, and he easily gets upset. Besides, it wasn’t his doing. If you want to take any one take me, it was my very own idea.’ Dicky behaved very well. He said, ‘If you take Oswald I’ll go too, but don’t take Noel; he’s such a delicate little chap.’ Lord Tottenham stopped, and he said, ‘You should have thought of that before.’ Noel was howling all the time, and his face was very white, and Alice said,  ‘Oh, do let Noel go, dear, good, kind Lord Tottenham; he’ll faint if you don’t, I know he will, he does sometimes. Oh, I wish we’d never done it! Dora said it was wrong.’ ‘Dora displayed considerable common sense,’ said Lord Tottenham, and he let Noel go. And Alice put her arm round Noel and tried to cheer him up, but he was all trembly, and as white as paper. Then Lord Tottenham said,  ‘Will you give me your word of honour not to try to escape?’ So we said we would. ‘Then follow me,’ he said, and led the way to a bench. We all followed, and Pincher too, with his tail between his legs, he knew something was wrong. Then Lord Tottenham sat down, and he made Oswald and Dicky and H. O. stand in front of him, but he let Alice and Noel sit down. And he said,  ‘You set your dog on me, and you tried to make me believe you were saving me from it. And you would have taken my half-sovereign. Such conduct is most, No, you shall tell me what it is, sir, and speak the truth.’ So I had to say it was most ungentlemanly, but I said I hadn’t been going to take the half-sovereign. ‘Then what did you do it for?’ he asked. ‘The truth, mind.’ So I said, ‘I see now it was very silly, and Dora said it was wrong, but it didn’t seem so till we did it. We wanted to restore the fallen fortunes of our house, and in the books if you rescue an old gentleman from deadly peril, he brings you up as his own son, or if you prefer to be your father’s son, he starts you in business, so that you end in wealthy affluence; and there wasn’t any deadly peril, so we made Pincher into one, and so, ’ I was so ashamed I couldn’t go on, for it did seem an awfully mean thing. Lord Tottenham said,  ‘A very nice way to make your fortune, by deceit and trickery. I have a horror of dogs. If I’d been a weak man the shock might have killed me. What do you think of yourselves, eh?’ We were all crying except Oswald, and the others say he was; and Lord Tottenham went on, ‘Well, well, I see you’re sorry. Let this be a lesson to you; and we’ll say no more about it. I’m an old man now, but I was young once.’ Then Alice slid along the bench close to him, and put her hand on his arm: her fingers were pink through the holes in her woolly gloves, and said, ‘I think you’re very good to forgive us, and we are really very, very sorry. But we wanted to be like the children in the books, only we never have the chances they have. Everything they do turns out all right. But we  are  sorry, very, very. And I know Oswald wasn’t going to take the half-sovereign. Directly you said that about a tip from an old boy I began to feel bad inside, and I whispered to H. O. that I wished we hadn’t.’ Then Lord Tottenham stood up, and he looked like the Death of Nelson, for he is clean shaved and it is a good face, and he said,  ‘Always remember never to do a dishonourable thing, for money or for anything else in the world.’ And we promised we would remember. Then he took off his hat, and we took off ours, and he went away, and we went home. I never felt so cheap in all my life! Dora said, ‘I told you so,’ but we didn’t mind even that so much, though it was indeed hard to bear. It was what Lord Tottenham had said about ungentlemanly. We didn’t go on to the Heath for a week after that; but at last we all went, and we waited for him by the bench. When he came along Alice said, ‘Please, Lord Tottenham, we have not been on the Heath for a week, to be a punishment because you let us off. And we have brought you a present each if you will take them to show you are willing to make it up.’ He sat down on the bench, and we gave him our presents. Oswald gave him a sixpenny compass, he bought it with my own money on purpose to give him. Oswald always buys useful presents. The needle would not move after I’d had it a day or two, but Lord Tottenham used to be an admiral, so he will be able to make that go all right. Alice had made him a shaving-case, with a rose worked on it. And H. O. gave him his knife, the same one he once cut all the buttons off his best suit with. Dicky gave him his prize, Naval Heroes, because it was the best thing he had, and Noel gave him a piece of poetry he had made himself,      When sin and shame bow down the brow     Then people feel just like we do now.     We are so sorry with grief and pain     We never will be so ungentlemanly again. Lord Tottenham seemed very pleased. He thanked us, and talked to us for a bit, and when he said good-bye he said,  ‘All’s fair weather now, mates,’ and shook hands. And whenever we meet him he nods to us, and if the girls are with us he takes off his hat, so he can’t really be going on thinking us ungentlemanly now. CHAPTER 11. CASTILIAN AMOROSO One day when we suddenly found that we had half a crown we decided that we really ought to try Dicky’s way of restoring our fallen fortunes while yet the deed was in our power. Because it might easily have happened to us never to have half a crown again. So we decided to dally no longer with being journalists and bandits and things like them, but to send for sample and instructions how to earn two pounds a week each in our spare time. We had seen the advertisement in the paper, and we had always wanted to do it, but we had never had the money to spare before, somehow. The advertisement says: ‘Any lady or gentleman can easily earn two pounds a week in their spare time. Sample and instructions, two shillings. Packed free from observation.’ A good deal of the half-crown was Dora’s. It came from her godmother; but she said she would not mind letting Dicky have it if he would pay her back before Christmas, and if we were sure it was right to try to make our fortune that way. Of course that was quite easy, because out of two pounds a week in your spare time you can easily pay all your debts, and have almost as much left as you began with; and as to the right we told her to dry up. Dicky had always thought that this was really the best way to restore our fallen fortunes, and we were glad that now he had a chance of trying because of course we wanted the two pounds a week each, and besides, we were rather tired of Dicky’s always saying, when our ways didn’t turn out well, ‘Why don’t you try the sample and instructions about our spare time?’ When we found out about our half-crown we got the paper. Noel was playing admirals in it, but he had made the cocked hat without tearing the paper, and we found the advertisement, and it said just the same as ever. So we got a two-shilling postal order and a stamp, and what was left of the money it was agreed we would spend in ginger-beer to drink success to trade. We got some nice paper out of Father’s study, and Dicky wrote the letter, and we put in the money and put on the stamp, and made H. O. post it. Then we drank the ginger-beer, and then we waited for the sample and instructions. It seemed a long time coming, and the postman got quite tired of us running out and stopping him in the street to ask if it had come. But on the third morning it came. It was quite a large parcel, and it was packed, as the advertisement said it would be, ‘free from observation.’ That means it was in a box; and inside the box was some stiff browny cardboard, crinkled like the galvanized iron on the tops of chicken-houses, and inside that was a lot of paper, some of it printed and some scrappy, and in the very middle of it all a bottle, not very large, and black, and sealed on the top of the cork with yellow sealing-wax. We looked at it as it lay on the nursery table, and while all the others grabbed at the papers to see what the printing said, Oswald went to look for the corkscrew, so as to see what was inside the bottle. He found the corkscrew in the dresser drawer, it always gets there, though it is supposed to be in the sideboard drawer in the dining-room, and when he got back the others had read most of the printed papers. ‘I don’t think it’s much good, and I don’t think it’s quite nice to sell wine,’ Dora said ‘and besides, it’s not easy to suddenly begin to sell things when you aren’t used to it.’ ‘I don’t know,’ said Alice; ‘I believe I could.’ They all looked rather down in the mouth, though, and Oswald asked how you were to make your two pounds a week. ‘Why, you’ve got to get people to taste that stuff in the bottle. It’s sherry, Castilian Amoroso its name is, and then you get them to buy it, and then you write to the people and tell them the other people want the wine, and then for every dozen you sell you get two shillings from the wine people, so if you sell twenty dozen a week you get your two pounds. I don’t think we shall sell as much as that,’ said Dicky. ‘We might not the first week,’ Alice said, ‘but when people found out how nice it was, they would want more and more. And if we only got ten shillings a week it would be something to begin with, wouldn’t it?’ Oswald said he should jolly well think it would, and then Dicky took the cork out with the corkscrew. The cork broke a good deal, and some of the bits went into the bottle. Dora got the medicine glass that has the teaspoons and tablespoons marked on it, and we agreed to have a teaspoonful each, to see what it was like. ‘No one must have more than that,’ Dora said, ‘however nice it is.’ Dora behaved rather as if it were her bottle. I suppose it was, because she had lent the money for it. Then she measured out the teaspoonful, and she had first go, because of being the eldest. We asked at once what it was like, but Dora could not speak just then. Then she said, ‘It’s like the tonic Noel had in the spring; but perhaps sherry ought to be like that.’ Then it was Oswald’s turn. He thought it was very burny; but he said nothing. He wanted to see first what the others would say. Dicky said his was simply beastly, and Alice said Noel could taste next if he liked. Noel said it was the golden wine of the gods, but he had to put his handkerchief up to his mouth all the same, and I saw the face he made. Then H. O. had his, and he spat it out in the fire, which was very rude and nasty, and we told him so. Then it was Alice’s turn. She said, ‘Only half a teaspoonful for me, Dora. We mustn’t use it all up.’ And she tasted it and said nothing. Then Dicky said: ‘Look here, I chuck this. I’m not going to hawk round such beastly stuff. Any one who likes can have the bottle. Quis?’ And Alice got out ‘Ego’ before the rest of us. Then she said, ‘I know what’s the matter with it. It wants sugar.’ And at once we all saw that that was all there was the matter with the stuff. So we got two lumps of sugar and crushed it on the floor with one of the big wooden bricks till it was powdery, and mixed it with some of the wine up to the tablespoon mark, and it was quite different, and not nearly so nasty. ‘You see it’s all right when you get used to it,’ Dicky said. I think he was sorry he had said ‘Quis?’ in such a hurry. ‘Of course,’ Alice said, ‘it’s rather dusty. We must crush the sugar carefully in clean paper before we put it in the bottle.’ Dora said she was afraid it would be cheating to make one bottle nicer than what people would get when they ordered a dozen bottles, but Alice said Dora always made a fuss about everything, and really it would be quite honest. ‘You see,’ she said, ‘I shall just tell them, quite truthfully, what we have done to it, and when their dozens come they can do it for themselves.’ So then we crushed eight more lumps, very cleanly and carefully between newspapers, and shook it up well in the bottle, and corked it up with a screw of paper, brown and not news, for fear of the poisonous printing ink getting wet and dripping down into the wine and killing people. We made Pincher have a taste, and he sneezed for ever so long, and after that he used to go under the sofa whenever we showed him the bottle. Then we asked Alice who she would try and sell it to. She said: ‘I shall ask everybody who comes to the house. And while we are doing that, we can be thinking of outside people to take it to. We must be careful: there’s not much more than half of it left, even counting the sugar.’ We did not wish to tell Eliza, I don’t know why. And she opened the door very quickly that day, so that the Taxes and a man who came to our house by mistake for next door got away before Alice had a chance to try them with the Castilian Amoroso. But about five Eliza slipped out for half an hour to see a friend who was making her a hat for Sunday, and while she was gone there was a knock. Alice went, and we looked over the banisters. When she opened the door, she said at once, ‘Will you walk in, please?’ The person at the door said, ‘I called to see your Pa, miss. Is he at home?’ Alice said again, ‘Will you walk in, please?’ Then the person, it sounded like a man, said, ‘He is in, then?’ But Alice only kept on saying, ‘Will you walk in, please?’ so at last the man did, rubbing his boots very loudly on the mat. Then Alice shut the front door, and we saw that it was the butcher, with an envelope in his hand. He was not dressed in blue, like when he is cutting up the sheep and things in the shop, and he wore knickerbockers. Alice says he came on a bicycle. She led the way into the dining-room, where the Castilian Amoroso bottle and the medicine glass were standing on the table all ready. The others stayed on the stairs, but Oswald crept down and looked through the door-crack. ‘Please sit down,’ said Alice quite calmly, though she told me afterwards I had no idea how silly she felt. And the butcher sat down. Then Alice stood quite still and said nothing, but she fiddled with the medicine glass and put the screw of brown paper straight in the Castilian bottle. ‘Will you tell your Pa I’d like a word with him?’ the butcher said, when he got tired of saying nothing. ‘He’ll be in very soon, I think,’ Alice said. And then she stood still again and said nothing. It was beginning to look very idiotic of her, and H. O. laughed. I went back and cuffed him for it quite quietly, and I don’t think the butcher heard. But Alice did, and it roused her from her stupor. She spoke suddenly, very fast indeed, so fast that I knew she had made up what she was going to say before. She had got most of it out of the circular. She said, ‘I want to call your attention to a sample of sherry wine I have here. It is called Castilian something or other, and at the price it is unequalled for flavour and bouquet.’ The butcher said, ‘Well, I never!’ And Alice went on, ‘Would you like to taste it?’ ‘Thank you very much, I’m sure, miss,’ said the butcher. Alice poured some out. The butcher tasted a very little. He licked his lips, and we thought he was going to say how good it was. But he did not. He put down the medicine glass with nearly all the stuff left in it (we put it back in the bottle afterwards to save waste) and said, ‘Excuse me, miss, but isn’t it a little sweet?, for sherry I mean?’ ‘The  Real  isn’t,’ said Alice. ‘If you order a dozen it will come quite different to that, we like it best with sugar. I wish you  would  order some.’ The butcher asked why. Alice did not speak for a minute, and then she said,  ‘I don’t mind telling  you : you are in business yourself, aren’t you? We are trying to get people to buy it, because we shall have two shillings for every dozen we can make any one buy. It’s called a purr something.’ ‘A percentage. Yes, I see,’ said the butcher, looking at the hole in the carpet. ‘You see there are reasons,’ Alice went on, ‘why we want to make our fortunes as quickly as we can.’ ‘Quite so,’ said the butcher, and he looked at the place where the paper is coming off the wall. ‘And this seems a good way,’ Alice went on. ‘We paid two shillings for the sample and instructions, and it says you can make two pounds a week easily in your leisure time.’ ‘I’m sure I hope you may, miss,’ said the butcher. And Alice said again would he buy some? ‘Sherry is my favourite wine,’ he said. Alice asked him to have some more to drink. ‘No, thank you, miss,’ he said; ‘it’s my favourite wine, but it doesn’t agree with me; not the least bit. But I’ve an uncle drinks it. Suppose I ordered him half a dozen for a Christmas present? Well, miss, here’s the shilling commission, anyway,’ and he pulled out a handful of money and gave her the shilling. ‘But I thought the wine people paid that,’ Alice said. But the butcher said not on half-dozens they didn’t. Then he said he didn’t think he’d wait any longer for Father, but would Alice ask Father to write him? Alice offered him the sherry again, but he said something about ‘Not for worlds!’, and then she let him out and came back to us with the shilling, and said, ‘How’s that?’ And we said ‘A1.’ And all the evening we talked of our fortune that we had begun to make. Nobody came next day, but the day after a lady came to ask for money to build an orphanage for the children of dead sailors. And we saw her. I went in with Alice. And when we had explained to her that we had only a shilling and we wanted it for something else, Alice suddenly said, ‘Would you like some wine?’ And the lady said, ‘Thank you very much,’ but she looked surprised. She was not a young lady, and she had a mantle with beads, and the beads had come off in places, leaving a browny braid showing, and she had printed papers about the dead sailors in a sealskin bag, and the seal had come off in places, leaving the skin bare. We gave her a tablespoonful of the wine in a proper wine-glass out of the sideboard, because she was a lady. And when she had tasted it she got up in a very great hurry, and shook out her dress and snapped her bag shut, and said, ‘You naughty, wicked children! What do you mean by playing a trick like this? You ought to be ashamed of yourselves! I shall write to your Mamma about it. You dreadful little girl!, you might have poisoned me. But your Mamma...’ Then Alice said, ‘I’m very sorry; the butcher liked it, only he said it was sweet. And please don’t write to Mother. It makes Father so unhappy when letters come for her!’, and Alice was very near crying. ‘What do you mean, you silly child?’ said the lady, looking quite bright and interested. ‘Why doesn’t your Father like your Mother to have letters, eh?’ And Alice said, ‘OH, you...!’ and began to cry, and bolted out of the room. Then I said, ‘Our Mother is dead, and will you please go away now?’ The lady looked at me a minute, and then she looked quite different, and she said, ‘I’m very sorry. I didn’t know. Never mind about the wine. I daresay your little sister meant it kindly.’ And she looked round the room just like the butcher had done. Then she said again, ‘I didn’t know, I’m very sorry...’ So I said, ‘Don’t mention it,’ and shook hands with her, and let her out. Of course we couldn’t have asked her to buy the wine after what she’d said. But I think she was not a bad sort of person. I do like a person to say they’re sorry when they ought to be, especially a grown-up. They do it so seldom. I suppose that’s why we think so much of it. But Alice and I didn’t feel jolly for ever so long afterwards. And when I went back into the dining-room I saw how different it was from when Mother was here, and we are different, and Father is different, and nothing is like it was. I am glad I am not made to think about it every day. I went and found Alice, and told her what the lady had said, and when she had finished crying we put away the bottle and said we would not try to sell any more to people who came. And we did not tell the others, we only said the lady did not buy any, but we went up on the Heath, and some soldiers went by and there was a Punch-and-judy show, and when we came back we were better. The bottle got quite dusty where we had put it, and perhaps the dust of ages would have laid thick and heavy on it, only a clergyman called when we were all out. He was not our own clergyman, Mr Bristow is our own clergyman, and we all love him, and we would not try to sell sherry to people we like, and make two pounds a week out of them in our spare time. It was another clergyman, just a stray one; and he asked Eliza if the dear children would not like to come to his little Sunday school. We always spend Sunday afternoons with Father. But as he had left the name of his vicarage with Eliza, and asked her to tell us to come, we thought we would go and call on him, just to explain about Sunday afternoons, and we thought we might as well take the sherry with us. ‘I won’t go unless you all go too,’ Alice said, ‘and I won’t do the talking.’ Dora said she thought we had much better not go; but we said ‘Rot!’ and it ended in her coming with us, and I am glad she did. Oswald said he would do the talking if the others liked, and he learned up what to say from the printed papers. We went to the Vicarage early on Saturday afternoon, and rang at the bell. It is a new red house with no trees in the garden, only very yellow mould and gravel. It was all very neat and dry. Just before we rang the bell we heard some one inside call ‘Jane! Jane!’ and we thought we would not be Jane for anything. It was the sound of the voice that called that made us sorry for her. The door was opened by a very neat servant in black, with a white apron; we saw her tying the strings as she came along the hall, through the different-coloured glass in the door. Her face was red, and I think she was Jane. We asked if we could see Mr Mallow. The servant said Mr Mallow was very busy with his sermon just then, but she would see. But Oswald said, ‘It’s all right. He asked us to come.’ So she let us all in and shut the front door, and showed us into a very tidy room with a bookcase full of a lot of books covered in black cotton with white labels, and some dull pictures, and a harmonium. And Mr Mallow was writing at a desk with drawers, copying something out of a book. He was stout and short, and wore spectacles. He covered his writing up when we went in, I didn’t know why. He looked rather cross, and we heard Jane or somebody being scolded outside by the voice. I hope it wasn’t for letting us in, but I have had doubts. ‘Well,’ said the clergyman, ‘what is all this about?’ ‘You asked us to call,’ Dora said, ‘about your little Sunday school. We are the Bastables of Lewisham Road.’ ‘Oh, ah, yes,’ he said; ‘and shall I expect you all to-morrow?’ He took up his pen and fiddled with it, and he did not ask us to sit down. But some of us did. ‘We always spend Sunday afternoon with Father,’ said Dora; ‘but we wished to thank you for being so kind as to ask us.’ ‘And we wished to ask you something else!’ said Oswald; and he made a sign to Alice to get the sherry ready in the glass. She did, behind Oswald’s back while he was speaking. ‘My time is limited,’ said Mr Mallow, looking at his watch; ‘but still, ’ Then he muttered something about the fold, and went on: ‘Tell me what is troubling you, my little man, and I will try to give you any help in my power. What is it you want?’ Then Oswald quickly took the glass from Alice, and held it out to him, and said, ‘I want your opinion on that.’ ‘On  that ,’ he said. ‘What is it?’ ‘It is a shipment,’ Oswald said; ‘but it’s quite enough for you to taste.’ Alice had filled the glass half-full; I suppose she was too excited to measure properly. ‘A shipment?’ said the clergyman, taking the glass in his hand. ‘Yes,’ Oswald went On; ‘an exceptional opportunity. Full-bodied and nutty.’ ‘It really does taste rather like one kind of Brazil-nut.’ Alice put her oar in as usual. The Vicar looked from Alice to Oswald, and back again, and Oswald went on with what he had learned from the printing. The clergyman held the glass at half-arm’s-length, stiffly, as if he had caught cold. ‘It is of a quality never before offered at the price. Old Delicate Amoro, what’s its name, ’ ‘Amorolio,’ said H. O. ‘Amoroso,’ said Oswald. ‘H. O., you just shut up, Castilian Amoroso, it’s a true after-dinner wine, stimulating and yet...’ ‘ Wine ?’ said Mr Mallow, holding the glass further off. ‘Do you  know ,’ he went on, making his voice very thick and strong (I expect he does it like that in church), ‘have you never been  taught  that it is the drinking of  wine  and  spirits , yes, and  beer , which makes half the homes in England full of  wretched  little children, and  degraded ,  miserable  parents?’ ‘Not if you put sugar in it,’ said Alice firmly; ‘eight lumps and shake the bottle. We have each had more than a teaspoonful of it, and we were not ill at all. It was something else that upset H. O. Most likely all those acorns he got out of the Park.’ The clergyman seemed to be speechless with conflicting emotions, and just then the door opened and a lady came in. She had a white cap with lace, and an ugly violet flower in it, and she was tall, and looked very strong, though thin. And I do believe she had been listening at the door. ‘But why,’ the Vicar was saying, ‘why did you bring this dreadful fluid, this curse of our country, to  me  to taste?’ ‘Because we thought you might buy some,’ said Dora, who never sees when a game is up. ‘In books the parson loves his bottle of old port; and new sherry is just as good, with sugar, for people who like sherry. And if you would order a dozen of the wine, then we should get two shillings.’ The lady said (and it  was  the voice), ‘Good gracious! Nasty, sordid little things! Haven’t they any one to teach them better?’ And Dora got up and said, ‘No, we are not those things you say; but we are sorry we came here to be called names. We want to make our fortune just as much as Mr Mallow does, only no one would listen to us if we preached, so it’s no use our copying out sermons like him.’ And I think that was smart of Dora, even if it was rather rude. Then I said perhaps we had better go, and the lady said, ‘I should think so!’ But when we were going to wrap up the bottle and glass the clergyman said, ‘No; you can leave that,’ and we were so upset we did, though it wasn’t his after all. We walked home very fast and not saying much, and the girls went up to their rooms. When I went to tell them tea was ready, and there was a teacake, Dora was crying like anything and Alice hugging her. I am afraid there is a great deal of crying in this chapter, but I can’t help it. Girls will sometimes; I suppose it is their nature, and we ought to be sorry for their affliction. ‘It’s no good,’ Dora was saying, ‘you all hate me, and you think I’m a prig and a busybody, but I do try to do right, oh, I do! Oswald, go away; don’t come here making fun of me!’ So I said, ‘I’m not making fun, Sissy; don’t cry, old girl.’ Mother taught me to call her Sissy when we were very little and before the others came, but I don’t often somehow, now we are old. I patted her on the back, and she put her head against my sleeve, holding on to Alice all the time, and she went on. She was in that laughy-cryey state when people say things they wouldn’t say at other times. ‘Oh dear, oh dear, I do try, I do. And when Mother died she said, “Dora, take care of the others, and teach them to be good, and keep them out of trouble and make them happy.” She said, “Take care of them for me, Dora dear.” And I have tried, and all of you hate me for it; and to-day I let you do this, though I knew all the time it was silly.’ I hope you will not think I was a muff but I kissed Dora for some time. Because girls like it. And I will never say again that she comes the good elder sister too much. And I have put all this in though I do hate telling about it, because I own I have been hard on Dora, but I never will be again. She is a good old sort; of course we never knew before about what Mother told her, or we wouldn’t have ragged her as we did. We did not tell the little ones, but I got Alice to speak to Dicky, and we three can sit on the others if requisite. This made us forget all about the sherry; but about eight o’clock there was a knock, and Eliza went, and we saw it was poor Jane, if her name was Jane, from the Vicarage. She handed in a brown-paper parcel and a letter. And three minutes later Father called us into his study. On the table was the brown-paper parcel, open, with our bottle and glass on it, and Father had a letter in his hand. He Pointed to the bottle and sighed, and said, ‘What have you been doing now?’ The letter in his hand was covered with little black writing, all over the four large pages. So Dicky spoke up, and he told Father the whole thing, as far as he knew it, for Alice and I had not told about the dead sailors’ lady. And when he had done, Alice said, ‘Has Mr Mallow written to you to say he will buy a dozen of the sherry after all? It is really not half bad with sugar in it.’ Father said no, he didn’t think clergymen could afford such expensive wine; and he said  he  would like to taste it. So we gave him what there was left, for we had decided coming home that we would give up trying for the two pounds a week in our spare time. Father tasted it, and then he acted just as H. O. had done when he had his teaspoonful, but of course we did not say anything. Then he laughed till I thought he would never stop. I think it was the sherry, because I am sure I have read somewhere about ‘wine that maketh glad the heart of man’. He had only a very little, which shows that it was a good after-dinner wine, stimulating, and yet ...I forget the rest. But when he had done laughing he said, ‘It’s all right, kids. Only don’t do it again. The wine trade is overcrowded; and besides, I thought you promised to consult me before going into business?’ ‘Before buying one I thought you meant,’ said Dicky. ‘This was only on commission.’ And Father laughed again. I am glad we got the Castilian Amoroso, because it did really cheer Father up, and you cannot always do that, however hard you try, even if you make jokes, or give him a comic paper. CHAPTER 12. THE NOBLENESS OF OSWALD The part about his nobleness only comes at the end, but you would not understand it unless you knew how it began. It began, like nearly everything about that time, with treasure-seeking. Of course as soon as we had promised to consult my Father about business matters we all gave up wanting to go into business. I don’t know how it is, but having to consult about a thing with grown-up people, even the bravest and the best, seems to make the thing not worth doing afterwards. We don’t mind Albert’s uncle chipping in sometimes when the thing’s going on, but we are glad he never asked us to promise to consult him about anything. Yet Oswald saw that my Father was quite right; and I daresay if we had had that hundred pounds we should have spent it on the share in that lucrative business for the sale of useful patent, and then found out afterwards that we should have done better to spend the money in some other way. My Father says so, and he ought to know. We had several ideas about that time, but having so little chink always stood in the way. This was the case with H. O.’s idea of setting up a coconut-shy on this side of the Heath, where there are none generally. We had no sticks or wooden balls, and the greengrocer said he could not book so many as twelve dozen coconuts without Mr Bastable’s written order. And as we did not wish to consult my Father it was decided to drop it. And when Alice dressed up Pincher in some of the dolls’ clothes and we made up our minds to take him round with an organ as soon as we had taught him to dance, we were stopped at once by Dicky’s remembering how he had once heard that an organ cost seven hundred pounds. Of course this was the big church kind, but even the ones on three legs can’t be got for one-and-sevenpence, which was all we had when we first thought of it. So we gave that up too. It was a wet day, I remember, and mutton hash for dinner, very tough with pale gravy with lumps in it. I think the others would have left a good deal on the sides of their plates, although they know better, only Oswald said it was a savoury stew made of the red deer that Edward shot. So then we were the Children of the New Forest, and the mutton tasted much better. No one in the New Forest minds venison being tough and the gravy pale. Then after dinner we let the girls have a dolls’ tea-party, on condition they didn’t expect us boys to wash up; and it was when we were drinking the last of the liquorice water out of the little cups that Dicky said,  ‘This reminds me.’ So we said, ‘What of?’ Dicky answered us at once, though his mouth was full of bread with liquorice stuck in it to look like cake. You should not speak with your mouth full, even to your own relations, and you shouldn’t wipe your mouth on the back of your hand, but on your handkerchief, if you have one. Dicky did not do this. He said,  ‘Why, you remember when we first began about treasure-seeking, I said I had thought of something, only I could not tell you because I hadn’t finished thinking about it.’ We said ‘Yes.’ ‘Well, this liquorice water, ’ ‘Tea,’ said Alice softly. ‘Well, tea then, made me think.’ He was going on to say what it made him think, but Noel interrupted and cried out, ‘I say; let’s finish off this old tea-party and have a council of war.’ So we got out the flags and the wooden sword and the drum, and Oswald beat it while the girls washed up, till Eliza came up to say she had the jumping toothache, and the noise went through her like a knife. So of course Oswald left off at once. When you are polite to Oswald he never refuses to grant your requests. When we were all dressed up we sat down round the camp fire, and Dicky began again. ‘Every one in the world wants money. Some people get it. The people who get it are the ones who see things. I have seen one thing.’ Dicky stopped and smoked the pipe of peace. It is the pipe we did bubbles with in the summer, and somehow it has not got broken yet. We put tea-leaves in it for the pipe of peace, but the girls are not allowed to have any. It is not right to let girls smoke. They get to think too much of themselves if you let them do everything the same as men. Oswald said, ‘Out with it.’ ‘I see that glass bottles only cost a penny. H. O., if you dare to snigger I’ll send you round selling old bottles, and you shan’t have any sweets except out of the money you get for them. And the same with you, Noel.’ ‘Noel wasn’t sniggering,’ said Alice in a hurry; ‘it is only his taking so much interest in what you were saying makes him look like that. Be quiet, H. O., and don’t you make faces, either. Do go on, Dicky dear.’ So Dicky went on. ‘There must be hundreds of millions of bottles of medicines sold every year. Because all the different medicines say, “Thousands of cures daily,” and if you only take that as two thousand, which it must be, at least, it mounts up. And the people who sell them must make a great deal of money by them because they are nearly always two-and-ninepence the bottle, and three-and-six for one nearly double the size. Now the bottles, as I was saying, don’t cost anything like that.’ ‘It’s the medicine costs the money,’ said Dora; ‘look how expensive jujubes are at the chemist’s, and peppermints too.’ ‘That’s only because they’re nice,’ Dicky explained; ‘nasty things are not so dear. Look what a lot of brimstone you get for a penny, and the same with alum. We would not put the nice kinds of chemist’s things in our medicine.’ Then he went on to tell us that when we had invented our medicine we would write and tell the editor about it, and he would put it in the paper, and then people would send their two-and-ninepence and three-and-six for the bottle nearly double the size, and then when the medicine had cured them they would write to the paper and their letters would be printed, saying how they had been suffering for years, and never thought to get about again, but thanks to the blessing of our ointment, ’ Dora interrupted and said, ‘Not ointment, it’s so messy.’ And Alice thought so too. And Dicky said he did not mean it, he was quite decided to let it be in bottles. So now it was all settled, and we did not see at the time that this would be a sort of going into business, but afterwards when Albert’s uncle showed us we saw it, and we were sorry. We only had to invent the medicine. You might think that was easy, because of the number of them you see every day in the paper, but it is much harder than you think. First we had to decide what sort of illness we should like to cure, and a ‘heated discussion ensued’, like in Parliament. Dora wanted it to be something to make the complexion of dazzling fairness, but we remembered how her face came all red and rough when she used the Rosabella soap that was advertised to make the darkest complexion fair as the lily, and she agreed that perhaps it was better not. Noel wanted to make the medicine first and then find out what it would cure, but Dicky thought not, because there are so many more medicines than there are things the matter with us, so it would be easier to choose the disease first. Oswald would have liked wounds. I still think it was a good idea, but Dicky said, ‘Who has wounds, especially now there aren’t any wars? We shouldn’t sell a bottle a day!’ So Oswald gave in because he knows what manners are, and it was Dicky’s idea. H. O. wanted a cure for the uncomfortable feeling that they give you powders for, but we explained to him that grown-up people do not have this feeling, however much they eat, and he agreed. Dicky said he did not care a straw what the loathsome disease was, as long as we hurried up and settled on something. Then Alice said,  ‘It ought to be something very common, and only one thing. Not the pains in the back and all the hundreds of things the people have in somebody’s syrup. What’s the commonest thing of all?’ And at once we said, ‘Colds.’ So that was settled. Then we wrote a label to go on the bottle. When it was written it would not go on the vinegar bottle that we had got, but we knew it would go small when it was printed. It was like this:                  BASTABLE’S            CERTAIN CURE FOR COLDS Coughs, Asthma, Shortness of Breath, and all infections of the Chest      One dose gives immediate relief    It will cure your cold in one bottle      Especially the larger size at 3s. 6d.        Order at once of the Makers        To prevent disappointment                Makers:      D., O., R., A., N., and H. O. BASTABLE              150, Lewisham Road, S.E.     (A halfpenny for all bottles returned)              , , , , , ,  Of course the next thing was for one of us to catch a cold and try what cured it; we all wanted to be the one, but it was Dicky’s idea, and he said he was not going to be done out of it, so we let him. It was only fair. He left off his undershirt that very day, and next morning he stood in a draught in his nightgown for quite a long time. And we damped his day-shirt with the nail-brush before he put it on. But all was vain. They always tell you that these things will give you cold, but we found it was not so. So then we all went over to the Park, and Dicky went right into the water with his boots on, and stood there as long as he could bear it, for it was rather cold, and we stood and cheered him on. He walked home in his wet clothes, which they say is a sure thing, but it was no go, though his boots were quite spoiled. And three days after Noel began to cough and sneeze. So then Dicky said it was not fair. ‘I can’t help it,’ Noel said. ‘You should have caught it yourself, then it wouldn’t have come to me.’ And Alice said she had known all along Noel oughtn’t to have stood about on the bank cheering in the cold. Noel had to go to bed, and then we began to make the medicines; we were sorry he was out of it, but he had the fun of taking the things. We made a great many medicines. Alice made herb tea. She got sage and thyme and savory and marjoram and boiled them all up together with salt and water, but she  would  put parsley in too. Oswald is sure parsley is not a herb. It is only put on the cold meat and you are not supposed to eat it. It kills parrots to eat parsley, I believe. I expect it was the parsley that disagreed so with Noel. The medicine did not seem to do the cough any good. Oswald got a pennyworth of alum, because it is so cheap, and some turpentine which every one knows is good for colds, and a little sugar and an aniseed ball. These were mixed in a bottle with water, but Eliza threw it away and said it was nasty rubbish, and I hadn’t any money to get more things with. Dora made him some gruel, and he said it did his chest good; but of course that was no use, because you cannot put gruel in bottles and say it is medicine. It would not be honest, and besides nobody would believe you. Dick mixed up lemon-juice and sugar and a little of the juice of the red flannel that Noel’s throat was done up in. It comes out beautifully in hot water. Noel took this and he liked it. Noel’s own idea was liquorice-water, and we let him have it, but it is too plain and black to sell in bottles at the proper price. Noel liked H. O.’s medicine the best, which was silly of him, because it was only peppermints melted in hot water, and a little cobalt to make it look blue. It was all right, because H. O.’s paint-box is the French kind, with Couleurs non Veneneuses on it. This means you may suck your brushes if you want to, or even your paints if you are a very little boy. It was rather jolly while Noel had that cold. He had a fire in his bedroom which opens out of Dicky’s and Oswald’s, and the girls used to read aloud to Noel all day; they will not read aloud to you when you are well. Father was away at Liverpool on business, and Albert’s uncle was at Hastings. We were rather glad of this, because we wished to give all the medicines a fair trial, and grown-ups are but too fond of interfering. As if we should have given him anything poisonous! His cold went on, it was bad in his head, but it was not one of the kind when he has to have poultices and can’t sit up in bed. But when it had been in his head nearly a week, Oswald happened to tumble over Alice on the stairs. When we got up she was crying. ‘Don’t cry silly!’ said Oswald; ‘you know I didn’t hurt you.’ I was very sorry if I had hurt her, but you ought not to sit on the stairs in the dark and let other people tumble over you. You ought to remember how beastly it is for them if they do hurt you. ‘Oh, it’s not that, Oswald,’ Alice said. ‘Don’t be a pig! I am so miserable. Do be kind to me.’ So Oswald thumped her on the back and told her to shut up. ‘It’s about Noel,’ she said. ‘I’m sure he’s very ill; and playing about with medicines is all very well, but I know he’s ill, and Eliza won’t send for the doctor: she says it’s only a cold. And I know the doctor’s bills are awful. I heard Father telling Aunt Emily so in the summer. But he  is  ill, and perhaps he’ll die or something.’ Then she began to cry again. Oswald thumped her again, because he knows how a good brother ought to behave, and said, ‘Cheer up.’ If we had been in a book Oswald would have embraced his little sister tenderly, and mingled his tears with hers. Then Oswald said, ‘Why not write to Father?’ And she cried more and said, ‘I’ve lost the paper with the address. H. O. had it to draw on the back of, and I can’t find it now; I’ve looked everywhere. I’ll tell you what I’m going to do. No I won’t. But I’m going out. Don’t tell the others. And I say, Oswald, do pretend I’m in if Eliza asks. Promise.’ ‘Tell me what you’re going to do,’ I said. But she said ‘No’; and there was a good reason why not. So I said I wouldn’t promise if it came to that. Of course I meant to all right. But it did seem mean of her not to tell me. So Alice went out by the side door while Eliza was setting tea, and she was a long time gone; she was not in to tea. When Eliza asked Oswald where she was he said he did not know, but perhaps she was tidying her corner drawer. Girls often do this, and it takes a long time. Noel coughed a good bit after tea, and asked for Alice. Oswald told him she was doing something and it was a secret. Oswald did not tell any lies even to save his sister. When Alice came back she was very quiet, but she whispered to Oswald that it was all right. When it was rather late Eliza said she was going out to post a letter. This always takes her an hour, because she  will  go to the post-office across the Heath instead of the pillar-box, because once a boy dropped fusees in our pillar-box and burnt the letters. It was not any of us; Eliza told us about it. And when there was a knock at the door a long time after we thought it was Eliza come back, and that she had forgotten the back-door key. We made H. O. go down to open the door, because it is his place to run about: his legs are younger than ours. And we heard boots on the stairs besides H. O.’s, and we listened spellbound till the door opened, and it was Albert’s uncle. He looked very tired. ‘I am glad you’ve come,’ Oswald said. ‘Alice began to think Noel, ’ Alice stopped me, and her face was very red, her nose was shiny too, with having cried so much before tea. She said, ‘I only said I thought Noel ought to have the doctor. Don’t you think he ought?’ She got hold of Albert’s uncle and held on to him. ‘Let’s have a look at you, young man,’ said Albert’s uncle, and he sat down on the edge of the bed. It is a rather shaky bed, the bar that keeps it steady underneath got broken when we were playing burglars last winter. It was our crowbar. He began to feel Noel’s pulse, and went on talking. ‘It was revealed to the Arab physician as he made merry in his tents on the wild plains of Hastings that the Presence had a cold in its head. So he immediately seated himself on the magic carpet, and bade it bear him hither, only pausing in the flight to purchase a few sweetmeats in the bazaar.’ He pulled out a jolly lot of chocolate and some butterscotch, and grapes for Noel. When we had all said thank you, he went on. ‘The physician’s are the words of wisdom: it’s high time this kid was asleep. I have spoken. Ye have my leave to depart.’ So we bunked, and Dora and Albert’s uncle made Noel comfortable for the night. Then they came to the nursery which we had gone down to, and he sat down in the Guy Fawkes chair and said, ‘Now then.’ Alice said, ‘You may tell them what I did. I daresay they’ll all be in a wax, but I don’t care.’ ‘I think you were very wise,’ said Albert’s uncle, pulling her close to him to sit on his knee. ‘I am very glad you telegraphed.’ So then Oswald understood what Alice’s secret was. She had gone out and sent a telegram to Albert’s uncle at Hastings. But Oswald thought she might have told him. Afterwards she told me what she had put in the telegram. It was, ‘Come home. We have given Noel a cold, and I think we are killing him.’ With the address it came to tenpence-halfpenny. Then Albert’s uncle began to ask questions, and it all came out, how Dicky had tried to catch the cold, but the cold had gone to Noel instead, and about the medicines and all. Albert’s uncle looked very serious. ‘Look here,’ he said, ‘You’re old enough not to play the fool like this. Health is the best thing you’ve got; you ought to know better than to risk it. You might have killed your little brother with your precious medicines. You’ve had a lucky escape, certainly. But poor Noel!’ ‘Oh, do you think he’s going to die?’ Alice asked that, and she was crying again. ‘No, no,’ said Albert’s uncle; ‘but look here. Do you see how silly you’ve been? And I thought you promised your Father, ’ And then he gave us a long talking-to. He can make you feel most awfully small. At last he stopped, and we said we were very sorry, and he said, ‘You know I promised to take you all to the pantomime?’ So we said, ‘Yes,’ and knew but too well that now he wasn’t going to. Then he went on,  ‘Well, I will take you if you like, or I will take Noel to the sea for a week to cure his cold. Which is it to be?’ Of course he knew we should say, ‘Take Noel’ and we did; but Dicky told me afterwards he thought it was hard on H. O. Albert’s uncle stayed till Eliza came in, and then he said good night in a way that showed us that all was forgiven and forgotten. And we went to bed. It must have been the middle of the night when Oswald woke up suddenly, and there was Alice with her teeth chattering, shaking him to wake him. ‘Oh, Oswald!’ she said, ‘I am so unhappy. Suppose I should die in the night!’ Oswald told her to go to bed and not gas. But she said, ‘I must tell you; I wish I’d told Albert’s uncle. I’m a thief, and if I die to-night I know where thieves go to.’ So Oswald saw it was no good and he sat up in bed and said, ‘Go ahead.’ So Alice stood shivering and said, ‘I hadn’t enough money for the telegram, so I took the bad sixpence out of the exchequer. And I paid for it with that and the fivepence I had. And I wouldn’t tell you, because if you’d stopped me doing it I couldn’t have borne it; and if you’d helped me you’d have been a thief too. Oh, what shall I do?’ Oswald thought a minute, and then he said,  ‘You’d better have told me. But I think it will be all right if we pay it back. Go to bed. Cross with you? No, stupid! Only another time you’d better not keep secrets.’ So she kissed Oswald, and he let her, and she went back to bed. The next day Albert’s uncle took Noel away, before Oswald had time to persuade Alice that we ought to tell him about the sixpence. Alice was very unhappy, but not so much as in the night: you can be very miserable in the night if you have done anything wrong and you happen to be awake. I know this for a fact. None of us had any money except Eliza, and she wouldn’t give us any unless we said what for; and of course we could not do that because of the honour of the family. And Oswald was anxious to get the sixpence to give to the telegraph people because he feared that the badness of that sixpence might have been found out, and that the police might come for Alice at any moment. I don’t think I ever had such an unhappy day. Of course we could have written to Albert’s uncle, but it would have taken a long time, and every moment of delay added to Alice’s danger. We thought and thought, but we couldn’t think of any way to get that sixpence. It seems a small sum, but you see Alice’s liberty depended on it. It was quite late in the afternoon when I met Mrs Leslie on the Parade. She had a brown fur coat and a lot of yellow flowers in her hands. She stopped to speak to me, and asked me how the Poet was. I told her he had a cold, and I wondered whether she would lend me sixpence if I asked her, but I could not make up my mind how to begin to say it. It is a hard thing to say, much harder than you would think. She talked to me for a bit, and then she suddenly got into a cab, and said,  ‘I’d no idea it was so late,’ and told the man where to go. And just as she started she shoved the yellow flowers through the window and said, ‘For the sick poet, with my love,’ and was driven off. Gentle reader, I will not conceal from you what Oswald did. He knew all about not disgracing the family, and he did not like doing what I am going to say: and they were really Noel’s flowers, only he could not have sent them to Hastings, and Oswald knew he would say ‘Yes’ if Oswald asked him. Oswald sacrificed his family pride because of his little sister’s danger. I do not say he was a noble boy, I just tell you what he did, and you can decide for yourself about the nobleness. He put on his oldest clothes, they’re much older than any you would think he had if you saw him when he was tidy, and he took those yellow chrysanthemums and he walked with them to Greenwich Station and waited for the trains bringing people from London. He sold those flowers in penny bunches and got tenpence. Then he went to the telegraph office at Lewisham, and said to the lady there: ‘A little girl gave you a bad sixpence yesterday. Here are six good pennies.’ The lady said she had not noticed it, and never mind, but Oswald knew that ‘Honesty is the best Policy’, and he refused to take back the pennies. So at last she said she should put them in the plate on Sunday. She is a very nice lady. I like the way she does her hair. Then Oswald went home to Alice and told her, and she hugged him, and said he was a dear, good, kind boy, and he said ‘Oh, it’s all right.’ We bought peppermint bullseyes with the fourpence I had over, and the others wanted to know where we got the money, but we would not tell. Only afterwards when Noel came home we told him, because they were his flowers, and he said it was quite right. He made some poetry about it. I only remember one bit of it.     The noble youth of high degree     Consents to play a menial part,     All for his sister Alice’s sake,     Who was so dear to his faithful heart. But Oswald himself has never bragged about it. We got no treasure out of this, unless you count the peppermint bullseyes. CHAPTER 13. THE ROBBER AND THE BURGLAR A day or two after Noel came back from Hastings there was snow; it was jolly. And we cleared it off the path. A man to do it is sixpence at least, and you should always save when you can. A penny saved is a penny earned. And then we thought it would be nice to clear it off the top of the portico, where it lies so thick, and the edges as if they had been cut with a knife. And just as we had got out of the landing-window on to the portico, the Water Rates came up the path with his book that he tears the thing out of that says how much you have got to pay, and the little ink-bottle hung on to his buttonhole in case you should pay him. Father says the Water Rates is a sensible man, and knows it is always well to be prepared for whatever happens, however unlikely. Alice said afterwards that she rather liked the Water Rates, really, and Noel said he had a face like a good vizier, or the man who rewards the honest boy for restoring the purse, but we did not think about these things at the time, and as the Water Rates came up the steps, we shovelled down a great square slab of snow like an avalanche, and it fell right on his head. Two of us thought of it at the same moment, so it was quite a large avalanche. And when the Water Rates had shaken himself he rang the bell. It was Saturday, and Father was at home. We know now that it is very wrong and ungentlemanly to shovel snow off porticoes on to the Water Rates, or any other person, and we hope he did not catch a cold, and we are very sorry. We apologized to the Water Rates when Father told us to. We were all sent to bed for it. We all deserved the punishment, because the others would have shovelled down snow just as we did if they’d thought of it, only they are not so quick at thinking of things as we are. And even quite wrong things sometimes lead to adventures; as every one knows who has ever read about pirates or highwaymen. Eliza hates us to be sent to bed early, because it means her having to bring meals up, and it means lighting the fire in Noel’s room ever so much earlier than usual. He had to have a fire because he still had a bit of a cold. But this particular day we got Eliza into a good temper by giving her a horrid brooch with pretending amethysts in it, that an aunt once gave to Alice, so Eliza brought up an extra scuttle of coals, and when the greengrocer came with the potatoes (he is always late on Saturdays) she got some chestnuts from him. So that when we heard Father go out after his dinner, there was a jolly fire in Noel’s room, and we were able to go in and be Red Indians in blankets most comfortably. Eliza had gone out; she says she gets things cheaper on Saturday nights. She has a great friend, who sells fish at a shop, and he is very generous, and lets her have herrings for less than half the natural price. So we were all alone in the house; Pincher was out with Eliza, and we talked about robbers. And Dora thought it would be a dreadful trade, but Dicky said,  ‘I think it would be very interesting. And you would only rob rich people, and be very generous to the poor and needy, like Claude Duval.’ Dora said, ‘It is wrong to be a robber.’ ‘Yes,’ said Alice, ‘you would never know a happy hour. Think of trying to sleep with the stolen jewels under your bed, and remembering all the quantities of policemen and detectives that there are in the world!’ ‘There are ways of being robbers that are not wrong,’ said Noel; ‘if you can rob a robber it is a right act.’ ‘But you can’t,’ said Dora; ‘he is too clever, and besides, it’s wrong anyway.’ ‘Yes you can, and it isn’t; and murdering him with boiling oil is a right act, too, so there!’ said Noel. ‘What about Ali Baba? Now then!’ And we felt it was a score for Noel. ‘What would you do if there  was  a robber?’ said Alice. H. O. said he would kill him with boiling oil; but Alice explained that she meant a real robber, now, this minute, in the house. Oswald and Dicky did not say; but Noel said he thought it would only be fair to ask the robber quite politely and quietly to go away, and then if he didn’t you could deal with him. Now what I am going to tell you is a very strange and wonderful thing, and I hope you will be able to believe it. I should not, if a boy told me, unless I knew him to be a man of honour, and perhaps not then unless he gave his sacred word. But it is true, all the same, and it only shows that the days of romance and daring deeds are not yet at an end. Alice was just asking Noel  how  he would deal with the robber who wouldn’t go if he was asked politely and quietly, when we heard a noise downstairs, quite a plain noise, not the kind of noise you fancy you hear. It was like somebody moving a chair. We held our breath and listened and then came another noise, like some one poking a fire. Now, you remember there was no one  to  poke a fire or move a chair downstairs, because Eliza and Father were both out. They could not have come in without our hearing them, because the front door is as hard to shut as the back one, and whichever you go in by you have to give a slam that you can hear all down the street. H. O. and Alice and Dora caught hold of each other’s blankets and looked at Dicky and Oswald, and every one was quite pale. And Noel whispered,  ‘It’s ghosts, I know it is’, and then we listened again, but there was no more noise. Presently Dora said in a whisper,  ‘Whatever shall we do? Oh, whatever shall we do, what  shall  we do?’ And she kept on saying it till we had to tell her to shut up. O reader, have you ever been playing Red Indians in blankets round a bedroom fire in a house where you thought there was no one but you, and then suddenly heard a noise like a chair, and a fire being poked, downstairs? Unless you have you will not be able to imagine at all what it feels like. It was not like in books; our hair did not stand on end at all, and we never said ‘Hist!’ once, but our feet got very cold, though we were in blankets by the fire, and the insides of Oswald’s hands got warm and wet, and his nose was cold like a dog’s, and his ears were burning hot. The girls said afterwards that they shivered with terror, and their teeth chattered, but we did not see or hear this at the time. ‘Shall we open the window and call police?’ said Dora; and then Oswald suddenly thought of something, and he breathed more freely and he said,  ‘I  know  it’s not ghosts, and I don’t believe it’s robbers. I expect it’s a stray cat got in when the coals came this morning, and she’s been hiding in the cellar, and now she’s moving about. Let’s go down and see.’ The girls wouldn’t, of course; but I could see that they breathed more freely too. But Dicky said, ‘All right; I will if you will.’ H. O. said, ‘Do you think it’s  really  a cat?’ So we said he had better stay with the girls. And of course after that we had to let him and Alice both come. Dora said if we took Noel down with his cold, she would scream ‘Fire!’ and ‘Murder!’ and she didn’t mind if the whole street heard. So Noel agreed to be getting his clothes on, and the rest of us said we would go down and look for the cat. Now Oswald  said  that about the cat, and it made it easier to go down, but in his inside he did not feel at all sure that it might not be robbers after all. Of course, we had often talked about robbers before, but it is very different when you sit in a room and listen and listen and listen; and Oswald felt somehow that it would be easier to go down and see what it was, than to wait, and listen, and wait, and wait, and listen, and wait, and then perhaps to hear  it , whatever it was, come creeping slowly up the stairs as softly as  it  could with  its  boots off, and the stairs creaking, towards the room where we were with the door open in case of Eliza coming back suddenly, and all dark on the landings. And then it would have been just as bad, and it would have lasted longer, and you would have known you were a coward besides. Dicky says he felt all these same things. Many people would say we were young heroes to go down as we did; so I have tried to explain, because no young hero wishes to have more credit than he deserves. The landing gas was turned down low, just a blue bead, and we four went out very softly, wrapped in our blankets, and we stood on the top of the stairs a good long time before we began to go down. And we listened and listened till our ears buzzed. And Oswald whispered to Dicky, and Dicky went into our room and fetched the large toy pistol that is a foot long, and that has the trigger broken, and I took it because I am the eldest; and I don’t think either of us thought it was the cat now. But Alice and H. O. did. Dicky got the poker out of Noel’s room, and told Dora it was to settle the cat with when we caught her. Then Oswald whispered, ‘Let’s play at burglars; Dicky and I are armed to the teeth, we will go first. You keep a flight behind us, and be a reinforcement if we are attacked. Or you can retreat and defend the women and children in the fortress, if you’d rather.’ But they said they would be a reinforcement. Oswald’s teeth chattered a little when he spoke. It was not with anything else except cold. So Dicky and Oswald crept down, and when we got to the bottom of the stairs, we saw Father’s study door just ajar, and the crack of light. And Oswald was so pleased to see the light, knowing that burglars prefer the dark, or at any rate the dark lantern, that he felt really sure it  was  the cat after all, and then he thought it would be fun to make the others upstairs think it was really a robber. So he cocked the pistol, you can cock it, but it doesn’t go off, and he said, ‘Come on, Dick!’ and he rushed at the study door and burst into the room, crying, ‘Surrender! you are discovered! Surrender, or I fire! Throw up your hands!’ And, as he finished saying it, he saw before him, standing on the study hearthrug, a Real Robber. There was no mistake about it. Oswald was sure it was a robber, because it had a screwdriver in its hands, and was standing near the cupboard door that H. O. broke the lock off; and there were gimlets and screws and things on the floor. There is nothing in that cupboard but old ledgers and magazines and the tool chest, but of course, a robber could not know that beforehand. When Oswald saw that there really was a robber, and that he was so heavily armed with the screwdriver, he did not feel comfortable. But he kept the pistol pointed at the robber, and, you will hardly believe it, but it is true, the robber threw down the screwdriver clattering on the other tools, and he  did  throw up his hands, and said,  ‘I surrender; don’t shoot me! How many of you are there?’ So Dicky said, ‘You are outnumbered. Are you armed?’ And the robber said, ‘No, not in the least.’ And Oswald said, still pointing the pistol, and feeling very strong and brave and as if he was in a book, ‘Turn out your pockets.’ The robber did: and while he turned them out, we looked at him. He was of the middle height, and clad in a black frock-coat and grey trousers. His boots were a little gone at the sides, and his shirt-cuffs were a bit frayed, but otherwise he was of gentlemanly demeanour. He had a thin, wrinkled face, with big, light eyes that sparkled, and then looked soft very queerly, and a short beard. In his youth it must have been of a fair golden colour, but now it was tinged with grey. Oswald was sorry for him, especially when he saw that one of his pockets had a large hole in it, and that he had nothing in his pockets but letters and string and three boxes of matches, and a pipe and a handkerchief and a thin tobacco pouch and two pennies. We made him put all the things on the table, and then he said,  ‘Well, you’ve caught me; what are you going to do with me? Police?’ Alice and H. O. had come down to be reinforcements, when they heard a shout, and when Alice saw that it was a Real Robber, and that he had surrendered, she clapped her hands and said, ‘Bravo, boys!’ and so did H. O. And now she said, ‘If he gives his word of honour not to escape, I shouldn’t call the police: it seems a pity. Wait till Father comes home.’ The robber agreed to this, and gave his word of honour, and asked if he might put on a pipe, and we said ‘Yes,’ and he sat in Father’s armchair and warmed his boots, which steamed, and I sent H. O. and Alice to put on some clothes and tell the others, and bring down Dicky’s and my knickerbockers, and the rest of the chestnuts. And they all came, and we sat round the fire, and it was jolly. The robber was very friendly, and talked to us a great deal. ‘I wasn’t always in this low way of business,’ he said, when Noel said something about the things he had turned out of his pockets. ‘It’s a great come-down to a man like me. But, if I must be caught, it’s something to be caught by brave young heroes like you. My stars! How you did bolt into the room,, “Surrender, and up with your hands!” You might have been born and bred to the thief-catching.’ Oswald is sorry if it was mean, but he could not own up just then that he did not think there was any one in the study when he did that brave if rash act. He has told since. ‘And what made you think there was any one in the house?’ the robber asked, when he had thrown his head back, and laughed for quite half a minute. So we told him. And he applauded our valour, and Alice and H. O. explained that they would have said ‘Surrender,’ too, only they were reinforcements. The robber ate some of the chestnuts, and we sat and wondered when Father would come home, and what he would say to us for our intrepid conduct. And the robber told us of all the things he had done before he began to break into houses. Dicky picked up the tools from the floor, and suddenly he said,  ‘Why, this is Father’s screwdriver and his gimlets, and all! Well, I do call it jolly cheek to pick a man’s locks with his own tools!’ ‘True, true,’ said the robber. ‘It is cheek, of the jolliest! But you see I’ve come down in the world. I was a highway robber once, but horses are so expensive to hire, five shillings an hour, you know, and I couldn’t afford to keep them. The highwayman business isn’t what it was.’ ‘What about a bike?’ said H. O. But the robber thought cycles were low, and besides you couldn’t go across country with them when occasion arose, as you could with a trusty steed. And he talked of highwaymen as if he knew just how we liked hearing it. Then he told us how he had been a pirate captain, and how he had sailed over waves mountains high, and gained rich prizes, and how he  did  begin to think that here he had found a profession to his mind. ‘I don’t say there are no ups and downs in it,’ he said, ‘especially in stormy weather. But what a trade! And a sword at your side, and the Jolly Roger flying at the peak, and a prize in sight. And all the black mouths of your guns pointed at the laden trader, and the wind in your favour, and your trusty crew ready to live and die for you! Oh, but it’s a grand life!’ I did feel so sorry for him. He used such nice words, and he had a gentleman’s voice. ‘I’m sure you weren’t brought up to be a pirate,’ said Dora. She had dressed even to her collar, and made Noel do it too, but the rest of us were in blankets with just a few odd things put on anyhow underneath. The robber frowned and sighed. ‘No,’ he said, ‘I was brought up to the law. I was at Balliol, bless your hearts, and that’s true anyway.’ He sighed again, and looked hard at the fire. ‘That was my Father’s college,’ H. O. was beginning, but Dicky said, ‘Why did you leave off being a pirate?’ ‘A pirate?’ he said, as if he had not been thinking of such things. ‘Oh, yes; why I gave it up because, because I could not get over the dreadful sea-sickness.’ ‘Nelson was sea-sick,’ said Oswald. ‘Ah,’ said the robber; ‘but I hadn’t his luck or his pluck, or something. He stuck to it and won Trafalgar, didn’t he? “Kiss me, Hardy”, and all that, eh?  I  couldn’t stick to it, I had to resign. And nobody kissed  me .’ I saw by his understanding about Nelson that he was really a man who had been to a good school as well as to Balliol. Then we asked him, ‘And what did you do then?’ And Alice asked if he was ever a coiner, and we told him how we had thought we’d caught the desperate gang next door, and he was very much interested and said he was glad he had never taken to coining. ‘Besides, the coins are so ugly nowadays,’ he said, ‘no one could really find any pleasure in making them. And it’s a hole-and-corner business at the best, isn’t it?, and it must be a very thirsty one, with the hot metal and furnaces and things.’ And again he looked at the fire. Oswald forgot for a minute that the interesting stranger was a robber, and asked him if he wouldn’t have a drink. Oswald has heard Father do this to his friends, so he knows it is the right thing. The robber said he didn’t mind if he did. And that is right, too. And Dora went and got a bottle of Father’s ale, the Light Sparkling Family, and a glass, and we gave it to the robber. Dora said she would be responsible. Then when he had had a drink he told us about bandits, but he said it was so bad in wet weather. Bandits’ caves were hardly ever properly weathertight. And bush-ranging was the same. ‘As a matter of fact,’ he said, ‘I was bush-ranging this afternoon, among the furze-bushes on the Heath, but I had no luck. I stopped the Lord Mayor in his gilt coach, with all his footmen in plush and gold lace, smart as cockatoos. But it was no go. The Lord Mayor hadn’t a stiver in his pockets. One of the footmen had six new pennies: the Lord Mayor always pays his servants’ wages in new pennies. I spent fourpence of that in bread and cheese, that on the table’s the tuppence. Ah, it’s a poor trade!’ And then he filled his pipe again. We had turned out the gas, so that Father should have a jolly good surprise when he did come home, and we sat and talked as pleasant as could be. I never liked a new man better than I liked that robber. And I felt so sorry for him. He told us he had been a war-correspondent and an editor, in happier days, as well as a horse-stealer and a colonel of dragoons. And quite suddenly, just as we were telling him about Lord Tottenham and our being highwaymen ourselves, he put up his hand and said ‘Shish!’ and we were quiet and listened. There was a scrape, scrape, scraping noise; it came from downstairs. ‘They’re filing something,’ whispered the robber, ‘here, shut up, give me that pistol, and the poker. There is a burglar now, and no mistake.’ ‘It’s only a toy one and it won’t go off,’ I said, ‘but you can cock it.’ Then we heard a snap. ‘There goes the window bar,’ said the robber softly. ‘Jove! what an adventure! You kids stay here, I’ll tackle it.’ But Dicky and I said we should come. So he let us go as far as the bottom of the kitchen stairs, and we took the tongs and shovel with us. There was a light in the kitchen; a very little light. It is curious we never thought, any of us, that this might be a plant of our robber’s to get away. We never thought of doubting his word of honour. And we were right. That noble robber dashed the kitchen door open, and rushed in with the big toy pistol in one hand and the poker in the other, shouting out just like Oswald had done,  ‘Surrender! You are discovered! Surrender, or I’ll fire! Throw up your hands!’ And Dicky and I rattled the tongs and shovel so that he might know there were more of us, all bristling with weapons. And we heard a husky voice in the kitchen saying,  ‘All right, governor! Stow that scent sprinkler. I’ll give in. Blowed if I ain’t pretty well sick of the job, anyway.’ Then we went in. Our robber was standing in the grandest manner with his legs very wide apart, and the pistol pointing at the cowering burglar. The burglar was a large man who did not mean to have a beard, I think, but he had got some of one, and a red comforter, and a fur cap, and his face was red and his voice was thick. How different from our own robber! The burglar had a dark lantern, and he was standing by the plate-basket. When we had lit the gas we all thought he was very like what a burglar ought to be. He did not look as if he could ever have been a pirate or a highwayman, or anything really dashing or noble, and he scowled and shuffled his feet and said: ‘Well, go on: why don’t yer fetch the pleece?’ ‘Upon my word, I don’t know,’ said our robber, rubbing his chin. ‘Oswald, why don’t we fetch the police?’ It is not every robber that I would stand Christian names from, I can tell you but just then I didn’t think of that. I just said, ‘Do you mean I’m to fetch one?’ Our robber looked at the burglar and said nothing. Then the burglar began to speak very fast, and to look different ways with his hard, shiny little eyes. ‘Lookee ‘ere, governor,’ he said, ‘I was stony broke, so help me, I was. And blessed if I’ve nicked a haporth of your little lot. You know yourself there ain’t much to tempt a bloke,’ he shook the plate-basket as if he was angry with it, and the yellowy spoons and forks rattled. ‘I was just a-looking through this ‘ere Bank-ollerday show, when you come. Let me off, sir. Come now, I’ve got kids of my own at home, strike me if I ain’t, same as yours, I’ve got a nipper just about ‘is size, and what’ll come of them if I’m lagged? I ain’t been in it long, sir, and I ain’t ‘andy at it.’ ‘No,’ said our robber; ‘you certainly are not.’ Alice and the others had come down by now to see what was happening. Alice told me afterwards they thought it really was the cat this time. ‘No, I ain’t ‘andy, as you say, sir, and if you let me off this once I’ll chuck the whole blooming bizz; rake my civvy, I will. Don’t be hard on a cove, mister; think of the missis and the kids. I’ve got one just the cut of little missy there bless ‘er pretty ‘eart.’ ‘Your family certainly fits your circumstances very nicely,’ said our robber. Then Alice said,  ‘Oh, do let him go! If he’s got a little girl like me, whatever will she do? Suppose it was Father!’ ‘I don’t think he’s got a little girl like you, my dear,’ said our robber, ‘and I think he’ll be safer under lock and key.’ ‘You ask yer Father to let me go, miss,’ said the burglar; ‘’e won’t ‘ave the ‘art to refuse you.’ ‘If I do,’ said Alice, ‘will you promise never to come back?’ ‘Not me, miss,’ the burglar said very earnestly, and he looked at the plate-basket again, as if that alone would be enough to keep him away, our robber said afterwards. ‘And will you be good and not rob any more?’ said Alice. ‘I’ll turn over a noo leaf, miss, so help me.’ Then Alice said, ‘Oh, do let him go! I’m sure he’ll be good.’ But our robber said no, it wouldn’t be right; we must wait till Father came home. Then H. O. said, very suddenly and plainly: ‘I don’t think it’s at all fair, when you’re a robber yourself.’ The minute he’d said it the burglar said, ‘Kidded, by gum!’, and then our robber made a step towards him to catch hold of him, and before you had time to think ‘Hullo!’ the burglar knocked the pistol up with one hand and knocked our robber down with the other, and was off out of the window like a shot, though Oswald and Dicky did try to stop him by holding on to his legs. And that burglar had the cheek to put his head in at the window and say, ‘I’ll give yer love to the kids and the missis’, and he was off like winking, and there were Alice and Dora trying to pick up our robber, and asking him whether he was hurt, and where. He wasn’t hurt at all, except a lump at the back of his head. And he got up, and we dusted the kitchen floor off him. Eliza is a dirty girl. Then he said, ‘Let’s put up the shutters. It never rains but it pours. Now you’ve had two burglars I daresay you’ll have twenty.’ So we put up the shutters, which Eliza has strict orders to do before she goes out, only she never does, and we went back to Father’s study, and the robber said, ‘What a night we are having!’ and put his boots back in the fender to go on steaming, and then we all talked at once. It was the most wonderful adventure we ever had, though it wasn’t treasure-seeking, at least not ours. I suppose it was the burglar’s treasure-seeking, but he didn’t get much, and our robber said he didn’t believe a word about those kids that were so like Alice and me. And then there was the click of the gate, and we said, ‘Here’s Father,’ and the robber said, ‘And now for the police.’ Then we all jumped up. We did like him so much, and it seemed so unfair that he should be sent to prison, and the horrid, lumping big burglar not. And Alice said, ‘Oh,  no , run! Dicky will let you out at the back door. Oh, do go, go  now .’ And we all said, ‘Yes,  go ,’ and pulled him towards the door, and gave him his hat and stick and the things out of his pockets. But Father’s latchkey was in the door, and it was too late. Father came in quickly, purring with the cold, and began to say, ‘It’s all right, Foulkes, I’ve got, ’ And then he stopped short and stared at us. Then he said, in the voice we all hate, ‘Children, what is the meaning of all this?’ And for a minute nobody spoke. Then my Father said, ‘Foulkes, I must really apologize for these very naughty, ’ And then our robber rubbed his hands and laughed, and cried out: ‘You’re mistaken, my dear sir, I’m not Foulkes; I’m a robber, captured by these young people in the most gallant manner. “Hands up, surrender, or I fire,” and all the rest of it. My word, Bastable, but you’ve got some kids worth having! I wish my Denny had their pluck.’ Then we began to understand, and it was like being knocked down, it was so sudden. And our robber told us he wasn’t a robber after all. He was only an old college friend of my Father’s, and he had come after dinner, when Father was just trying to mend the lock H. O. had broken, to ask Father to get him a letter to a doctor about his little boy Denny, who was ill. And Father had gone over the Heath to Vanbrugh Park to see some rich people he knows and get the letter. And he had left Mr Foulkes to wait till he came back, because it was important to know at once whether Father could get the letter, and if he couldn’t Mr Foulkes would have had to try some one else directly. We were dumb with amazement. Our robber told my Father about the other burglar, and said he was sorry he’d let him escape, but my Father said, ‘Oh, it’s all right: poor beggar; if he really had kids at home: you never can tell, forgive us our debts, don’t you know; but tell me about the first business. It must have been moderately entertaining.’ Then our robber told my Father how I had rushed into the room with a pistol, crying out... but you know all about that. And he laid it on so thick and fat about plucky young-uns, and chips of old blocks, and things like that, that I felt I was purple with shame, even under the blanket. So I swallowed that thing that tries to prevent you speaking when you ought to, and I said, ‘Look here, Father, I didn’t really think there was any one in the study. We thought it was a cat at first, and then I thought there was no one there, and I was just larking. And when I said surrender and all that, it was just the game, don’t you know?’ Then our robber said, ‘Yes, old chap; but when you found there really  was  someone there, you dropped the pistol and bunked, didn’t you, eh?’ And I said, ‘No; I thought, “Hullo! here’s a robber! Well, it’s all up, I suppose, but I may as well hold on and see what happens.”’ And I was glad I’d owned up, for Father slapped me on the back, and said I was a young brick, and our robber said I was no funk anyway, and though I got very hot under the blanket I liked it, and I explained that the others would have done the same if they had thought of it. Then Father got up some more beer, and laughed about Dora’s responsibility, and he got out a box of figs he had bought for us, only he hadn’t given it to us because of the Water Rates, and Eliza came in and brought up the bread and cheese, and what there was left of the neck of mutton, cold wreck of mutton, Father called it, and we had a feast, like a picnic, all sitting anywhere, and eating with our fingers. It was prime. We sat up till past twelve o’clock, and I never felt so pleased to think I was not born a girl. It was hard on the others; they would have done just the same if they’d thought of it. But it does make you feel jolly when your pater says you’re a young brick! When Mr Foulkes was going, he said to Alice, ‘Good-bye, Hardy.’ And Alice understood, of course, and kissed him as hard as she could. And she said, ‘I wanted to, when you said no one kissed you when you left off being a pirate.’ And he said, ‘I know you did, my dear.’ And Dora kissed him too, and said, ‘I suppose none of these tales were true?’ And our robber just said, ‘I tried to play the part properly, my dear.’ And he jolly well did play it, and no mistake. We have often seen him since, and his boy Denny, and his girl Daisy, but that comes in another story. And if any of you kids who read this ever had two such adventures in one night you can just write and tell me. That’s all. CHAPTER 14. THE DIVINING-ROD You have no idea how uncomfortable the house was on the day when we sought for gold with the divining-rod. It was like a spring-cleaning in the winter-time. All the carpets were up, because Father had told Eliza to make the place decent as there was a gentleman coming to dinner the next day. So she got in a charwoman, and they slopped water about, and left brooms and brushes on the stairs for people to tumble over. H. O. got a big bump on his head in that way, and when he said it was too bad, Eliza said he should keep in the nursery then, and not be where he’d no business. We bandaged his head with a towel, and then he stopped crying and played at being England’s wounded hero dying in the cockpit, while every man was doing his duty, as the hero had told them to, and Alice was Hardy, and I was the doctor, and the others were the crew. Playing at Hardy made us think of our own dear robber, and we wished he was there, and wondered if we should ever see him any more. We were rather astonished at Father’s having anyone to dinner, because now he never seems to think of anything but business. Before Mother died people often came to dinner, and Father’s business did not take up so much of his time and was not the bother it is now. And we used to see who could go furthest down in our nightgowns and get nice things to eat, without being seen, out of the dishes as they came out of the dining-room. Eliza can’t cook very nice things. She told Father she was a good plain cook, but he says it was a fancy portrait. We stayed in the nursery till the charwoman came in and told us to be off, she was going to make one job of it, and have our carpet up as well as all the others, now the man was here to beat them. It came up, and it was very dusty, and under it we found my threepenny-bit that I lost ages ago, which shows what Eliza is. H. O. had got tired of being the wounded hero, and Dicky was so tired of doing nothing that Dora said she knew he’d begin to tease Noel in a minute; then of course Dicky said he wasn’t going to tease anybody, he was going out to the Heath. He said he’d heard that nagging women drove a man from his home, and now he found it was quite true. Oswald always tries to be a peacemaker, so he told Dicky to shut up and not make an ass of himself. And Alice said, ‘Well, Dora began’, And Dora tossed her chin up and said it wasn’t any business of Oswald’s any way, and no one asked Alice’s opinion. So we all felt very uncomfortable till Noel said, ‘Don’t let’s quarrel about nothing. You know let dogs delight, and I made up another piece while you were talking,      Quarrelling is an evil thing,     It fills with gall life’s cup;     For when once you begin     It takes such a long time to make it up.’ We all laughed then and stopped jawing at each other. Noel is very funny with his poetry. But that piece happened to come out quite true. You begin to quarrel and then you can’t stop; often, long before the others are ready to cry and make it up, I see how silly it is, and I want to laugh; but it doesn’t do to say so, for it only makes the others crosser than they were before. I wonder why that is? Alice said Noel ought to be poet laureate, and she actually went out in the cold and got some laurel leaves, the spotted kind, out of the garden, and Dora made a crown and we put it on him. He was quite pleased; but the leaves made a mess, and Eliza said, ‘Don’t.’ I believe that’s a word grown-ups use more than any other. Then suddenly Alice thought of that old idea of hers for finding treasure, and she said, ‘Do let’s try the divining-rod.’ So Oswald said, ‘Fair priestess, we do greatly desire to find gold beneath our land, therefore we pray thee practise with the divining-rod, and tell us where we can find it.’ ‘Do ye desire to fashion of it helms and hauberks?’ said Alice. ‘Yes,’ said Noel; ‘and chains and ouches.’ ‘I bet you don’t know what an “ouch” is,’ said Dicky. ‘Yes I do, so there!’ said Noel. ‘It’s a carcanet. I looked it out in the dicker, now then!’ We asked him what a carcanet was, but he wouldn’t say. ‘And we want to make fair goblets of the gold,’ said Oswald. ‘Yes, to drink coconut milk out of,’ said H. O. ‘And we desire to build fair palaces of it,’ said Dicky. ‘And to buy things,’ said Dora; ‘a great many things. New Sunday frocks and hats and kid gloves and, ’ She would have gone on for ever so long only we reminded her that we hadn’t found the gold yet. By this Alice had put on the nursery tablecloth, which is green, and tied the old blue and yellow antimacassar over her head, and she said,  ‘If your intentions are correct, fear nothing and follow me.’ And she went down into the hall. We all followed chanting ‘Heroes.’ It is a gloomy thing the girls learnt at the High School, and we always use it when we want a priestly chant. Alice stopped short by the hat-stand, and held up her hands as well as she could for the tablecloth, and said,  ‘Now, great altar of the golden idol, yield me the divining-rod that I may use it for the good of the suffering people.’ The umbrella-stand was the altar of the golden idol, and it yielded her the old school umbrella. She carried it between her palms. ‘Now,’ she said, ‘I shall sing the magic chant. You mustn’t say anything, but just follow wherever I go, like follow my leader, you know, and when there is gold underneath the magic rod will twist in the hand of the priestess like a live thing that seeks to be free. Then you will dig, and the golden treasure will be revealed. H. O., if you make that clatter with your boots they’ll come and tell us not to. Now come on all of you.’ So she went upstairs and down and into every room. We followed her on tiptoe, and Alice sang as she went. What she sang is not out of a book, Noel made it up while she was dressing up for the priestess.     Ashen rod cold     That here I hold,     Teach me where to find the gold. When we came to where Eliza was, she said, ‘Get along with you’; but Dora said it was only a game, and we wouldn’t touch anything, and our boots were quite clean, and Eliza might as well let us. So she did. It was all right for the priestess, but it was a little dull for the rest of us, because she wouldn’t let us sing, too; so we said we’d had enough of it, and if she couldn’t find the gold we’d leave off and play something else. The priestess said, ‘All right, wait a minute,’ and went on singing. Then we all followed her back into the nursery, where the carpet was up and the boards smelt of soft soap. Then she said, ‘It moves, it moves! Once more the choral hymn!’ So we sang ‘Heroes’ again, and in the middle the umbrella dropped from her hands. ‘The magic rod has spoken,’ said Alice; ‘dig here, and that with courage and despatch.’ We didn’t quite see how to dig, but we all began to scratch on the floor with our hands, but the priestess said, ‘Don’t be so silly! It’s the place where they come to do the gas. The board’s loose. Dig an you value your lives, for ere sundown the dragon who guards this spoil will return in his fiery fury and make you his unresisting prey.’ So we dug, that is, we got the loose board up. And Alice threw up her arms and cried,  ‘See the rich treasure, the gold in thick layers, with silver and diamonds stuck in it!’ ‘Like currants in cake,’ said H. O. ‘It’s a lovely treasure,’ said Dicky yawning. ‘Let’s come back and carry it away another day.’ But Alice was kneeling by the hole. ‘Let me feast my eyes on the golden splendour,’ she said, ‘hidden these long centuries from the human eye. Behold how the magic rod has led us to treasures more, Oswald, don’t push so!, more bright than ever monarch, I say, there  is  something down there, really. I saw it shine!’ We thought she was kidding, but when she began to try to get into the hole, which was much too small, we saw she meant it, so I said, ‘Let’s have a squint,’ and I looked, but I couldn’t see anything, even when I lay down on my stomach. The others lay down on their stomachs too and tried to see, all but Noel, who stood and looked at us and said we were the great serpents come down to drink at the magic pool. He wanted to be the knight and slay the great serpents with his good sword, he even drew the umbrella ready, but Alice said, ‘All right, we will in a minute. But now, I’m sure I saw it; do get a match, Noel, there’s a dear.’ ‘What did you see?’ asked Noel, beginning to go for the matches very slowly. ‘Something bright, away in the corner under the board against the beam.’ ‘Perhaps it was a rat’s eye,’ Noel said, ‘or a snake’s,’ and we did not put our heads quite so close to the hole till he came back with the matches. Then I struck a match, and Alice cried, ‘There it is!’ And there it was, and it was a half-sovereign, partly dusty and partly bright. We think perhaps a mouse, disturbed by the carpets being taken up, may have brushed the dust of years from part of the half-sovereign with his tail. We can’t imagine how it came there, only Dora thinks she remembers once when H. O. was very little Mother gave him some money to hold, and he dropped it, and it rolled all over the floor. So we think perhaps this was part of it. We were very glad. H. O. wanted to go out at once and buy a mask he had seen for fourpence. It had been a shilling mask, but now it was going very cheap because Guy Fawkes’ Day was over, and it was a little cracked at the top. But Dora said, ‘I don’t know that it’s our money. Let’s wait and ask Father.’ But H. O. did not care about waiting, and I felt for him. Dora is rather like grown-ups in that way; she does not seem to understand that when you want a thing you do want it, and that you don’t wish to wait, even a minute. So we went and asked Albert-next-door’s uncle. He was pegging away at one of the rotten novels he has to write to make his living, but he said we weren’t interrupting him at all. ‘My hero’s folly has involved him in a difficulty,’ he said. ‘It is his own fault. I will leave him to meditate on the incredible fatuity, the hare-brained recklessness, which have brought him to this pass. It will be a lesson to him. I, meantime, will give myself unreservedly to the pleasures of your conversation.’ That’s one thing I like Albert’s uncle for. He always talks like a book, and yet you can always understand what he means. I think he is more like us, inside of his mind, than most grown-up people are. He can pretend beautifully. I never met anyone else so good at it, except our robber, and we began it, with him. But it was Albert’s uncle who first taught us how to make people talk like books when you’re playing things, and he made us learn to tell a story straight from the beginning, not starting in the middle like most people do. So now Oswald remembered what he had been told, as he generally does, and began at the beginning, but when he came to where Alice said she was the priestess, Albert’s uncle said,  ‘Let the priestess herself set forth the tale in fitting speech.’ So Alice said, ‘O high priest of the great idol, the humblest of thy slaves took the school umbrella for a divining-rod, and sang the song of inver, what’s-it’s-name?’ ‘Invocation perhaps?’ said Albert’s uncle. ‘Yes; and then I went about and about and the others got tired, so the divining-rod fell on a certain spot, and I said, “Dig”, and we dug, it was where the loose board is for the gas men, and then there really and truly was a half-sovereign lying under the boards, and here it is.’ Albert’s uncle took it and looked at it. ‘The great high priest will bite it to see if it’s good,’ he said, and he did. ‘I congratulate you,’ he went on; ‘you are indeed among those favoured by the Immortals. First you find half-crowns in the garden, and now this. The high priest advises you to tell your Father, and ask if you may keep it. My hero has become penitent, but impatient. I must pull him out of this scrape. Ye have my leave to depart.’ Of course we know from Kipling that that means, ‘You’d better bunk, and be sharp about it,’ so we came away. I do like Albert’s uncle. I shall be like that when I’m a man. He gave us our Jungle books, and he is awfully clever, though he does have to write grown-up tales. We told Father about it that night. He was very kind. He said we might certainly have the half-sovereign, and he hoped we should enjoy ourselves with our treasure-trove. Then he said, ‘Your dear Mother’s Indian Uncle is coming to dinner here to-morrow night. So will you not drag the furniture about overhead, please, more than you’re absolutely obliged; and H. O. might wear slippers or something. I can always distinguish the note of H. O.’s boots.’ We said we would be very quiet, and Father went on,  ‘This Indian Uncle is not used to children, and he is coming to talk business with me. It is really important that he should be quiet. Do you think, Dora, that perhaps bed at six for H. O. and Noel, ’ But H. O. said, ‘Father, I really and truly won’t make a noise. I’ll stand on my head all the evening sooner than disturb the Indian Uncle with my boots.’ And Alice said Noel never made a row anyhow. So Father laughed and said, ‘All right.’ And he said we might do as we liked with the half-sovereign. ‘Only for goodness’ sake don’t try to go in for business with it,’ he said. ‘It’s always a mistake to go into business with an insufficient capital.’ We talked it over all that evening, and we decided that as we were not to go into business with our half-sovereign it was no use not spending it at once, and so we might as well have a right royal feast. The next day we went out and bought the things. We got figs, and almonds and raisins, and a real raw rabbit, and Eliza promised to cook it for us if we would wait till tomorrow, because of the Indian Uncle coming to dinner. She was very busy cooking nice things for him to eat. We got the rabbit because we are so tired of beef and mutton, and Father hasn’t a bill at the poultry shop. And we got some flowers to go on the dinner-table for Father’s party. And we got hardbake and raspberry noyau and peppermint rock and oranges and a coconut, with other nice things. We put it all in the top long drawer. It is H. O.’s play drawer, and we made him turn his things out and put them in Father’s old portmanteau. H. O. is getting old enough now to learn to be unselfish, and besides, his drawer wanted tidying very badly. Then we all vowed by the honour of the ancient House of Bastable that we would not touch any of the feast till Dora gave the word next day. And we gave H. O. some of the hardbake, to make it easier for him to keep his vow. The next day was the most rememorable day in all our lives, but we didn’t know that then. But that is another story. I think that is such a useful way to know when you can’t think how to end up a chapter. I learnt it from another writer named Kipling. I’ve mentioned him before, I believe, but he deserves it! CHAPTER 15. ‘LO, THE POOR INDIAN!’ It was all very well for Father to ask us not to make a row because the Indian Uncle was coming to talk business, but my young brother’s boots are not the only things that make a noise. We took his boots away and made him wear Dora’s bath slippers, which are soft and woolly, and hardly any soles to them; and of course we wanted to see the Uncle, so we looked over the banisters when he came, and we were as quiet as mice, but when Eliza had let him in she went straight down to the kitchen and made the most awful row you ever heard, it sounded like the Day of judgement, or all the saucepans and crockery in the house being kicked about the floor, but she told me afterwards it was only the tea-tray and one or two cups and saucers, that she had knocked over in her flurry. We heard the Uncle say, ‘God bless my soul!’ and then he went into Father’s study and the door was shut, we didn’t see him properly at all that time. I don’t believe the dinner was very nice. Something got burned I’m sure, for we smelt it. It was an extra smell, besides the mutton. I know that got burned. Eliza wouldn’t have any of us in the kitchen except Dora, till dinner was over. Then we got what was left of the dessert, and had it on the stairs, just round the corner where they can’t see you from the hall, unless the first landing gas is lighted. Suddenly the study door opened and the Uncle came out and went and felt in his greatcoat pocket. It was his cigar-case he wanted. We saw that afterwards. We got a much better view of him then. He didn’t look like an Indian but just like a kind of brown, big Englishman, and of course he didn’t see us, but we heard him mutter to himself,  ‘Shocking bad dinner! Eh!, what?’ When he went back to the study he didn’t shut the door properly. That door has always been a little tiresome since the day we took the lock off to get out the pencil sharpener H. O. had shoved into the keyhole. We didn’t listen, really and truly, but the Indian Uncle has a very big voice, and Father was not going to be beaten by a poor Indian in talking or anything else, so he spoke up too, like a man, and I heard him say it was a very good business, and only wanted a little capital, and he said it as if it was an imposition he had learned, and he hated having to say it. The Uncle said, ‘Pooh, pooh!’ to that, and then he said he was afraid that what that same business wanted was not capital but management. Then I heard my Father say, ‘It is not a pleasant subject: I am sorry I introduced it. Suppose we change it, sir. Let me fill your glass.’ Then the poor Indian said something about vintage, and that a poor, broken-down man like he was couldn’t be too careful. And then Father said, ‘Well, whisky then,’ and afterwards they talked about Native Races and Imperial something or other and it got very dull. So then Oswald remembered that you must not hear what people do not intend you to hear, even if you are not listening and he said, ‘We ought not to stay here any longer. Perhaps they would not like us to hear, ’ Alice said, ‘Oh, do you think it could possibly matter?’ and went and shut the study door softly but quite tight. So it was no use staying there any longer, and we went to the nursery. Then Noel said, ‘Now I understand. Of course my Father is making a banquet for the Indian, because he is a poor, broken-down man. We might have known that from “Lo, the poor Indian!” you know.’ We all agreed with him, and we were glad to have the thing explained, because we had not understood before what Father wanted to have people to dinner for, and not let us come in. ‘Poor people are very proud,’ said Alice, ‘and I expect Father thought the Indian would be ashamed, if all of us children knew how poor he was.’ Then Dora said, ‘Poverty is no disgrace. We should honour honest Poverty.’ And we all agreed that that was so. ‘I wish his dinner had not been so nasty,’ Dora said, while Oswald put lumps of coal on the fire with his fingers, so as not to make a noise. He is a very thoughtful boy, and he did not wipe his fingers on his trouser leg as perhaps Noel or H. O. would have done, but he just rubbed them on Dora’s handkerchief while she was talking. ‘I am afraid the dinner was horrid.’ Dora went on. ‘The table looked very nice with the flowers we got. I set it myself, and Eliza made me borrow the silver spoons and forks from Albert-next-door’s Mother.’ ‘I hope the poor Indian is honest,’ said Dicky gloomily, ‘when you are a poor, broken-down man silver spoons must be a great temptation.’ Oswald told him not to talk such tommy-rot because the Indian was a relation, so of course he couldn’t do anything dishonourable. And Dora said it was all right any way, because she had washed up the spoons and forks herself and counted them, and they were all there, and she had put them into their wash-leather bag, and taken them back to Albert-next-door’s Mother. ‘And the brussels sprouts were all wet and swimmy,’ she went on, ‘and the potatoes looked grey, and there were bits of black in the gravy, and the mutton was bluey-red and soft in the middle. I saw it when it came out. The apple-pie looked very nice, but it wasn’t quite done in the apply part. The other thing that was burnt, you must have smelt it, was the soup.’ ‘It is a pity,’ said Oswald; ‘I don’t suppose he gets a good dinner every day.’ ‘No more do we,’ said H. O., ‘but we shall to-morrow.’ I thought of all the things we had bought with our half-sovereign, the rabbit and the sweets and the almonds and raisins and figs and the coconut: and I thought of the nasty mutton and things, and while I was thinking about it all Alice said,  ‘Let’s ask the poor Indian to come to dinner with  us  to-morrow.’ I should have said it myself if she had given me time. We got the little ones to go to bed by promising to put a note on their dressing-table saying what had happened, so that they might know the first thing in the morning, or in the middle of the night if they happened to wake up, and then we elders arranged everything. I waited by the back door, and when the Uncle was beginning to go Dicky was to drop a marble down between the banisters for a signal, so that I could run round and meet the Uncle as he came out. This seems like deceit, but if you are a thoughtful and considerate boy you will understand that we could not go down and say to the Uncle in the hall under Father’s eye, ‘Father has given you a beastly, nasty dinner, but if you will come to dinner with us tomorrow, we will show you our idea of good things to eat.’ You will see, if you think it over, that this would not have been at all polite to Father. So when the Uncle left, Father saw him to the door and let him out, and then went back to the study, looking very sad, Dora says. As the poor Indian came down our steps he saw me there at the gate. I did not mind his being poor, and I said, ‘Good evening, Uncle,’ just as politely as though he had been about to ascend into one of the gilded chariots of the rich and affluent, instead of having to walk to the station a quarter of a mile in the mud, unless he had the money for a tram fare. ‘Good evening, Uncle.’ I said it again, for he stood staring at me. I don’t suppose he was used to politeness from boys, some boys are anything but, especially to the Aged Poor. So I said, ‘Good evening, Uncle,’ yet once again. Then he said,  ‘Time you were in bed, young man. Eh!, what?’ Then I saw I must speak plainly with him, man to man. So I did. I said,  ‘You’ve been dining with my Father, and we couldn’t help hearing you say the dinner was shocking. So we thought as you’re an Indian, perhaps you’re very poor’, I didn’t like to tell him we had heard the dreadful truth from his own lips, so I went on, ‘because of “Lo, the poor Indian”, you know, and you can’t get a good dinner every day. And we are very sorry if you’re poor; and won’t you come and have dinner with us to-morrow, with us children, I mean? It’s a very, very good dinner, rabbit, and hardbake, and coconut, and you needn’t mind us knowing you’re poor, because we know honourable poverty is no disgrace, and, ’ I could have gone on much longer, but he interrupted me to say, ‘Upon my word! And what’s your name, eh?’ ‘Oswald Bastable,’ I said; and I do hope you people who are reading this story have not guessed before that I was Oswald all the time. ‘Oswald Bastable, eh? Bless my soul!’ said the poor Indian. ‘Yes, I’ll dine with you, Mr Oswald Bastable, with all the pleasure in life. Very kind and cordial invitation, I’m sure. Good night, sir. At one o’clock, I presume?’ ‘Yes, at one,’ I said. ‘Good night, sir.’ Then I went in and told the others, and we wrote a paper and put it on the boy’s dressing-table, and it said,  ‘The poor Indian is coming at one. He seemed very grateful to me for my kindness.’ We did not tell Father that the Uncle was coming to dinner with us, for the polite reason that I have explained before. But we had to tell Eliza; so we said a friend was coming to dinner and we wanted everything very nice. I think she thought it was Albert-next-door, but she was in a good temper that day, and she agreed to cook the rabbit and to make a pudding with currants in it. And when one o’clock came the Indian Uncle came too. I let him in and helped him off with his greatcoat, which was all furry inside, and took him straight to the nursery. We were to have dinner there as usual, for we had decided from the first that he would enjoy himself more if he was not made a stranger of. We agreed to treat him as one of ourselves, because if we were too polite, he might think it was our pride because he was poor. He shook hands with us all and asked our ages, and what schools we went to, and shook his head when we said we were having a holiday just now. I felt rather uncomfortable, I always do when they talk about schools, and I couldn’t think of anything to say to show him we meant to treat him as one of ourselves. I did ask if he played cricket. He said he had not played lately. And then no one said anything till dinner came in. We had all washed our faces and hands and brushed our hair before he came in, and we all looked very nice, especially Oswald, who had had his hair cut that very morning. When Eliza had brought in the rabbit and gone out again, we looked at each other in silent despair, like in books. It seemed as if it were going to be just a dull dinner like the one the poor Indian had had the night before; only, of course, the things to eat would be nicer. Dicky kicked Oswald under the table to make him say something, and he had his new boots on, too!, but Oswald did not kick back; then the Uncle asked,  ‘Do you carve, sir, or shall I?’ Suddenly Alice said,  ‘Would you like grown-up dinner, Uncle, or play-dinner?’ He did not hesitate a moment, but said, ‘Play-dinner, by all means. Eh!, what?’ and then we knew it was all right. So we at once showed the Uncle how to be a dauntless hunter. The rabbit was the deer we had slain in the green forest with our trusty yew bows, and we toasted the joints of it, when the Uncle had carved it, on bits of firewood sharpened to a point. The Uncle’s piece got a little burnt, but he said it was delicious, and he said game was always nicer when you had killed it yourself. When Eliza had taken away the rabbit bones and brought in the pudding, we waited till she had gone out and shut the door, and then we put the dish down on the floor and slew the pudding in the dish in the good old-fashioned way. It was a wild boar at bay, and very hard indeed to kill, even with forks. The Uncle was very fierce indeed with the pudding, and jumped and howled when he speared it, but when it came to his turn to be helped, he said, ‘No, thank you; think of my liver. Eh!, what?’ But he had some almonds and raisins, when we had climbed to the top of the chest of drawers to pluck them from the boughs of the great trees; and he had a fig from the cargo that the rich merchants brought in their ship, the long drawer was the ship, and the rest of us had the sweets and the coconut. It was a very glorious and beautiful feast, and when it was over we said we hoped it was better than the dinner last night. And he said: ‘I never enjoyed a dinner more.’ He was too polite to say what he really thought about Father’s dinner. And we saw that though he might be poor, he was a true gentleman. He smoked a cigar while we finished up what there was left to eat, and told us about tiger shooting and about elephants. We asked him about wigwams, and wampum, and mocassins, and beavers, but he did not seem to know, or else he was shy about talking of the wonders of his native land. We liked him very much indeed, and when he was going at last, Alice nudged me, and I said, ‘There’s one and threepence farthing left out of our half-sovereign. Will you take it, please, because we do like you very much indeed, and we don’t want it, really; and we would rather you had it.’ And I put the money into his hand. ‘I’ll take the threepenny-bit,’ he said, turning the money over and looking at it, ‘but I couldn’t rob you of the rest. By the way, where did you get the money for this most royal spread, half a sovereign you said, eh, what?’ We told him all about the different ways we had looked for treasure, and when we had been telling some time he sat down, to listen better and at last we told him how Alice had played at divining-rod, and how it really had found a half-sovereign. Then he said he would like to see her do it again. But we explained that the rod would only show gold and silver, and that we were quite sure there was no more gold in the house, because we happened to have looked very carefully. ‘Well, silver, then,’ said he; ‘let’s hide the plate-basket, and little Alice shall make the divining-rod find it. Eh!, what?’ ‘There isn’t any silver in the plate-basket now,’ Dora said. ‘Eliza asked me to borrow the silver spoons and forks for your dinner last night from Albert-next-door’s Mother. Father never notices, but she thought it would be nicer for you. Our own silver went to have the dents taken out; and I don’t think Father could afford to pay the man for doing it, for the silver hasn’t come back.’ ‘Bless my soul!’ said the Uncle again, looking at the hole in the big chair that we burnt when we had Guy Fawkes’ Day indoors. ‘And how much pocket-money do you get? Eh!, what?’ ‘We don’t have any now,’ said Alice; ‘but indeed we don’t want the other shilling. We’d much rather you had it, wouldn’t we?’ And the rest of us said, ‘Yes.’ The Uncle wouldn’t take it, but he asked a lot of questions, and at last he went away. And when he went he said,  ‘Well, youngsters, I’ve enjoyed myself very much. I shan’t forget your kind hospitality. Perhaps the poor Indian may be in a position to ask you all to dinner some day.’ Oswald said if he ever could we should like to come very much, but he was not to trouble to get such a nice dinner as ours, because we could do very well with cold mutton and rice pudding. We do not like these things, but Oswald knows how to behave. Then the poor Indian went away. We had not got any treasure by this party, but we had had a very good time, and I am sure the Uncle enjoyed himself. We were so sorry he was gone that we could none of us eat much tea; but we did not mind, because we had pleased the poor Indian and enjoyed ourselves too. Besides, as Dora said, ‘A contented mind is a continual feast,’ so it did not matter about not wanting tea. Only H. O. did not seem to think a continual feast was a contented mind, and Eliza gave him a powder in what was left of the red-currant jelly Father had for the nasty dinner. But the rest of us were quite well, and I think it must have been the coconut with H. O. We hoped nothing had disagreed with the Uncle, but we never knew. CHAPTER 16. THE END OF THE TREASURE-SEEKING Now it is coming near the end of our treasure-seeking, and the end was so wonderful that now nothing is like it used to be. It is like as if our fortunes had been in an earthquake, and after those, you know, everything comes out wrong-way up. The day after the Uncle speared the pudding with us opened in gloom and sadness. But you never know. It was destined to be a day when things happened. Yet no sign of this appeared in the early morning. Then all was misery and upsetness. None of us felt quite well; I don’t know why: and Father had one of his awful colds, so Dora persuaded him not to go to London, but to stay cosy and warm in the study, and she made him some gruel. She makes it better than Eliza does; Eliza’s gruel is all little lumps, and when you suck them it is dry oatmeal inside. We kept as quiet as we could, and I made H. O. do some lessons, like the G. B. had advised us to. But it was very dull. There are some days when you seem to have got to the end of all the things that could ever possibly happen to you, and you feel you will spend all the rest of your life doing dull things just the same way. Days like this are generally wet days. But, as I said, you never know. Then Dicky said if things went on like this he should run away to sea, and Alice said she thought it would be rather nice to go into a convent. H. O. was a little disagreeable because of the powder Eliza had given him, so he tried to read two books at once, one with each eye, just because Noel wanted one of the books, which was very selfish of him, so it only made his headache worse. H. O. is getting old enough to learn by experience that it is wrong to be selfish, and when he complained about his head Oswald told him whose fault it was, because I am older than he is, and it is my duty to show him where he is wrong. But he began to cry, and then Oswald had to cheer him up because of Father wanting to be quiet. So Oswald said,  ‘They’ll eat H. O. if you don’t look out!’ And Dora said Oswald was too bad. Of course Oswald was not going to interfere again, so he went to look out of the window and see the trams go by, and by and by H. O. came and looked out too, and Oswald, who knows when to be generous and forgiving, gave him a piece of blue pencil and two nibs, as good as new, to keep. As they were looking out at the rain splashing on the stones in the street they saw a four-wheeled cab come lumbering up from the way the station is. Oswald called out,  ‘Here comes the coach of the Fairy Godmother. It’ll stop here, you see if it doesn’t!’ So they all came to the window to look. Oswald had only said that about stopping and he was stricken with wonder and amaze when the cab really did stop. It had boxes on the top and knobby parcels sticking out of the window, and it was something like going away to the seaside and something like the gentleman who takes things about in a carriage with the wooden shutters up, to sell to the drapers’ shops. The cabman got down, and some one inside handed out ever so many parcels of different shapes and sizes, and the cabman stood holding them in his arms and grinning over them. Dora said, ‘It is a pity some one doesn’t tell him this isn’t the house.’ And then from inside the cab some one put out a foot feeling for the step, like a tortoise’s foot coming out from under his shell when you are holding him off the ground, and then a leg came and more parcels, and then Noel cried,  ‘It’s the poor Indian!’ And it was. Eliza opened the door, and we were all leaning over the banisters. Father heard the noise of parcels and boxes in the hall, and he came out without remembering how bad his cold was. If you do that yourself when you have a cold they call you careless and naughty. Then we heard the poor Indian say to Father,  ‘I say, Dick, I dined with your kids yesterday, as I daresay they’ve told you. Jolliest little cubs I ever saw! Why didn’t you let me see them the other night? The eldest is the image of poor Janey, and as to young Oswald, he’s a man! If he’s not a man, I’m a nigger! Eh!, what? And Dick, I say, I shouldn’t wonder if I could find a friend to put a bit into that business of yours, eh?’ Then he and Father went into the study and the door was shut, and we went down and looked at the parcels. Some were done up in old, dirty newspapers, and tied with bits of rag, and some were in brown paper and string from the shops, and there were boxes. We wondered if the Uncle had come to stay and this was his luggage, or whether it was to sell. Some of it smelt of spices, like merchandise, and one bundle Alice felt certain was a bale. We heard a hand on the knob of the study door after a bit, and Alice said,  ‘Fly!’ and we all got away but H. O., and the Uncle caught him by the leg as he was trying to get upstairs after us. ‘Peeping at the baggage, eh?’ said the Uncle, and the rest of us came down because it would have been dishonourable to leave H. O. alone in a scrape, and we wanted to see what was in the parcels. ‘I didn’t touch,’ said H. O. ‘Are you coming to stay? I hope you are.’ ‘No harm done if you did touch,’ said the good, kind, Indian man to all of us. ‘For all these parcels are  for you .’ I have several times told you about our being dumb with amazement and terror and joy, and things like that, but I never remember us being dumber than we were when he said this. The Indian Uncle went on: ‘I told an old friend of mine what a pleasant dinner I had with you, and about the threepenny-bit, and the divining-rod, and all that, and he sent all these odds and ends as presents for you. Some of the things came from India.’ ‘Have you come from India, Uncle?’ Noel asked; and when he said ‘Yes’ we were all very much surprised, for we never thought of his being that sort of Indian. We thought he was the Red kind, and of course his not being accounted for his ignorance of beavers and things. He got Eliza to help, and we took all the parcels into the nursery and he undid them and undid them and undid them, till the papers lay thick on the floor. Father came too and sat in the Guy Fawkes chair. I cannot begin to tell you all the things that kind friend of Uncle’s had sent us. He must be a very agreeable person. There were toys for the kids and model engines for Dick and me, and a lot of books, and Japanese china tea-sets for the girls, red and white and gold, there were sweets by the pound and by the box, and long yards and yards of soft silk from India, to make frocks for the girls, and a real Indian sword for Oswald and a book of Japanese pictures for Noel, and some ivory chess men for Dicky: the castles of the chessmen are elephant-and-castles. There is a railway station called that; I never knew what it meant before. The brown paper and string parcels had boxes of games in them, and big cases of preserved fruits and things. And the shabby old newspaper parcels and the boxes had the Indian things in. I never saw so many beautiful things before. There were carved fans and silver bangles and strings of amber beads, and necklaces of uncut gems, turquoises and garnets, the Uncle said they were, and shawls and scarves of silk, and cabinets of brown and gold, and ivory boxes and silver trays, and brass things. The Uncle kept saying, ‘This is for you, young man,’ or ‘Little Alice will like this fan,’ or ‘Miss Dora would look well in this green silk, I think. Eh!, what?’ And Father looked on as if it was a dream, till the Uncle suddenly gave him an ivory paper-knife and a box of cigars, and said, ‘My old friend sent you these, Dick; he’s an old friend of yours too, he says.’ And he winked at my Father, for H. O. and I saw him. And my Father winked back, though he has always told us not to. That was a wonderful day. It was a treasure, and no mistake! I never saw such heaps and heaps of presents, like things out of a fairy-tale, and even Eliza had a shawl. Perhaps she deserved it, for she did cook the rabbit and the pudding; and Oswald says it is not her fault if her nose turns up and she does not brush her hair. I do not think Eliza likes brushing things. It is the same with the carpets. But Oswald tries to make allowances even for people who do not wash their ears. The Indian Uncle came to see us often after that, and his friend always sent us something. Once he tipped us a sovereign each, the Uncle brought it; and once he sent us money to go to the Crystal Palace, and the Uncle took us; and another time to a circus; and when Christmas was near the Uncle said,  ‘You remember when I dined with you, some time ago, you promised to dine with me some day, if I could ever afford to give a dinner-party. Well, I’m going to have one, a Christmas party. Not on Christmas Day, because every one goes home then, but on the day after. Cold mutton and rice pudding. You’ll come? Eh!, what?’ We said we should be delighted, if Father had no objection, because that is the proper thing to say, and the poor Indian, I mean the Uncle, said, ‘No, your Father won’t object, he’s coming too, bless your soul!’ We all got Christmas presents for the Uncle. The girls made him a handkerchief case and a comb bag, out of some of the pieces of silk he had given them. I got him a knife with three blades; H. O. got a siren whistle, a very strong one, and Dicky joined with me in the knife, and Noel would give the Indian ivory box that Uncle’s friend had sent on the wonderful Fairy Cab day. He said it was the very nicest thing he had, and he was sure Uncle wouldn’t mind his not having bought it with his own money. I think Father’s business must have got better, perhaps Uncle’s friend put money in it and that did it good, like feeding the starving. Anyway we all had new suits, and the girls had the green silk from India made into frocks, and on Boxing Day we went in two cabs, Father and the girls in one, and us boys in the other. We wondered very much where the Indian Uncle lived, because we had not been told. And we thought when the cab began to go up the hill towards the Heath that perhaps the Uncle lived in one of the poky little houses up at the top of Greenwich. But the cab went right over the Heath and in at some big gates, and through a shrubbery all white with frost like a fairy forest, because it was Christmas time. And at last we stopped before one of those jolly, big, ugly red houses with a lot of windows, that are so comfortable inside, and on the steps was the Indian Uncle, looking very big and grand, in a blue cloth coat and yellow sealskin waistcoat, with a bunch of seals hanging from it. ‘I wonder whether he has taken a place as butler here?’ said Dicky. ‘A poor, broken-down man, ’ Noel thought it was very likely, because he knew that in these big houses there were always thousands of stately butlers. The Uncle came down the steps and opened the cab door himself, which I don’t think butlers would expect to have to do. And he took us in. It was a lovely hall, with bear and tiger skins on the floor, and a big clock with the faces of the sun and moon dodging out when it was day or night, and Father Time with a scythe coming out at the hours, and the name on it was ‘Flint. Ashford. 1776’; and there was a fox eating a stuffed duck in a glass case, and horns of stags and other animals over the doors. ‘We’ll just come into my study first,’ said the Uncle, ‘and wish each other a Merry Christmas.’ So then we knew he wasn’t the butler, but it must be his own house, for only the master of the house has a study. His study was not much like Father’s. It had hardly any books, but swords and guns and newspapers and a great many boots, and boxes half unpacked, with more Indian things bulging out of them. We gave him our presents and he was awfully pleased. Then he gave us his Christmas presents. You must be tired of hearing about presents, but I must remark that all the Uncle’s presents were watches; there was a watch for each of us, with our names engraved inside, all silver except H. O.’s, and that was a Waterbury, ‘To match his boots,’ the Uncle said. I don’t know what he meant. Then the Uncle looked at Father, and Father said, ‘You tell them, sir.’ So the Uncle coughed and stood up and made a speech. He said,  ‘Ladies and gentlemen, we are met together to discuss an important subject which has for some weeks engrossed the attention of the honourable member opposite and myself.’ I said, ‘Hear, hear,’ and Alice whispered, ‘What happened to the guinea-pig?’ Of course you know the answer to that. The Uncle went on,  ‘I am going to live in this house, and as it’s rather big for me, your Father has agreed that he and you shall come and live with me. And so, if you’re agreeable, we’re all going to live here together, and, please God, it’ll be a happy home for us all. Eh!, what?’ He blew his nose and kissed us all round. As it was Christmas I did not mind, though I am much too old for it on other dates. Then he said, ‘Thank you all very much for your presents; but I’ve got a present here I value more than anything else I have.’ I thought it was not quite polite of him to say so, till I saw that what he valued so much was a threepenny-bit on his watch-chain, and, of course, I saw it must be the one we had given him. He said, ‘You children gave me that when you thought I was the poor Indian, and I’ll keep it as long as I live. And I’ve asked some friends to help us to be jolly, for this is our house-warming. Eh!, what?’ Then he shook Father by the hand, and they blew their noses; and then Father said, ‘Your Uncle has been most kind, most, ’ But Uncle interrupted by saying, ‘Now, Dick, no nonsense!’ Then H. O. said, ‘Then you’re not poor at all?’ as if he were very disappointed. The Uncle replied, ‘I have enough for my simple wants, thank you, H. O.; and your Father’s business will provide him with enough for yours. Eh!, what?’ Then we all went down and looked at the fox thoroughly, and made the Uncle take the glass off so that we could see it all round and then the Uncle took us all over the house, which is the most comfortable one I have ever been in. There is a beautiful portrait of Mother in Father’s sitting-room. The Uncle must be very rich indeed. This ending is like what happens in Dickens’s books; but I think it was much jollier to happen like a book, and it shows what a nice man the Uncle is, the way he did it all. Think how flat it would have been if the Uncle had said, when we first offered him the one and threepence farthing, ‘Oh, I don’t want your dirty one and three-pence! I’m very rich indeed.’ Instead of which he saved up the news of his wealth till Christmas, and then told us all in one glorious burst. Besides, I can’t help it if it is like Dickens, because it happens this way. Real life is often something like books. Presently, when we had seen the house, we were taken into the drawing-room, and there was Mrs Leslie, who gave us the shillings and wished us good hunting, and Lord Tottenham, and Albert-next-door’s Uncle, and Albert-next-door, and his Mother (I’m not very fond of her), and best of all our own Robber and his two kids, and our Robber had a new suit on. The Uncle told us he had asked the people who had been kind to us, and Noel said, ‘Where is my noble editor that I wrote the poetry to?’ The Uncle said he had not had the courage to ask a strange editor to dinner; but Lord Tottenham was an old friend of Uncle’s, and he had introduced Uncle to Mrs Leslie, and that was how he had the pride and pleasure of welcoming her to our house-warming. And he made her a bow like you see on a Christmas card. Then Alice asked, ‘What about Mr Rosenbaum? He was kind; it would have been a pleasant surprise for him.’ But everybody laughed, and Uncle said,  ‘Your father has paid him the sovereign he lent you. I don’t think he could have borne another pleasant surprise.’ And I said there was the butcher, and he was really kind; but they only laughed, and Father said you could not ask all your business friends to a private dinner. Then it was dinner-time, and we thought of Uncle’s talk about cold mutton and rice. But it was a beautiful dinner, and I never saw such a dessert! We had ours on plates to take away into another sitting-room, which was much jollier than sitting round the table with the grown-ups. But the Robber’s kids stayed with their Father. They were very shy and frightened, and said hardly anything, but looked all about with very bright eyes. H. O. thought they were like white mice; but afterwards we got to know them very well, and in the end they were not so mousy. And there is a good deal of interesting stuff to tell about them; but I shall put all that in another book, for there is no room for it in this one. We played desert islands all the afternoon and drank Uncle’s health in ginger wine. It was H. O. that upset his over Alice’s green silk dress, and she never even rowed him. Brothers ought not to have favourites, and Oswald would never be so mean as to have a favourite sister, or, if he had, wild horses should not make him tell who it was. And now we are to go on living in the big house on the Heath, and it is very jolly. Mrs Leslie often comes to see us, and our own Robber and Albert-next-door’s uncle. The Indian Uncle likes him because he has been in India too and is brown; but our Uncle does not like Albert-next-door. He says he is a muff. And I am to go to Rugby, and so are Noel and H. O., and perhaps to Balliol afterwards. Balliol is my Father’s college. It has two separate coats of arms, which many other colleges are not allowed. Noel is going to be a poet and Dicky wants to go into Father’s business. The Uncle is a real good old sort; and just think, we should never have found him if we hadn’t made up our minds to be Treasure Seekers! Noel made a poem about it,      Lo! the poor Indian from lands afar,     Comes where the treasure seekers are;     We looked for treasure, but we find     The best treasure of all is the Uncle good and kind. I thought it was rather rot, but Alice would show it to the Uncle, and he liked it very much. He kissed Alice and he smacked Noel on the back, and he said, ‘I don’t think I’ve done so badly either, if you come to that, though I was never a regular professional treasure seeker. Eh!, what?’ CHAPTER I. THE PSAMMEAD There were once four children who spent their summer holidays in a white house, happily situated between a sandpit and a chalkpit. One day they had the good fortune to find in the sandpit a strange creature. Its eyes were on long horns like snail’s eyes, and it could move them in and out like telescopes. It had ears like a bat’s ears, and its tubby body was shaped like a spider’s and covered with thick soft fur—and it had hands and feet like a monkey’s. It told the children—whose names were Cyril, Robert, Anthea, and Jane—that it was a Psammead or sand-fairy. (Psammead is pronounced Sammy-ad.) It was old, old, old, and its birthday was almost at the very beginning of everything. And it had been buried in the sand for thousands of years. But it still kept its fairylikeness, and part of this fairylikeness was its power to give people whatever they wished for. You know fairies have always been able to do this. Cyril, Robert, Anthea, and Jane now found their wishes come true; but, somehow, they never could think of just the right things to wish for, and their wishes sometimes turned out very oddly indeed. In the end their unwise wishings landed them in what Robert called “a very tight place indeed”, and the Psammead consented to help them out of it in return for their promise never never to ask it to grant them any more wishes, and never to tell anyone about it, because it did not want to be bothered to give wishes to anyone ever any more. At the moment of parting Jane said politely— “I wish we were going to see you again some day.” And the Psammead, touched by this friendly thought, granted the wish. The book about all this is called  Five Children and It , and it ends up in a most tiresome way by saying— “The children  did  see the Psammead again, but it was not in the sandpit; it was—but I must say no more—” The reason that nothing more could be said was that I had not then been able to find out exactly when and where the children met the Psammead again. Of course I knew they would meet it, because it was a beast of its word, and when it said a thing would happen, that thing happened without fail. How different from the people who tell us about what weather it is going to be on Thursday next, in London, the South Coast, and Channel! The summer holidays during which the Psammead had been found and the wishes given had been wonderful holidays in the country, and the children had the highest hopes of just such another holiday for the next summer. The winter holidays were beguiled by the wonderful happenings of  The Phœnix and the Carpet , and the loss of these two treasures would have left the children in despair, but for the splendid hope of their next holiday in the country. The world, they felt, and indeed had some reason to feel, was full of wonderful things—and they were really the sort of people that wonderful things happen to. So they looked forward to the summer holiday; but when it came everything was different, and very, very horrid. Father had to go out to Manchuria to telegraph news about the war to the tiresome paper he wrote for—the  Daily Bellower , or something like that, was its name. And Mother, poor dear Mother, was away in Madeira, because she had been very ill. And The Lamb—I mean the baby—was with her. And Aunt Emma, who was Mother’s sister, had suddenly married Uncle Reginald, who was Father’s brother, and they had gone to China, which is much too far off for you to expect to be asked to spend the holidays in, however fond your aunt and uncle may be of you. So the children were left in the care of old Nurse, who lived in Fitzroy Street, near the British Museum, and though she was always very kind to them, and indeed spoiled them far more than would be good for the most grown-up of us, the four children felt perfectly wretched, and when the cab had driven off with Father and all his boxes and guns and the sheepskin, with blankets and the aluminium mess-kit inside it, the stoutest heart quailed, and the girls broke down altogether, and sobbed in each other’s arms, while the boys each looked out of one of the long gloomy windows of the parlour, and tried to pretend that no boy would be such a muff as to cry. I hope you notice that they were not cowardly enough to cry till their Father had gone; they knew he had quite enough to upset him without that. But when he was gone everyone felt as if it had been trying not to cry all its life, and that it must cry now, if it died for it. So they cried. Tea—with shrimps and watercress—cheered them a little. The watercress was arranged in a hedge round a fat glass salt-cellar, a tasteful device they had never seen before. But it was not a cheerful meal. After tea Anthea went up to the room that had been Father’s, and when she saw how dreadfully he wasn’t there, and remembered how every minute was taking him further and further from her, and nearer and nearer to the guns of the Russians, she cried a little more. Then she thought of Mother, ill and alone, and perhaps at that very moment wanting a little girl to put eau-de-cologne on her head, and make her sudden cups of tea, and she cried more than ever. And then she remembered what Mother had said, the night before she went away, about Anthea being the eldest girl, and about trying to make the others happy, and things like that. So she stopped crying, and thought instead. And when she had thought as long as she could bear she washed her face and combed her hair, and went down to the others, trying her best to look as though crying were an exercise she had never even heard of. She found the parlour in deepest gloom, hardly relieved at all by the efforts of Robert, who, to make the time pass, was pulling Jane’s hair—not hard, but just enough to tease. “Look here,” said Anthea. “Let’s have a palaver.” This word dated from the awful day when Cyril had carelessly wished that there were Red Indians in England—and there had been. The word brought back memories of last summer holidays and everyone groaned; they thought of the white house with the beautiful tangled garden—late roses, asters, marigold, sweet mignonette, and feathery asparagus—of the wilderness which someone had once meant to make into an orchard, but which was now, as Father said, “five acres of thistles haunted by the ghosts of baby cherry-trees”. They thought of the view across the valley, where the lime-kilns looked like Aladdin’s palaces in the sunshine, and they thought of their own sandpit, with its fringe of yellowy grasses and pale-stringy-stalked wild flowers, and the little holes in the cliff that were the little sand-martins’ little front doors. And they thought of the free fresh air smelling of thyme and sweetbriar, and the scent of the wood-smoke from the cottages in the lane—and they looked round old Nurse’s stuffy parlour, and Jane said— “Oh, how different it all is!” It was. Old Nurse had been in the habit of letting lodgings, till Father gave her the children to take care of. And her rooms were furnished “for letting”. Now it is a very odd thing that no one ever seems to furnish a room “for letting” in a bit the same way as one would furnish it for living in. This room had heavy dark red stuff curtains—the colour that blood would not make a stain on—with coarse lace curtains inside. The carpet was yellow, and violet, with bits of grey and brown oilcloth in odd places. The fireplace had shavings and tinsel in it. There was a very varnished mahogany chiffonier, or sideboard, with a lock that wouldn’t act. There were hard chairs—far too many of them—with crochet antimacassars slipping off their seats, all of which sloped the wrong way. The table wore a cloth of a cruel green colour with a yellow chain-stitch pattern round it. Over the fireplace was a looking-glass that made you look much uglier than you really were, however plain you might be to begin with. Then there was a mantelboard with maroon plush and wool fringe that did not match the plush; a dreary clock like a black marble tomb—it was silent as the grave too, for it had long since forgotten how to tick. And there were painted glass vases that never had any flowers in, and a painted tambourine that no one ever played, and painted brackets with nothing on them. “And maple-framed engravings of the Queen, The Houses of Parliament, the Plains of Heaven, And of a blunt-nosed woodman’s flat return.” There were two books—last December’s  Bradshaw , and an odd volume of Plumridge’s  Commentary on Thessalonians . There were—but I cannot dwell longer on this painful picture. It was indeed, as Jane said, very different. “Let’s have a palaver,” said Anthea again. “What about?” said Cyril, yawning. “There’s nothing to have  anything  about,” said Robert kicking the leg of the table miserably. “I don’t want to play,” said Jane, and her tone was grumpy. Anthea tried very hard not to be cross. She succeeded. “Look here,” she said, “don’t think I want to be preachy or a beast in any way, but I want to what Father calls define the situation. Do you agree?” “Fire ahead,” said Cyril without enthusiasm. “Well then. We all know the reason we’re staying here is because Nurse couldn’t leave her house on account of the poor learned gentleman on the top-floor. And there was no one else Father could entrust to take care of us—and you know it’s taken a lot of money, Mother’s going to Madeira to be made well.” Jane sniffed miserably. “Yes, I know,” said Anthea in a hurry, “but don’t let’s think about how horrid it all is. I mean we can’t go to things that cost a lot, but we must do  something . And I know there are heaps of things you can see in London without paying for them, and I thought we’d go and see them. We are all quite old now, and we haven’t got The Lamb—” Jane sniffed harder than before. “I mean no one can say ‘No’ because of him, dear pet. And I thought we  must  get Nurse to see how quite old we are, and let us go out by ourselves, or else we shall never have any sort of a time at all. And I vote we see everything there is, and let’s begin by asking Nurse to give us some bits of bread and we’ll go to St James’s Park. There are ducks there, I know, we can feed them. Only we must make Nurse let us go by ourselves.” “Hurrah for liberty!” said Robert, “but she won’t.” “Yes she will,” said Jane unexpectedly. “ I  thought about that this morning, and I asked Father, and he said yes; and what’s more he told old Nurse we might, only he said we must always say where we wanted to go, and if it was right she would let us.” “Three cheers for thoughtful Jane,” cried Cyril, now roused at last from his yawning despair. “I say, let’s go now.” So they went, old Nurse only begging them to be careful of crossings, and to ask a policeman to assist in the more difficult cases. But they were used to crossings, for they had lived in Camden Town and knew the Kentish Town Road where the trams rush up and down like mad at all hours of the day and night, and seem as though, if anything, they would rather run over you than not. They had promised to be home by dark, but it was July, so dark would be very late indeed, and long past bedtime. They started to walk to St James’s Park, and all their pockets were stuffed with bits of bread and the crusts of toast, to feed the ducks with. They started, I repeat, but they never got there. Between Fitzroy Street and St James’s Park there are a great many streets, and, if you go the right way you will pass a great many shops that you cannot possibly help stopping to look at. The children stopped to look at several with gold-lace and beads and pictures and jewellery and dresses, and hats, and oysters and lobsters in their windows, and their sorrow did not seem nearly so impossible to bear as it had done in the best parlour at No. 300, Fitzroy Street. Presently, by some wonderful chance turn of Robert’s (who had been voted Captain because the girls thought it would be good for him—and indeed he thought so himself—and of course Cyril couldn’t vote against him because it would have looked like a mean jealousy), they came into the little interesting criss-crossy streets that held the most interesting shops of all—the shops where live things were sold. There was one shop window entirely filled with cages, and all sorts of beautiful birds in them. The children were delighted till they remembered how they had once wished for wings themselves, and had had them—and then they felt how desperately unhappy anything with wings must be if it is shut up in a cage and not allowed to fly. “It must be fairly beastly to be a bird in a cage,” said Cyril. “Come on!” They went on, and Cyril tried to think out a scheme for making his fortune as a gold-digger at Klondyke, and then buying all the caged birds in the world and setting them free. Then they came to a shop that sold cats, but the cats were in cages, and the children could not help wishing someone would buy all the cats and put them on hearthrugs, which are the proper places for cats. And there was the dog-shop, and that was not a happy thing to look at either, because all the dogs were chained or caged, and all the dogs, big and little, looked at the four children with sad wistful eyes and wagged beseeching tails as if they were trying to say, “Buy me! buy me! buy me! and let me go for a walk with you; oh, do buy me, and buy my poor brothers too! Do! do! do!” They almost said, “Do! do! do!” plain to the ear, as they whined; all but one big Irish terrier, and he growled when Jane patted him. “Grrrrr,” he seemed to say, as he looked at them from the back corner of his eye—“ You  won’t buy me. Nobody will—ever—I shall die chained up—and I don’t know that I care how soon it is, either!” I don’t know that the children would have understood all this, only once they had been in a besieged castle, so they knew how hateful it is to be kept in when you want to get out. Of course they could not buy any of the dogs. They did, indeed, ask the price of the very, very smallest, and it was sixty-five pounds—but that was because it was a Japanese toy spaniel like the Queen once had her portrait painted with, when she was only Princess of Wales. But the children thought, if the smallest was all that money, the biggest would run into thousands—so they went on. And they did not stop at any more cat or dog or bird shops, but passed them by, and at last they came to a shop that seemed as though it only sold creatures that did not much mind where they were—such as goldfish and white mice, and sea-anemones and other aquarium beasts, and lizards and toads, and hedgehogs and tortoises, and tame rabbits and guinea-pigs. And there they stopped for a long time, and fed the guinea-pigs with bits of bread through the cage-bars, and wondered whether it would be possible to keep a sandy-coloured double-lop in the basement of the house in Fitzroy Street. “I don’t suppose old Nurse would mind  very  much,” said Jane. “Rabbits are most awfully tame sometimes. I expect it would know her voice and follow her all about.” “She’d tumble over it twenty times a day,” said Cyril; “now a snake—” “There aren’t any snakes,” said Robert hastily, “and besides, I never could cotton to snakes somehow—I wonder why.” “Worms are as bad,” said Anthea, “and eels and slugs—I think it’s because we don’t like things that haven’t got legs.” “Father says snakes have got legs hidden away inside of them,” said Robert. “Yes—and he says  we’ve  got tails hidden away inside  us —but it doesn’t either of it come to anything  really ,” said Anthea. “I hate things that haven’t any legs.” “It’s worse when they have too many,” said Jane with a shudder, “think of centipedes!” They stood there on the pavement, a cause of some inconvenience to the passersby, and thus beguiled the time with conversation. Cyril was leaning his elbow on the top of a hutch that had seemed empty when they had inspected the whole edifice of hutches one by one, and he was trying to reawaken the interest of a hedgehog that had curled itself into a ball earlier in the interview, when a small, soft voice just below his elbow said, quietly, plainly and quite unmistakably—not in any squeak or whine that had to be translated—but in downright common English— “Buy me—do—please buy me!” Cyril started as though he had been pinched, and jumped a yard away from the hutch. “Come back—oh, come back!” said the voice, rather louder but still softly; “stoop down and pretend to be tying up your bootlace—I see it’s undone, as usual.” Cyril mechanically obeyed. He knelt on one knee on the dry, hot dusty pavement, peered into the darkness of the hutch and found himself face to face with—the Psammead! It seemed much thinner than when he had last seen it. It was dusty and dirty, and its fur was untidy and ragged. It had hunched itself up into a miserable lump, and its long snail’s eyes were drawn in quite tight so that they hardly showed at all. “Listen,” said the Psammead, in a voice that sounded as though it would begin to cry in a minute, “I don’t think the creature who keeps this shop will ask a very high price for me. I’ve bitten him more than once, and I’ve made myself look as common as I can. He’s never had a glance from my beautiful, beautiful eyes. Tell the others I’m here—but tell them to look at some of those low, common beasts while I’m talking to you. The creature inside mustn’t think you care much about me, or he’ll put a price upon me far, far beyond your means. I remember in the dear old days last summer you never had much money. Oh—I never thought I should be so glad to see you—I never did.” It sniffed, and shot out its long snail’s eyes expressly to drop a tear well away from its fur. “Tell the others I’m here, and then I’ll tell you exactly what to do about buying me.” Cyril tied his bootlace into a hard knot, stood up and addressed the others in firm tones— “Look here,” he said, “I’m not kidding—and I appeal to your honour,” an appeal which in this family was never made in vain. “Don’t look at that hutch—look at the white rat. Now you are not to look at that hutch whatever I say.” He stood in front of it to prevent mistakes. “Now get yourselves ready for a great surprise. In that hutch there’s an old friend of ours— don’t  look!—Yes; it’s the Psammead, the good old Psammead! it wants us to buy it. It says you’re not to look at it. Look at the white rat and count your money! On your honour don’t look!” The others responded nobly. They looked at the white rat till they quite stared him out of countenance, so that he went and sat up on his hind legs in a far corner and hid his eyes with his front paws, and pretended he was washing his face. Cyril stooped again, busying himself with the other bootlace and listened for the Psammead’s further instructions. “Go in,” said the Psammead, “and ask the price of lots of other things. Then say, ‘What do you want for that monkey that’s lost its tail—the mangy old thing in the third hutch from the end.’ Oh—don’t mind  my  feelings—call me a mangy monkey—I’ve tried hard enough to look like one! I don’t think he’ll put a high price on me—I’ve bitten him eleven times since I came here the day before yesterday. If he names a bigger price than you can afford, say you wish you had the money.” “But you can’t give us wishes. I’ve promised never to have another wish from you,” said the bewildered Cyril. “Don’t be a silly little idiot,” said the Sand-fairy in trembling but affectionate tones, “but find out how much money you’ve got between you, and do exactly what I tell you.” Cyril, pointing a stiff and unmeaning finger at the white rat, so as to pretend that its charms alone employed his tongue, explained matters to the others, while the Psammead hunched itself, and bunched itself, and did its very best to make itself look uninteresting. Then the four children filed into the shop. “How much do you want for that white rat?” asked Cyril. “Eightpence,” was the answer. “And the guinea-pigs?” “Eighteenpence to five bob, according to the breed.” “And the lizards?” “Ninepence each.” “And toads?” “Fourpence. Now look here,” said the greasy owner of all this caged life with a sudden ferocity which made the whole party back hurriedly on to the wainscoting of hutches with which the shop was lined. “Lookee here. I ain’t agoin’ to have you a comin’ in here a turnin’ the whole place outer winder, an’ prizing every animile in the stock just for your larks, so don’t think it! If you’re a buyer,  be  a buyer—but I never had a customer yet as wanted to buy mice, and lizards, and toads, and guineas all at once. So hout you goes.” “Oh! wait a minute,” said the wretched Cyril, feeling how foolishly yet well-meaningly he had carried out the Psammead’s instructions. “Just tell me one thing. What do you want for the mangy old monkey in the third hutch from the end?” The shopman only saw in this a new insult. “Mangy young monkey yourself,” said he; “get along with your blooming cheek. Hout you goes!” “Oh! don’t be so cross,” said Jane, losing her head altogether, “don’t you see he really  does  want to know  that! ” “Ho! does ’e indeed,” sneered the merchant. Then he scratched his ear suspiciously, for he was a sharp business man, and he knew the ring of truth when he heard it. His hand was bandaged, and three minutes before he would have been glad to sell the “mangy old monkey” for ten shillings. Now— “Ho! ’E does, does ’e,” he said, “then two pun ten’s my price. He’s not got his fellow that monkey ain’t, nor yet his match, not this side of the equator, which he comes from. And the only one ever seen in London. Ought to be in the Zoo. Two pun ten, down on the nail, or  hout  you goes!” The children looked at each other—twenty-three shillings and fivepence was all they had in the world, and it would have been merely three and fivepence, but for the sovereign which Father had given to them “between them” at parting. “We’ve only twenty-three shillings and fivepence,” said Cyril, rattling the money in his pocket. “Twenty-three farthings and somebody’s own cheek,” said the dealer, for he did not believe that Cyril had so much money. There was a miserable pause. Then Anthea remembered, and said— “Oh! I  wish  I had two pounds ten.” “So do I, Miss, I’m sure,” said the man with bitter politeness; “I wish you “ad, I’m sure!” Anthea’s hand was on the counter, something seemed to slide under it. She lifted it. There lay five bright half sovereigns. “Why, I  have  got it after all,” she said; “here’s the money, now let’s have the Sammy,... the monkey I mean.” The dealer looked hard at the money, but he made haste to put it in his pocket. “I only hope you come by it honest,” he said, shrugging his shoulders. He scratched his ear again. “Well!” he said, “I suppose I must let you have it, but it’s worth thribble the money, so it is—” He slowly led the way out to the hutch—opened the door gingerly, and made a sudden fierce grab at the Psammead, which the Psammead acknowledged in one last long lingering bite. “Here, take the brute,” said the shopman, squeezing the Psammead so tight that he nearly choked it. “It’s bit me to the marrow, it have.” The man’s eyes opened as Anthea held out her arms. “Don’t blame me if it tears your face off its bones,” he said, and the Psammead made a leap from his dirty horny hands, and Anthea caught it in hers, which were not very clean, certainly, but at any rate were soft and pink, and held it kindly and closely. “But you can’t take it home like that,” Cyril said, “we shall have a crowd after us,” and indeed two errand boys and a policeman had already collected. “I can’t give you nothink only a paper-bag, like what we put the tortoises in,” said the man grudgingly. So the whole party went into the shop, and the shopman’s eyes nearly came out of his head when, having given Anthea the largest paper-bag he could find, he saw her hold it open, and the Psammead carefully creep into it. “Well!” he said, “if that there don’t beat cockfighting! But p’raps you’ve met the brute afore.” “Yes,” said Cyril affably, “he’s an old friend of ours.” “If I’d a known that,” the man rejoined, “you shouldn’t a had him under twice the money. ’Owever,” he added, as the children disappeared, “I ain’t done so bad, seeing as I only give five bob for the beast. But then there’s the bites to take into account!” The children trembling in agitation and excitement, carried home the Psammead, trembling in its paper-bag. When they got it home, Anthea nursed it, and stroked it, and would have cried over it, if she hadn’t remembered how it hated to be wet. When it recovered enough to speak, it said— “Get me sand; silver sand from the oil and colour shop. And get me plenty.” They got the sand, and they put it and the Psammead in the round bath together, and it rubbed itself, and rolled itself, and shook itself and scraped itself, and scratched itself, and preened itself, till it felt clean and comfy, and then it scrabbled a hasty hole in the sand, and went to sleep in it. The children hid the bath under the girls’ bed, and had supper. Old Nurse had got them a lovely supper of bread and butter and fried onions. She was full of kind and delicate thoughts. When Anthea woke the next morning, the Psammead was snuggling down between her shoulder and Jane’s. “You have saved my life,” it said. “I know that man would have thrown cold water on me sooner or later, and then I should have died. I saw him wash out a guinea-pig’s hutch yesterday morning. I’m still frightfully sleepy, I think I’ll go back to sand for another nap. Wake the boys and this dormouse of a Jane, and when you’ve had your breakfasts we’ll have a talk.” “Don’t  you  want any breakfast?” asked Anthea. “I daresay I shall pick a bit presently,” it said; “but sand is all I care about—it’s meat and drink to me, and coals and fire and wife and children.” With these words it clambered down by the bedclothes and scrambled back into the bath, where they heard it scratching itself out of sight. “Well!” said Anthea, “anyhow our holidays won’t be dull  now . We’ve found the Psammead again.” “No,” said Jane, beginning to put on her stockings. “We shan’t be  dull —but it’ll be only like having a pet dog now it can’t give us wishes.” “Oh, don’t be so discontented,” said Anthea. “If it can’t do anything else it can tell us about Megatheriums and things.” CHAPTER II. THE HALF AMULET Long ago—that is to say last summer—the children, finding themselves embarrassed by some wish which the Psammead had granted them, and which the servants had not received in a proper spirit, had wished that the servants might not notice the gifts which the Psammead gave. And when they parted from the Psammead their last wish had been that they should meet it again. Therefore they  had  met it (and it was jolly lucky for the Psammead, as Robert pointed out). Now, of course, you see that the Psammead’s being where it was, was the consequence of one of their wishes, and therefore was a Psammead-wish, and as such could not be noticed by the servants. And it was soon plain that in the Psammead’s opinion old Nurse was still a servant, although she had now a house of her own, for she never noticed the Psammead at all. And that was as well, for she would never have consented to allow the girls to keep an animal and a bath of sand under their bed. When breakfast had been cleared away—it was a very nice breakfast with hot rolls to it, a luxury quite out of the common way—Anthea went and dragged out the bath, and woke the Psammead. It stretched and shook itself. “You must have bolted your breakfast most unwholesomely,” it said, “you can’t have been five minutes over it.” “We’ve been nearly an hour,” said Anthea. “Come—you know you promised.” “Now look here,” said the Psammead, sitting back on the sand and shooting out its long eyes suddenly, “we’d better begin as we mean to go on. It won’t do to have any misunderstanding, so I tell you plainly that—” “Oh,  please ,” Anthea pleaded, “do wait till we get to the others. They’ll think it most awfully sneakish of me to talk to you without them; do come down, there’s a dear.” She knelt before the sand-bath and held out her arms. The Psammead must have remembered how glad it had been to jump into those same little arms only the day before, for it gave a little grudging grunt, and jumped once more. Anthea wrapped it in her pinafore and carried it downstairs. It was welcomed in a thrilling silence. At last Anthea said, “Now then!” “What place is this?” asked the Psammead, shooting its eyes out and turning them slowly round. “It’s a sitting-room, of course,” said Robert. “Then I don’t like it,” said the Psammead. “Never mind,” said Anthea kindly; “we’ll take you anywhere you like if you want us to. What was it you were going to say upstairs when I said the others wouldn’t like it if I stayed talking to you without them?” It looked keenly at her, and she blushed. “Don’t be silly,” it said sharply. “Of course, it’s quite natural that you should like your brothers and sisters to know exactly how good and unselfish you were.” “I wish you wouldn’t,” said Jane. “Anthea was quite right. What was it you were going to say when she stopped you?” “I’ll tell you,” said the Psammead, “since you’re so anxious to know. I was going to say this. You’ve saved my life—and I’m not ungrateful—but it doesn’t change your nature or mine. You’re still very ignorant, and rather silly, and I am worth a thousand of you any day of the week.” “Of course you are!” Anthea was beginning but it interrupted her. “It’s very rude to interrupt,” it said; “what I mean is that I’m not going to stand any nonsense, and if you think what you’ve done is to give you the right to pet me or make me demean myself by playing with you, you’ll find out that what you think doesn’t matter a single penny. See? It’s what  I  think that matters.” “I know,” said Cyril, “it always was, if you remember.” “Well,” said the Psammead, “then that’s settled. We’re to be treated as we deserve. I with respect, and all of you with—but I don’t wish to be offensive. Do you want me to tell you how I got into that horrible den you bought me out of? Oh, I’m not ungrateful! I haven’t forgotten it and I shan’t forget it.” “Do tell us,” said Anthea. “I know you’re awfully clever, but even with all your cleverness, I don’t believe you can possibly know how—how respectfully we do respect you. Don’t we?” The others all said yes—and fidgeted in their chairs. Robert spoke the wishes of all when he said— “I do wish you’d go on.” So it sat up on the green-covered table and went on. “When you’d gone away,” it said, “I went to sand for a bit, and slept. I was tired out with all your silly wishes, and I felt as though I hadn’t really been to sand for a year.” “To sand?” Jane repeated. “Where I sleep. You go to bed. I go to sand.” Jane yawned; the mention of bed made her feel sleepy. “All right,” said the Psammead, in offended tones. “I’m sure  I  don’t want to tell you a long tale. A man caught me, and I bit him. And he put me in a bag with a dead hare and a dead rabbit. And he took me to his house and put me out of the bag into a basket with holes that I could see through. And I bit him again. And then he brought me to this city, which I am told is called the Modern Babylon—though it’s not a bit like the old Babylon—and he sold me to the man you bought me from, and then I bit them both. Now, what’s your news?” “There’s not quite so much biting in our story,” said Cyril regretfully; “in fact, there isn’t any. Father’s gone to Manchuria, and Mother and The Lamb have gone to Madeira because Mother was ill, and don’t I just wish that they were both safe home again.” Merely from habit, the Sand-fairy began to blow itself out, but it stopped short suddenly. “I forgot,” it said; “I can’t give you any more wishes.” “No—but look here,” said Cyril, “couldn’t we call in old Nurse and get her to say  she  wishes they were safe home. I’m sure she does.” “No go,” said the Psammead. “It’s just the same as your wishing yourself if you get some one else to wish for you. It won’t act.” “But it did yesterday—with the man in the shop,” said Robert. “Ah yes,” said the creature, “but you didn’t  ask  him to wish, and you didn’t know what would happen if he did. That can’t be done again. It’s played out.” “Then you can’t help us at all,” said Jane; “oh—I did think you could do something; I’ve been thinking about it ever since we saved your life yesterday. I thought you’d be certain to be able to fetch back Father, even if you couldn’t manage Mother.” And Jane began to cry. “Now  don’t ,” said the Psammead hastily; “you know how it always upsets me if you cry. I can’t feel safe a moment. Look here; you must have some new kind of charm.” “That’s easier said than done.” “Not a bit of it,” said the creature; “there’s one of the strongest charms in the world not a stone’s throw from where you bought me yesterday. The man that I bit so—the first one, I mean—went into a shop to ask how much something cost—I think he said it was a concertina—and while he was telling the man in the shop how much too much he wanted for it, I saw the charm in a sort of tray, with a lot of other things. If you can only buy  that , you will be able to have your heart’s desire.” The children looked at each other and then at the Psammead. Then Cyril coughed awkwardly and took sudden courage to say what everyone was thinking. “I do hope you won’t be waxy,” he said; “but it’s like this: when you used to give us our wishes they almost always got us into some row or other, and we used to think you wouldn’t have been pleased if they hadn’t. Now, about this charm—we haven’t got over and above too much tin, and if we blue it all on this charm and it turns out to be not up to much—well—you see what I’m driving at, don’t you?” “I see that  you  don’t see more than the length of your nose, and  that’s  not far,” said the Psammead crossly. “Look here, I  had  to give you the wishes, and of course they turned out badly, in a sort of way, because you hadn’t the sense to wish for what was good for you. But this charm’s quite different. I haven’t  got  to do this for you, it’s just my own generous kindness that makes me tell you about it. So it’s bound to be all right. See?” “Don’t be cross,” said Anthea, “Please,  please  don’t. You see, it’s all we’ve got; we shan’t have any more pocket-money till Daddy comes home—unless he sends us some in a letter. But we  do  trust you. And I say all of you,” she went on, “don’t you think it’s worth spending  all  the money, if there’s even the chanciest chance of getting Father and Mother back safe  now?  Just think of it! Oh, do let’s!” “ I  don’t care what you do,” said the Psammead; “I’ll go back to sand again till you’ve made up your minds.” “No, don’t!” said everybody; and Jane added, “We are quite mind made-up—don’t you see we are? Let’s get our hats. Will you come with us?” “Of course,” said the Psammead; “how else would you find the shop?” So everybody got its hat. The Psammead was put into a flat bass-bag that had come from Farringdon Market with two pounds of filleted plaice in it. Now it contained about three pounds and a quarter of solid Psammead, and the children took it in turns to carry it. “It’s not half the weight of The Lamb,” Robert said, and the girls sighed. The Psammead poked a wary eye out of the top of the basket every now and then, and told the children which turnings to take. “How on earth do you know?” asked Robert. “I can’t think how you do it.” And the Psammead said sharply, “No—I don’t suppose you can.” At last they came to  the  shop. It had all sorts and kinds of things in the window—concertinas, and silk handkerchiefs, china vases and tea-cups, blue Japanese jars, pipes, swords, pistols, lace collars, silver spoons tied up in half-dozens, and wedding-rings in a red lacquered basin. There were officers’ epaulets and doctors’ lancets. There were tea-caddies inlaid with red turtle-shell and brass curly-wurlies, plates of different kinds of money, and stacks of different kinds of plates. There was a beautiful picture of a little girl washing a dog, which Jane liked very much. And in the middle of the window there was a dirty silver tray full of mother-of-pearl card counters, old seals, paste buckles, snuff-boxes, and all sorts of little dingy odds and ends. The Psammead put its head quite out of the fish-basket to look in the window, when Cyril said— “There’s a tray there with rubbish in it.” And then its long snail’s eyes saw something that made them stretch out so much that they were as long and thin as new slate-pencils. Its fur bristled thickly, and its voice was quite hoarse with excitement as it whispered— “That’s it! That’s it! There, under that blue and yellow buckle, you can see a bit sticking out. It’s red. Do you see?” “Is it that thing something like a horse-shoe?” asked Cyril. “And red, like the common sealing-wax you do up parcels with?” “Yes, that’s it,” said the Psammead. “Now, you do just as you did before. Ask the price of other things. That blue buckle would do. Then the man will get the tray out of the window. I think you’d better be the one,” it said to Anthea. “We’ll wait out here.” So the others flattened their noses against the shop window, and presently a large, dirty, short-fingered hand with a very big diamond ring came stretching through the green half-curtains at the back of the shop window and took away the tray. They could not see what was happening in the interview between Anthea and the Diamond Ring, and it seemed to them that she had had time—if she had had money—to buy everything in the shop before the moment came when she stood before them, her face wreathed in grins, as Cyril said later, and in her hand the charm. It was something like this:   and it was made of a red, smooth, softly shiny stone. “I’ve got it,” Anthea whispered, just opening her hand to give the others a glimpse of it. “Do let’s get home. We can’t stand here like stuck-pigs looking at it in the street.” So home they went. The parlour in Fitzroy Street was a very flat background to magic happenings. Down in the country among the flowers and green fields anything had seemed—and indeed had been—possible. But it was hard to believe that anything really wonderful could happen so near the Tottenham Court Road. But the Psammead was there—and it in itself was wonderful. And it could talk—and it had shown them where a charm could be bought that would make the owner of it perfectly happy. So the four children hurried home, taking very long steps, with their chins stuck out, and their mouths shut very tight indeed. They went so fast that the Psammead was quite shaken about in its fish-bag, but it did not say anything—perhaps for fear of attracting public notice. They got home at last, very hot indeed, and set the Psammead on the green tablecloth. “Now then!” said Cyril. But the Psammead had to have a plate of sand fetched for it, for it was quite faint. When it had refreshed itself a little it said— “Now then! Let me see the charm,” and Anthea laid it on the green table-cover. The Psammead shot out his long eyes to look at it, then it turned them reproachfully on Anthea and said— “But there’s only half of it here!” This was indeed a blow. “It was all there was,” said Anthea, with timid firmness. She knew it was not her fault. “There should be another piece,” said the Psammead, “and a sort of pin to fasten the two together.” “Isn’t half any good?”—“Won’t it work without the other bit?”—“It cost seven-and-six.”—“Oh, bother, bother, bother!”—“Don’t be silly little idiots!” said everyone and the Psammead altogether. Then there was a wretched silence. Cyril broke it— “What shall we do?” “Go back to the shop and see if they haven’t got the other half,” said the Psammead. “I’ll go to sand till you come back. Cheer up! Even the bit you’ve got is  some  good, but it’ll be no end of a bother if you can’t find the other.” So Cyril went to the shop. And the Psammead to sand. And the other three went to dinner, which was now ready. And old Nurse was very cross that Cyril was not ready too. The three were watching at the windows when Cyril returned, and even before he was near enough for them to see his face there was something about the slouch of his shoulders and set of his knickerbockers and the way he dragged his boots along that showed but too plainly that his errand had been in vain. “Well?” they all said, hoping against hope on the front-door step. “No go,” Cyril answered; “the man said the thing was perfect. He said it was a Roman lady’s locket, and people shouldn’t buy curios if they didn’t know anything about arky—something or other, and that he never went back on a bargain, because it wasn’t business, and he expected his customers to act the same. He was simply nasty—that’s what he was, and I want my dinner.” It was plain that Cyril was not pleased. The unlikeliness of anything really interesting happening in that parlour lay like a weight of lead on everyone’s spirits. Cyril had his dinner, and just as he was swallowing the last mouthful of apple-pudding there was a scratch at the door. Anthea opened it and in walked the Psammead. “Well,” it said, when it had heard the news, “things might be worse. Only you won’t be surprised if you have a few adventures before you get the other half. You want to get it, of course.” “Rather,” was the general reply. “And we don’t mind adventures.” “No,” said the Psammead, “I seem to remember that about you. Well, sit down and listen with all your ears. Eight, are there? Right—I am glad you know arithmetic. Now pay attention, because I don’t intend to tell you everything twice over.” As the children settled themselves on the floor—it was far more comfortable than the chairs, as well as more polite to the Psammead, who was stroking its whiskers on the hearth-rug—a sudden cold pain caught at Anthea’s heart. Father—Mother—the darling Lamb—all far away. Then a warm, comfortable feeling flowed through her. The Psammead was here, and at least half a charm, and there were to be adventures. (If you don’t know what a cold pain is, I am glad for your sakes, and I hope you never may.) “Now,” said the Psammead cheerily, “you are not particularly nice, nor particularly clever, and you’re not at all good-looking. Still, you’ve saved my life—oh, when I think of that man and his pail of water!—so I’ll tell you all I know. At least, of course I can’t do that, because I know far too much. But I’ll tell you all I know about this red thing.” “Do! Do! Do! Do!” said everyone. “Well, then,” said the Psammead. “This thing is half of an Amulet that can do all sorts of things; it can make the corn grow, and the waters flow, and the trees bear fruit, and the little new beautiful babies come. (Not that babies  are  beautiful, of course,” it broke off to say, “but their mothers think they are—and as long as you think a thing’s true it  is  true as far as you’re concerned.)” Robert yawned. The Psammead went on. “The complete Amulet can keep off all the things that make people unhappy—jealousy, bad temper, pride, disagreeableness, greediness, selfishness, laziness. Evil spirits, people called them when the Amulet was made. Don’t you think it would be nice to have it?” “Very,” said the children, quite without enthusiasm. “And it can give you strength and courage.” “That’s better,” said Cyril. “And virtue.” “I suppose it’s nice to have that,” said Jane, but not with much interest. “And it can give you your heart’s desire.” “Now you’re talking,” said Robert. “Of course I am,” retorted the Psammead tartly, “so there’s no need for you to.” “Heart’s desire is good enough for me,” said Cyril. “Yes, but,” Anthea ventured, “all that’s what the  whole  charm can do. There’s something that the half we’ve got can win off its own bat—isn’t there?” She appealed to the Psammead. It nodded. “Yes,” it said; “the half has the power to take you anywhere you like to look for the other half.” This seemed a brilliant prospect till Robert asked— “Does it know where to look?” The Psammead shook its head and answered, “I don’t think it’s likely.” “Do you?” “No.” “Then,” said Robert, “we might as well look for a needle in a bottle of hay. Yes—it  is  bottle, and not bundle, Father said so.” “Not at all,” said the Psammead briskly-, “you think you know everything, but you are quite mistaken. The first thing is to get the thing to talk.” “Can it?” Jane questioned. Jane’s question did not mean that she thought it couldn’t, for in spite of the parlour furniture the feeling of magic was growing deeper and thicker, and seemed to fill the room like a dream of a scented fog. “Of course it can. I suppose you can read.” “Oh yes!” Everyone was rather hurt at the question. “Well, then—all you’ve got to do is to read the name that’s written on the part of the charm that you’ve got. And as soon as you say the name out loud the thing will have power to do—well, several things.” There was a silence. The red charm was passed from hand to hand. “There’s no name on it,” said Cyril at last. “Nonsense,” said the Psammead; “what’s that?” “Oh,  that! ” said Cyril, “it’s not reading. It looks like pictures of chickens and snakes and things.” This was what was on the charm:   “I’ve no patience with you,” said the Psammead; “if you can’t read you must find some one who can. A priest now?” “We don’t know any priests,” said Anthea; “we know a clergyman—he’s called a priest in the prayer-book, you know—but he only knows Greek and Latin and Hebrew, and this isn’t any of those—I know.” The Psammead stamped a furry foot angrily. “I wish I’d never seen you,” it said; “you aren’t any more good than so many stone images. Not so much, if I’m to tell the truth. Is there no wise man in your Babylon who can pronounce the names of the Great Ones?” “There’s a poor learned gentleman upstairs,” said Anthea, “we might try him. He has a lot of stone images in his room, and iron-looking ones too—we peeped in once when he was out. Old Nurse says he doesn’t eat enough to keep a canary alive. He spends it all on stones and things.” “Try him,” said the Psammead, “only be careful. If he knows a greater name than this and uses it against you, your charm will be of no use. Bind him first with the chains of honour and upright dealing. And then ask his aid—oh, yes, you’d better all go; you can put me to sand as you go upstairs. I must have a few minutes’ peace and quietness.” So the four children hastily washed their hands and brushed their hair—this was Anthea’s idea—and went up to knock at the door of the “poor learned gentleman”, and to “bind him with the chains of honour and upright dealing”. CHAPTER III. THE PAST The learned gentleman had let his dinner get quite cold. It was mutton chop, and as it lay on the plate it looked like a brown island in the middle of a frozen pond, because the grease of the gravy had become cold, and consequently white. It looked very nasty, and it was the first thing the children saw when, after knocking three times and receiving no reply, one of them ventured to turn the handle and softly to open the door. The chop was on the end of a long table that ran down one side of the room. The table had images on it and queer-shaped stones, and books. And there were glass cases fixed against the wall behind, with little strange things in them. The cases were rather like the ones you see in jewellers’ shops. The “poor learned gentleman” was sitting at a table in the window, looking at something very small which he held in a pair of fine pincers. He had a round spy-glass sort of thing in one eye—which reminded the children of watchmakers, and also of the long snail’s eyes of the Psammead. The gentleman was very long and thin, and his long, thin boots stuck out under the other side of his table. He did not hear the door open, and the children stood hesitating. At last Robert gave the door a push, and they all started back, for in the middle of the wall that the door had hidden was a mummy-case—very, very, very big—painted in red and yellow and green and black, and the face of it seemed to look at them quite angrily. You know what a mummy-case is like, of course? If you don’t you had better go to the British Museum at once and find out. Anyway, it is not at all the sort of thing that you expect to meet in a top-floor front in Bloomsbury, looking as though it would like to know what business  you  had there. So everyone said, “Oh!” rather loud, and their boots clattered as they stumbled back. The learned gentleman took the glass out of his eye and said—“I beg your pardon,” in a very soft, quiet pleasant voice—the voice of a gentleman who has been to Oxford. “It’s us that beg yours,” said Cyril politely. “We are sorry to disturb you.” “Come in,” said the gentleman, rising—with the most distinguished courtesy, Anthea told herself. “I am delighted to see you. Won’t you sit down? No, not there; allow me to move that papyrus.” He cleared a chair, and stood smiling and looking kindly through his large, round spectacles. “He treats us like grown-ups,” whispered Robert, “and he doesn’t seem to know how many of us there are.” “Hush,” said Anthea, “it isn’t manners to whisper. You say, Cyril—go ahead.” “We’re very sorry to disturb you,” said Cyril politely, “but we did knock three times, and you didn’t say ‘Come in’, or ‘Run away now’, or that you couldn’t be bothered just now, or to come when you weren’t so busy, or any of the things people do say when you knock at doors, so we opened it. We knew you were in because we heard you sneeze while we were waiting.” “Not at all,” said the gentleman; “do sit down.” “He has found out there are four of us,” said Robert, as the gentleman cleared three more chairs. He put the things off them carefully on the floor. The first chair had things like bricks that tiny, tiny birds’ feet have walked over when the bricks were soft, only the marks were in regular lines. The second chair had round things on it like very large, fat, long, pale beads. And the last chair had a pile of dusty papers on it. The children sat down. “We know you are very, very learned,” said Cyril, “and we have got a charm, and we want you to read the name on it, because it isn’t in Latin or Greek, or Hebrew, or any of the languages  we  know—” “A thorough knowledge of even those languages is a very fair foundation on which to build an education,” said the gentleman politely. “Oh!” said Cyril blushing, “but we only know them to look at, except Latin—and I’m only in Caesar with that.” The gentleman took off his spectacles and laughed. His laugh sounded rusty, Cyril thought, as though it wasn’t often used. “Of course!” he said. “I’m sure I beg your pardon. I think I must have been in a dream. You are the children who live downstairs, are you not? Yes. I have seen you as I have passed in and out. And you have found something that you think to be an antiquity, and you’ve brought it to show me? That was very kind. I should like to inspect it.” “I’m afraid we didn’t think about your liking to inspect it,” said the truthful Anthea. “It was just for  us —because we wanted to know the name on it—” “Oh, yes—and, I say,” Robert interjected, “you won’t think it rude of us if we ask you first, before we show it, to be bound in the what-do-you-call-it of—” “In the bonds of honour and upright dealing,” said Anthea. “I’m afraid I don’t quite follow you,” said the gentleman, with gentle nervousness. “Well, it’s this way,” said Cyril. “We’ve got part of a charm. And the Sammy—I mean, something told us it would work, though it’s only half a one; but it won’t work unless we can say the name that’s on it. But, of course, if you’ve got another name that can lick ours, our charm will be no go; so we want you to give us your word of honour as a gentleman—though I’m sure, now I’ve seen you, that it’s not necessary; but still I’ve promised to ask you, so we must. Will you please give us your honourable word not to say any name stronger than the name on our charm?” The gentleman had put on his spectacles again and was looking at Cyril through them. He now said: “Bless me!” more than once, adding, “Who told you all this?” “I can’t tell you,” said Cyril. “I’m very sorry, but I can’t.” Some faint memory of a far-off childhood must have come to the learned gentleman just then, for he smiled. “I see,” he said. “It is some sort of game that you are engaged in? Of course! Yes! Well, I will certainly promise. Yet I wonder how you heard of the names of power?” “We can’t tell you that either,” said Cyril; and Anthea said, “Here is our charm,” and held it out. With politeness, but without interest, the gentleman took it. But after the first glance all his body suddenly stiffened, as a pointer’s does when he sees a partridge. “Excuse me,” he said in quite a changed voice, and carried the charm to the window. He looked at it; he turned it over. He fixed his spy-glass in his eye and looked again. No one said anything. Only Robert made a shuffling noise with his feet till Anthea nudged him to shut up. At last the learned gentleman drew a long breath. “Where did you find this?” he asked. “We didn’t find it. We bought it at a shop. Jacob Absalom the name is—not far from Charing Cross,” said Cyril. “We gave seven-and-sixpence for it,” added Jane. “It is not for sale, I suppose? You do not wish to part with it? I ought to tell you that it is extremely valuable—extraordinarily valuable, I may say.” “Yes,” said Cyril, “we know that, so of course we want to keep it.” “Keep it carefully, then,” said the gentleman impressively; “and if ever you should wish to part with it, may I ask you to give me the refusal of it?” “The refusal?” “I mean, do not sell it to anyone else until you have given me the opportunity of buying it.” “All right,” said Cyril, “we won’t. But we don’t want to sell it. We want to make it do things.” “I suppose you can play at that as well as at anything else,” said the gentleman; “but I’m afraid the days of magic are over.” “They aren’t  really ,” said Anthea earnestly. “You’d see they aren’t if I could tell you about our last summer holidays. Only I mustn’t. Thank you very much. And can you read the name?” “Yes, I can read it.” “Will you tell it us?” “The name,” said the gentleman, “is Ur Hekau Setcheh.” “Ur Hekau Setcheh,” repeated Cyril. “Thanks awfully. I do hope we haven’t taken up too much of your time.” “Not at all,” said the gentleman. “And do let me entreat you to be very, very careful of that most valuable specimen.” They said “Thank you” in all the different polite ways they could think of, and filed out of the door and down the stairs. Anthea was last. Half-way down to the first landing she turned and ran up again. The door was still open, and the learned gentleman and the mummy-case were standing opposite to each other, and both looked as though they had stood like that for years. The gentleman started when Anthea put her hand on his arm. “I hope you won’t be cross and say it’s not my business,” she said, “but do look at your chop! Don’t you think you ought to eat it? Father forgets his dinner sometimes when he’s writing, and Mother always says I ought to remind him if she’s not at home to do it herself, because it’s so bad to miss your regular meals. So I thought perhaps you wouldn’t mind my reminding you, because you don’t seem to have anyone else to do it.” She glanced at the mummy-case;  it  certainly did not look as though it would ever think of reminding people of their meals. The learned gentleman looked at her for a moment before he said— “Thank you, my dear. It was a kindly thought. No, I haven’t anyone to remind me about things like that.” He sighed, and looked at the chop. “It looks very nasty,” said Anthea. “Yes,” he said, “it does. I’ll eat it immediately, before I forget.” As he ate it he sighed more than once. Perhaps because the chop was nasty, perhaps because he longed for the charm which the children did not want to sell, perhaps because it was so long since anyone cared whether he ate his chops or forgot them. Anthea caught the others at the stair-foot. They woke the Psammead, and it taught them exactly how to use the word of power, and to make the charm speak. I am not going to tell you how this is done, because you might try to do it. And for you any such trying would be almost sure to end in disappointment. Because in the first place it is a thousand million to one against your ever getting hold of the right sort of charm, and if you did, there would be hardly any chance at all of your finding a learned gentleman clever enough and kind enough to read the word for you. The children and the Psammead crouched in a circle on the floor—in the girls’ bedroom, because in the parlour they might have been interrupted by old Nurse’s coming in to lay the cloth for tea—and the charm was put in the middle of the circle. The sun shone splendidly outside, and the room was very light. Through the open window came the hum and rattle of London, and in the street below they could hear the voice of the milkman. When all was ready, the Psammead signed to Anthea to say the word. And she said it. Instantly the whole light of all the world seemed to go out. The room was dark. The world outside was dark—darker than the darkest night that ever was. And all the sounds went out too, so that there was a silence deeper than any silence you have ever even dreamed of imagining. It was like being suddenly deaf and blind, only darker and quieter even than that. But before the children had got over the sudden shock of it enough to be frightened, a faint, beautiful light began to show in the middle of the circle, and at the same moment a faint, beautiful voice began to speak. The light was too small for one to see anything by, and the voice was too small for you to hear what it said. You could just see the light and just hear the voice. But the light grew stronger. It was greeny, like glow-worms’ lamps, and it grew and grew till it was as though thousands and thousands of glow-worms were signalling to their winged sweethearts from the middle of the circle. And the voice grew, not so much in loudness as in sweetness (though it grew louder, too), till it was so sweet that you wanted to cry with pleasure just at the sound of it. It was like nightingales, and the sea, and the fiddle, and the voice of your mother when you have been a long time away, and she meets you at the door when you get home. And the voice said— “Speak. What is it that you would hear?” I cannot tell you what language the voice used. I only know that everyone present understood it perfectly. If you come to think of it, there must be some language that everyone could understand, if we only knew what it was. Nor can I tell you how the charm spoke, nor whether it was the charm that spoke, or some presence in the charm. The children could not have told you either. Indeed, they could not look at the charm while it was speaking, because the light was too bright. They looked instead at the green radiance on the faded Kidderminster carpet at the edge of the circle. They all felt very quiet, and not inclined to ask questions or fidget with their feet. For this was not like the things that had happened in the country when the Psammead had given them their wishes. That had been funny somehow, and this was not. It was something like  Arabian Nights  magic, and something like being in church. No one cared to speak. It was Cyril who said at last— “Please we want to know where the other half of the charm is.” “The part of the Amulet which is lost,” said the beautiful voice, “was broken and ground into the dust of the shrine that held it. It and the pin that joined the two halves are themselves dust, and the dust is scattered over many lands and sunk in many seas.” “Oh, I say!” murmured Robert, and a blank silence fell. “Then it’s all up?” said Cyril at last; “it’s no use our looking for a thing that’s smashed into dust, and the dust scattered all over the place.” “If you would find it,” said the voice, “You must seek it where it still is, perfect as ever.” “I don’t understand,” said Cyril. “In the Past you may find it,” said the voice. “I wish we  may  find it,” said Cyril. The Psammead whispered crossly, “Don’t you understand? The thing existed in the Past. If you were in the Past, too, you could find it. It’s very difficult to make you understand things. Time and space are only forms of thought.” “I see,” said Cyril. “No, you don’t,” said the Psammead, “and it doesn’t matter if you don’t, either. What I mean is that if you were only made the right way, you could see everything happening in the same place at the same time. Now do you see?” “I’m afraid  I  don’t,” said Anthea; “I’m sorry I’m so stupid.” “Well, at any rate, you see this. That lost half of the Amulet is in the Past. Therefore it’s in the Past we must look for it. I mustn’t speak to the charm myself. Ask it things! Find out!” “Where can we find the other part of you?” asked Cyril obediently. “In the Past,” said the voice. “What part of the Past?” “I may not tell you. If you will choose a time, I will take you to the place that then held it. You yourselves must find it.” “When did you see it last?” asked Anthea—“I mean, when was it taken away from you?” The beautiful voice answered— “That was thousands of years ago. The Amulet was perfect then, and lay in a shrine, the last of many shrines, and I worked wonders. Then came strange men with strange weapons and destroyed my shrine, and the Amulet they bore away with many captives. But of these, one, my priest, knew the word of power, and spoke it for me, so that the Amulet became invisible, and thus returned to my shrine, but the shrine was broken down, and ere any magic could rebuild it one spoke a word before which my power bowed down and was still. And the Amulet lay there, still perfect, but enslaved. Then one coming with stones to rebuild the shrine, dropped a hewn stone on the Amulet as it lay, and one half was sundered from the other. I had no power to seek for that which was lost. And there being none to speak the word of power, I could not rejoin it. So the Amulet lay in the dust of the desert many thousand years, and at last came a small man, a conqueror with an army, and after him a crowd of men who sought to seem wise, and one of these found half the Amulet and brought it to this land. But none could read the name. So I lay still. And this man dying and his son after him, the Amulet was sold by those who came after to a merchant, and from him you bought it, and it is here, and now, the name of power having been spoken, I also am here.” This is what the voice said. I think it must have meant Napoleon by the small man, the conqueror. Because I know I have been told that he took an army to Egypt, and that afterwards a lot of wise people went grubbing in the sand, and fished up all sorts of wonderful things, older than you would think possible. And of these I believe this charm to have been one, and the most wonderful one of all. Everyone listened: and everyone tried to think. It is not easy to do this clearly when you have been listening to the kind of talk I have told you about. At last Robert said— “Can you take us into the Past—to the shrine where you and the other thing were together. If you could take us there, we might find the other part still there after all these thousands of years.” “Still there? silly!” said Cyril. “Don’t you see, if we go back into the Past it won’t be thousands of years ago. It will be  now  for us—won’t it?” He appealed to the Psammead, who said— “You’re not so far off the idea as you usually are!” “Well,” said Anthea, “will you take us back to when there was a shrine and you were safe in it—all of you?” “Yes,” said the voice. “You must hold me up, and speak the word of power, and one by one, beginning with the first-born, you shall pass through me into the Past. But let the last that passes be the one that holds me, and let him not lose his hold, lest you lose me, and so remain in the Past for ever.” “That’s a nasty idea,” said Robert. “When you desire to return,” the beautiful voice went on, “hold me up towards the East, and speak the word. Then, passing through me, you shall return to this time and it shall be the present to you.” “But how—” A bell rang loudly. “Oh crikey!” exclaimed Robert, “that’s tea! Will you please make it proper daylight again so that we can go down. And thank you so much for all your kindness.” “We’ve enjoyed ourselves very much indeed, thank you!” added Anthea politely. The beautiful light faded slowly. The great darkness and silence came and these suddenly changed to the dazzlement of day and the great soft, rustling sound of London, that is like some vast beast turning over in its sleep. The children rubbed their eyes, the Psammead ran quickly to its sandy bath, and the others went down to tea. And until the cups were actually filled tea seemed less real than the beautiful voice and the greeny light. After tea Anthea persuaded the others to allow her to hang the charm round her neck with a piece of string. “It would be so awful if it got lost,” she said: “it might get lost anywhere, you know, and it would be rather beastly for us to have to stay in the Past for ever and ever, wouldn’t it?” CHAPTER IV. EIGHT THOUSAND YEARS AGO Next morning Anthea got old Nurse to allow her to take up the “poor learned gentleman’s” breakfast. He did not recognize her at first, but when he did he was vaguely pleased to see her. “You see I’m wearing the charm round my neck,” she said; “I’m taking care of it—like you told us to.” “That’s right,” said he; “did you have a good game last night?” “You will eat your breakfast before it’s cold, won’t you?” said Anthea. “Yes, we had a splendid time. The charm made it all dark, and then greeny light, and then it spoke. Oh! I wish you could have heard it—it was such a darling voice—and it told us the other half of it was lost in the Past, so of course we shall have to look for it there!” The learned gentleman rubbed his hair with both hands and looked anxiously at Anthea. “I suppose it’s natural—youthful imagination and so forth,” he said. “Yet someone must have... Who told you that some part of the charm was missing?” “I can’t tell you,” she said. “I know it seems most awfully rude, especially after being so kind about telling us the name of power, and all that, but really, I’m not allowed to tell anybody anything about the—the—the person who told me. You won’t forget your breakfast, will you?” The learned gentleman smiled feebly and then frowned—not a cross-frown, but a puzzle-frown. “Thank you,” he said, “I shall always be pleased if you’ll look in—any time you’re passing you know—at least...” “I will,” she said; “goodbye. I’ll always tell you anything I  may  tell.” He had not had many adventures with children in them, and he wondered whether all children were like these. He spent quite five minutes in wondering before he settled down to the fifty-second chapter of his great book on  The Secret Rites of the Priests of Amen Rā . It is no use to pretend that the children did not feel a good deal of agitation at the thought of going through the charm into the Past. That idea, that perhaps they might stay in the Past and never get back again, was anything but pleasing. Yet no one would have dared to suggest that the charm should not be used; and though each was in its heart very frightened indeed, they would all have joined in jeering at the cowardice of any one of them who should have uttered the timid but natural suggestion, “Don’t let’s!” It seemed necessary to make arrangements for being out all day, for there was no reason to suppose that the sound of the dinner-bell would be able to reach back into the Past, and it seemed unwise to excite old Nurse’s curiosity when nothing they could say—not even the truth—could in any way satisfy it. They were all very proud to think how well they had understood what the charm and the Psammead had said about Time and Space and things like that, and they were perfectly certain that it would be quite impossible to make old Nurse understand a single word of it. So they merely asked her to let them take their dinner out into Regent’s Park—and this, with the implied cold mutton and tomatoes, was readily granted. “You can get yourselves some buns or sponge-cakes, or whatever you fancy-like,” said old Nurse, giving Cyril a shilling. “Don’t go getting jam-tarts, now—so messy at the best of times, and without forks and plates ruination to your clothes, besides your not being able to wash your hands and faces afterwards.” So Cyril took the shilling, and they all started off. They went round by the Tottenham Court Road to buy a piece of waterproof sheeting to put over the Psammead in case it should be raining in the Past when they got there. For it is almost certain death to a Psammead to get wet. The sun was shining very brightly, and even London looked pretty. Women were selling roses from big baskets-full, and Anthea bought four roses, one each, for herself and the others. They were red roses and smelt of summer—the kind of roses you always want so desperately at about Christmas-time when you can only get mistletoe, which is pale right through to its very scent, and holly which pricks your nose if you try to smell it. So now everyone had a rose in its buttonhole, and soon everyone was sitting on the grass in Regent’s Park under trees whose leaves would have been clean, clear green in the country, but here were dusty and yellowish, and brown at the edges. “We’ve got to go on with it,” said Anthea, “and as the eldest has to go first, you’ll have to be last, Jane. You quite understand about holding on to the charm as you go through, don’t you, Pussy?” “I wish I hadn’t got to be last,” said Jane. “You shall carry the Psammead if you like,” said Anthea. “That is,” she added, remembering the beast’s queer temper, “if it’ll let you.” The Psammead, however, was unexpectedly amiable. “ I  don’t mind,” it said, “who carries me, so long as it doesn’t drop me. I can’t bear being dropped.” Jane with trembling hands took the Psammead and its fish-basket under one arm. The charm’s long string was hung round her neck. Then they all stood up. Jane held out the charm at arm’s length, and Cyril solemnly pronounced the word of power. As he spoke it the charm grew tall and broad, and he saw that Jane was just holding on to the edge of a great red arch of very curious shape. The opening of the arch was small, but Cyril saw that he could go through it. All round and beyond the arch were the faded trees and trampled grass of Regent’s Park, where the little ragged children were playing Ring-o’-Roses. But through the opening of it shone a blaze of blue and yellow and red. Cyril drew a long breath and stiffened his legs so that the others should not see that his knees were trembling and almost knocking together. “Here goes!” he said, and, stepping up through the arch, disappeared. Then followed Anthea. Robert, coming next, held fast, at Anthea’s suggestion, to the sleeve of Jane, who was thus dragged safely through the arch. And as soon as they were on the other side of the arch there was no more arch at all and no more Regent’s Park either, only the charm in Jane’s hand, and it was its proper size again. They were now in a light so bright that they winked and blinked and rubbed their eyes. During this dazzling interval Anthea felt for the charm and pushed it inside Jane’s frock, so that it might be quite safe. When their eyes got used to the new wonderful light the children looked around them. The sky was very, very blue, and it sparkled and glittered and dazzled like the sea at home when the sun shines on it. They were standing on a little clearing in a thick, low forest; there were trees and shrubs and a close, thorny, tangly undergrowth. In front of them stretched a bank of strange black mud, then came the browny-yellowy shining ribbon of a river. Then more dry, caked mud and more greeny-browny jungle. The only things that told that human people had been there were the clearing, a path that led to it, and an odd arrangement of cut reeds in the river. They looked at each other. “Well!” said Robert, “this  is  a change of air!” It was. The air was hotter than they could have imagined, even in London in August. “I wish I knew where we were,” said Cyril. “Here’s a river, now—I wonder whether it’s the Amazon or the Tiber, or what.” “It’s the Nile,” said the Psammead, looking out of the fish-bag. “Then this is Egypt,” said Robert, who had once taken a geography prize. “I don’t see any crocodiles,” Cyril objected. His prize had been for natural history. The Psammead reached out a hairy arm from its basket and pointed to a heap of mud at the edge of the water. “What do you call that?” it said; and as it spoke the heap of mud slid into the river just as a slab of damp mixed mortar will slip from a bricklayer’s trowel. “Oh!” said everybody. There was a crashing among the reeds on the other side of the water. “And there’s a river-horse!” said the Psammead, as a great beast like an enormous slaty-blue slug showed itself against the black bank on the far side of the stream. “It’s a hippopotamus,” said Cyril; “it seems much more real somehow than the one at the Zoo, doesn’t it?” “I’m glad it’s being real on the other side of the river,” said Jane. And now there was a crackling of reeds and twigs behind them. This was horrible. Of course it might be another hippopotamus, or a crocodile, or a lion—or, in fact, almost anything. “Keep your hand on the charm, Jane,” said Robert hastily. “We ought to have a means of escape handy. I’m dead certain this is the sort of place where simply anything  might  happen to us.” “I believe a hippopotamus is going to happen to us,” said Jane—“a very, very big one.” They had all turned to face the danger. “Don’t be silly little duffers,” said the Psammead in its friendly, informal way; “it’s not a river-horse. It’s a human.” It was. It was a girl—of about Anthea’s age. Her hair was short and fair, and though her skin was tanned by the sun, you could see that it would have been fair too if it had had a chance. She had every chance of being tanned, for she had no clothes to speak of, and the four English children, carefully dressed in frocks, hats, shoes, stockings, coats, collars, and all the rest of it, envied her more than any words of theirs or of mine could possibly say. There was no doubt that here was the right costume for that climate. She carried a pot on her head, of red and black earthenware. She did not see the children, who shrank back against the edge of the jungle, and she went forward to the brink of the river to fill her pitcher. As she went she made a strange sort of droning, humming, melancholy noise all on two notes. Anthea could not help thinking that perhaps the girl thought this noise was singing. The girl filled the pitcher and set it down by the river bank. Then she waded into the water and stooped over the circle of cut reeds. She pulled half a dozen fine fish out of the water within the reeds, killing each as she took it out, and threading it on a long osier that she carried. Then she knotted the osier, hung it on her arm, picked up the pitcher, and turned to come back. And as she turned she saw the four children. The white dresses of Jane and Anthea stood out like snow against the dark forest background. She screamed and the pitcher fell, and the water was spilled out over the hard mud surface and over the fish, which had fallen too. Then the water slowly trickled away into the deep cracks. “Don’t be frightened,” Anthea cried, “we won’t hurt you.” “Who are you?” said the girl. Now, once for all, I am not going to be bothered to tell you how it was that the girl could understand Anthea and Anthea could understand the girl.  You , at any rate, would not understand  me , if I tried to explain it, any more than you can understand about time and space being only forms of thought. You may think what you like. Perhaps the children had found out the universal language which everyone can understand, and which wise men so far have not found. You will have noticed long ago that they were singularly lucky children, and they may have had this piece of luck as well as others. Or it may have been that... but why pursue the question further? The fact remains that in all their adventures the muddle-headed inventions which we call foreign languages never bothered them in the least. They could always understand and be understood. If you can explain this, please do. I daresay I could understand your explanation, though you could never understand mine. So when the girl said, “Who are you?” everyone understood at once, and Anthea replied— “We are children—just like you. Don’t be frightened. Won’t you show us where you live?” Jane put her face right into the Psammead’s basket, and burrowed her mouth into its fur to whisper— “Is it safe? Won’t they eat us? Are they cannibals?” The Psammead shrugged its fur. “Don’t make your voice buzz like that, it tickles my ears,” it said rather crossly. “You can always get back to Regent’s Park in time if you keep fast hold of the charm,” it said. The strange girl was trembling with fright. Anthea had a bangle on her arm. It was a sevenpenny-halfpenny trumpery thing that pretended to be silver; it had a glass heart of turquoise blue hanging from it, and it was the gift of the maid-of-all-work at the Fitzroy Street house. “Here,” said Anthea, “this is for you. That is to show we will not hurt you. And if you take it I shall know that you won’t hurt us.” The girl held out her hand. Anthea slid the bangle over it, and the girl’s face lighted up with the joy of possession. “Come,” she said, looking lovingly at the bangle; “it is peace between your house and mine.” She picked up her fish and pitcher and led the way up the narrow path by which she had come and the others followed. “This is something like!” said Cyril, trying to be brave. “Yes!” said Robert, also assuming a boldness he was far from feeling, “this really and truly  is  an adventure! Its being in the Past makes it quite different from the Phœnix and Carpet happenings.” The belt of thick-growing acacia trees and shrubs—mostly prickly and unpleasant-looking—seemed about half a mile across. The path was narrow and the wood dark. At last, ahead, daylight shone through the boughs and leaves. The whole party suddenly came out of the wood’s shadow into the glare of the sunlight that shone on a great stretch of yellow sand, dotted with heaps of grey rocks where spiky cactus plants showed gaudy crimson and pink flowers among their shabby, sand-peppered leaves. Away to the right was something that looked like a grey-brown hedge, and from beyond it blue smoke went up to the bluer sky. And over all the sun shone till you could hardly bear your clothes. “That is where I live,” said the girl pointing. “I won’t go,” whispered Jane into the basket, “unless you say it’s all right.” The Psammead ought to have been touched by this proof of confidence. Perhaps, however, it looked upon it as a proof of doubt, for it merely snarled— “If you don’t go now I’ll never help you again.” “ Oh ,” whispered Anthea, “dear Jane, don’t! Think of Father and Mother and all of us getting our heart’s desire. And we can go back any minute. Come on!” “Besides,” said Cyril, in a low voice, “the Psammead must know there’s no danger or it wouldn’t go. It’s not so over and above brave itself. Come on!” This Jane at last consented to do. As they got nearer to the browny fence they saw that it was a great hedge about eight feet high, made of piled-up thorn bushes. “What’s that for?” asked Cyril. “To keep out foes and wild beasts,” said the girl. “I should think it ought to, too,” said he. “Why, some of the thorns are as long as my foot.” There was an opening in the hedge, and they followed the girl through it. A little way further on was another hedge, not so high, also of dry thorn bushes, very prickly and spiteful-looking, and within this was a sort of village of huts. There were no gardens and no roads. Just huts built of wood and twigs and clay, and roofed with great palm-leaves, dumped down anywhere. The doors of these houses were very low, like the doors of dog-kennels. The ground between them was not paths or streets, but just yellow sand trampled very hard and smooth. In the middle of the village there was a hedge that enclosed what seemed to be a piece of ground about as big as their own garden in Camden Town. No sooner were the children well within the inner thorn hedge than dozens of men and women and children came crowding round from behind and inside the huts. The girl stood protectingly in front of the four children, and said— “They are wonder-children from beyond the desert. They bring marvellous gifts, and I have said that it is peace between us and them.” She held out her arm with the Lowther Arcade bangle on it. The children from London, where nothing now surprises anyone, had never before seen so many people look so astonished. They crowded round the children, touching their clothes, their shoes, the buttons on the boys’ jackets, and the coral of the girls’ necklaces. “Do say something,” whispered Anthea. “We come,” said Cyril, with some dim remembrance of a dreadful day when he had had to wait in an outer office while his father interviewed a solicitor, and there had been nothing to read but the  Daily Telegraph —“we come from the world where the sun never sets. And peace with honour is what we want. We are the great Anglo-Saxon or conquering race. Not that we want to conquer  you ,” he added hastily. “We only want to look at your houses and your—well, at all you’ve got here, and then we shall return to our own place, and tell of all that we have seen so that your name may be famed.” Cyril’s speech didn’t keep the crowd from pressing round and looking as eagerly as ever at the clothing of the children. Anthea had an idea that these people had never seen woven stuff before, and she saw how wonderful and strange it must seem to people who had never had any clothes but the skins of beasts. The sewing, too, of modern clothes seemed to astonish them very much. They must have been able to sew themselves, by the way, for men who seemed to be the chiefs wore knickerbockers of goat-skin or deer-skin, fastened round the waist with twisted strips of hide. And the women wore long skimpy skirts of animals’ skins. The people were not very tall, their hair was fair, and men and women both had it short. Their eyes were blue, and that seemed odd in Egypt. Most of them were tattooed like sailors, only more roughly. “What is this? What is this?” they kept asking touching the children’s clothes curiously. Anthea hastily took off Jane’s frilly lace collar and handed it to the woman who seemed most friendly. “Take this,” she said, “and look at it. And leave us alone. We want to talk among ourselves.” She spoke in the tone of authority which she had always found successful when she had not time to coax her baby brother to do as he was told. The tone was just as successful now. The children were left together and the crowd retreated. It paused a dozen yards away to look at the lace collar and to go on talking as hard as it could. The children will never know what those people said, though they knew well enough that they, the four strangers, were the subject of the talk. They tried to comfort themselves by remembering the girl’s promise of friendliness, but of course the thought of the charm was more comfortable than anything else. They sat down on the sand in the shadow of the hedged-round place in the middle of the village, and now for the first time they were able to look about them and to see something more than a crowd of eager, curious faces. They here noticed that the women wore necklaces made of beads of different coloured stone, and from these hung pendants of odd, strange shapes, and some of them had bracelets of ivory and flint. “I say,” said Robert, “what a lot we could teach them if we stayed here!” “I expect they could teach us something too,” said Cyril. “Did you notice that flint bracelet the woman had that Anthea gave the collar to? That must have taken some making. Look here, they’ll get suspicious if we talk among ourselves, and I do want to know about how they do things. Let’s get the girl to show us round, and we can be thinking about how to get the Amulet at the same time. Only mind, we must keep together.” Anthea beckoned to the girl, who was standing a little way off looking wistfully at them, and she came gladly. “Tell us how you make the bracelets, the stone ones,” said Cyril. “With other stones,” said the girl; “the men make them; we have men of special skill in such work.” “Haven’t you any iron tools?” “Iron,” said the girl, “I don’t know what you mean.” It was the first word she had not understood. “Are all your tools of flint?” asked Cyril. “Of course,” said the girl, opening her eyes wide. I wish I had time to tell you of that talk. The English children wanted to hear all about this new place, but they also wanted to tell of their own country. It was like when you come back from your holidays and you want to hear and to tell everything at the same time. As the talk went on there were more and more words that the girl could not understand, and the children soon gave up the attempt to explain to her what their own country was like, when they began to see how very few of the things they had always thought they could not do without were really not at all necessary to life. The girl showed them how the huts were made—indeed, as one was being made that very day she took them to look at it. The way of building was very different from ours. The men stuck long pieces of wood into a piece of ground the size of the hut they wanted to make. These were about eight inches apart; then they put in another row about eight inches away from the first, and then a third row still further out. Then all the space between was filled up with small branches and twigs, and then daubed over with black mud worked with the feet till it was soft and sticky like putty. The girl told them how the men went hunting with flint spears and arrows, and how they made boats with reeds and clay. Then she explained the reed thing in the river that she had taken the fish out of. It was a fish-trap—just a ring of reeds set up in the water with only one little opening in it, and in this opening, just below the water, were stuck reeds slanting the way of the river’s flow, so that the fish, when they had swum sillily in, sillily couldn’t get out again. She showed them the clay pots and jars and platters, some of them ornamented with black and red patterns, and the most wonderful things made of flint and different sorts of stone, beads, and ornaments, and tools and weapons of all sorts and kinds. “It is really wonderful,” said Cyril patronizingly, “when you consider that it’s all eight thousand years ago—” “I don’t understand you,” said the girl. “It  isn’t  eight thousand years ago,” whispered Jane. “It’s  now —and that’s just what I don’t like about it. I say,  do  let’s get home again before anything more happens. You can see for yourselves the charm isn’t here.” “What’s in that place in the middle?” asked Anthea, struck by a sudden thought, and pointing to the fence. “That’s the secret sacred place,” said the girl in a whisper. “No one knows what is there. There are many walls, and inside the insidest one  It  is, but no one knows what  It  is except the headsmen.” “I believe  you  know,” said Cyril, looking at her very hard. “I’ll give you this if you’ll tell me,” said Anthea taking off a bead-ring which had already been much admired. “Yes,” said the girl, catching eagerly at the ring. “My father is one of the heads, and I know a water charm to make him talk in his sleep. And he has spoken. I will tell you. But if they know I have told you they will kill me. In the insidest inside there is a stone box, and in it there is the Amulet. None knows whence it came. It came from very far away.” “Have you seen it?” asked Anthea. The girl nodded. “Is it anything like this?” asked Jane, rashly producing the charm. The girl’s face turned a sickly greenish-white. “Hide it, hide it,” she whispered. “You must put it back. If they see it they will kill us all. You for taking it, and me for knowing that there was such a thing. Oh, woe—woe! why did you ever come here?” “Don’t be frightened,” said Cyril. “They shan’t know. Jane, don’t you be such a little jack-ape again—that’s all. You see what will happen if you do. Now, tell me—” He turned to the girl, but before he had time to speak the question there was a loud shout, and a man bounded in through the opening in the thorn-hedge. “Many foes are upon us!” he cried. “Make ready the defences!” His breath only served for that, and he lay panting on the ground. “Oh,  do  let’s go home!” said Jane. “Look here—I don’t care—I  will! ” She held up the charm. Fortunately all the strange, fair people were too busy to notice  her . She held up the charm. And nothing happened. “You haven’t said the word of power,” said Anthea. Jane hastily said it—and still nothing happened. “Hold it up towards the East, you silly!” said Robert. “Which  is  the East?” said Jane, dancing about in her agony of terror. Nobody knew. So they opened the fish-bag to ask the Psammead. And the bag had only a waterproof sheet in it. The Psammead was gone. “Hide the sacred thing! Hide it! Hide it!” whispered the girl. Cyril shrugged his shoulders, and tried to look as brave as he knew he ought to feel. “Hide it up, Pussy,” he said. “We are in for it now. We’ve just got to stay and see it out.” CHAPTER V. THE FIGHT IN THE VILLAGE Here was a horrible position! Four English children, whose proper date was A.D. 1905, and whose proper address was London, set down in Egypt in the year 6000 B.C. with no means whatever of getting back into their own time and place. They could not find the East, and the sun was of no use at the moment, because some officious person had once explained to Cyril that the sun did not really set in the West at all—nor rise in the East either, for the matter of that. The Psammead had crept out of the bass-bag when they were not looking and had basely deserted them. An enemy was approaching. There would be a fight. People get killed in fights, and the idea of taking part in a fight was one that did not appeal to the children. The man who had brought the news of the enemy still lay panting on the sand. His tongue was hanging out, long and red, like a dog’s. The people of the village were hurriedly filling the gaps in the fence with thorn-bushes from the heap that seemed to have been piled there ready for just such a need. They lifted the cluster-thorns with long poles—much as men at home, nowadays, lift hay with a fork. Jane bit her lip and tried to decide not to cry. Robert felt in his pocket for a toy pistol and loaded it with a pink paper cap. It was his only weapon. Cyril tightened his belt two holes. And Anthea absently took the drooping red roses from the buttonholes of the others, bit the ends of the stalks, and set them in a pot of water that stood in the shadow by a hut door. She was always rather silly about flowers. “Look here!” she said. “I think perhaps the Psammead is really arranging something for us. I don’t believe it would go away and leave us all alone in the Past. I’m certain it wouldn’t.” Jane succeeded in deciding not to cry—at any rate yet. “But what can we do?” Robert asked. “Nothing,” Cyril answered promptly, “except keep our eyes and ears open. Look! That runner chap’s getting his wind. Let’s go and hear what he’s got to say.” The runner had risen to his knees and was sitting back on his heels. Now he stood up and spoke. He began by some respectful remarks addressed to the heads of the village. His speech got more interesting when he said— “I went out in my raft to snare ibises, and I had gone up the stream an hour’s journey. Then I set my snares and waited. And I heard the sound of many wings, and looking up, saw many herons circling in the air. And I saw that they were afraid; so I took thought. A beast may scare one heron, coming upon it suddenly, but no beast will scare a whole flock of herons. And still they flew and circled, and would not light. So then I knew that what scared the herons must be men, and men who knew not our ways of going softly so as to take the birds and beasts unawares. By this I knew they were not of our race or of our place. So, leaving my raft, I crept along the river bank, and at last came upon the strangers. They are many as the sands of the desert, and their spear-heads shine red like the sun. They are a terrible people, and their march is towards us. Having seen this, I ran, and did not stay till I was before you.” “These are  your  folk,” said the headman, turning suddenly and angrily on Cyril, “you came as spies for them.” “We did  not ,” said Cyril indignantly. “We wouldn’t be spies for anything. I’m certain these people aren’t a bit like us. Are they now?” he asked the runner. “No,” was the answer. “These men’s faces were darkened, and their hair black as night. Yet these strange children, maybe, are their gods, who have come before to make ready the way for them.” A murmur ran through the crowd. “No,  no ,” said Cyril again. “We are on your side. We will help you to guard your sacred things.” The headman seemed impressed by the fact that Cyril knew that there  were  sacred things to be guarded. He stood a moment gazing at the children. Then he said— “It is well. And now let all make offering, that we may be strong in battle.” The crowd dispersed, and nine men, wearing antelope-skins, grouped themselves in front of the opening in the hedge in the middle of the village. And presently, one by one, the men brought all sorts of things—hippopotamus flesh, ostrich-feathers, the fruit of the date palms, red chalk, green chalk, fish from the river, and ibex from the mountains; and the headman received these gifts. There was another hedge inside the first, about a yard from it, so that there was a lane inside between the hedges. And every now and then one of the headmen would disappear along this lane with full hands and come back with hands empty. “They’re making offerings to their Amulet,” said Anthea. “We’d better give something too.” The pockets of the party, hastily explored, yielded a piece of pink tape, a bit of sealing-wax, and part of the Waterbury watch that Robert had not been able to help taking to pieces at Christmas and had never had time to rearrange. Most boys have a watch in this condition. They presented their offerings, and Anthea added the red roses. The headman who took the things looked at them with awe, especially at the red roses and the Waterbury-watch fragment. “This is a day of very wondrous happenings,” he said. “I have no more room in me to be astonished. Our maiden said there was peace between you and us. But for this coming of a foe we should have made sure.” The children shuddered. “Now speak. Are you upon our side?” “ Yes . Don’t I keep telling you we are?” Robert said. “Look here. I will give you a sign. You see this.” He held out the toy pistol. “I shall speak to it, and if it answers me you will know that I and the others are come to guard your sacred thing—that we’ve just made the offerings to.” “Will that god whose image you hold in your hand speak to you alone, or shall I also hear it?” asked the man cautiously. “You’ll be surprised when you  do  hear it,” said Robert. “Now, then.” He looked at the pistol and said— “If we are to guard the sacred treasure within”—he pointed to the hedged-in space—“speak with thy loud voice, and we shall obey.” He pulled the trigger, and the cap went off. The noise was loud, for it was a two-shilling pistol, and the caps were excellent. Every man, woman, and child in the village fell on its face on the sand. The headman who had accepted the test rose first. “The voice has spoken,” he said. “Lead them into the ante-room of the sacred thing.” So now the four children were led in through the opening of the hedge and round the lane till they came to an opening in the inner hedge, and they went through an opening in that, and so passed into another lane. The thing was built something like this, and all the hedges were of brushwood and thorns:   “It’s like the maze at Hampton Court,” whispered Anthea. The lanes were all open to the sky, but the little hut in the middle of the maze was round-roofed, and a curtain of skins hung over the doorway. “Here you may wait,” said their guide, “but do not dare to pass the curtain.” He himself passed it and disappeared. “But look here,” whispered Cyril, “some of us ought to be outside in case the Psammead turns up.” “Don’t let’s get separated from each other, whatever we do,” said Anthea. “It’s quite bad enough to be separated from the Psammead. We can’t do anything while that man is in there. Let’s all go out into the village again. We can come back later now we know the way in. That man’ll have to fight like the rest, most likely, if it comes to fighting. If we find the Psammead we’ll go straight home. It must be getting late, and I don’t much like this mazy place.” They went out and told the headman that they would protect the treasure when the fighting began. And now they looked about them and were able to see exactly how a first-class worker in flint flakes and notches an arrow-head or the edge of an axe—an advantage which no other person now alive has ever enjoyed. The boys found the weapons most interesting. The arrow-heads were not on arrows such as you shoot from a bow, but on javelins, for throwing from the hand. The chief weapon was a stone fastened to a rather short stick something like the things gentlemen used to carry about and call life-preservers in the days of the garrotters. Then there were long things like spears or lances, with flint knives—horribly sharp—and flint battle-axes. Everyone in the village was so busy that the place was like an ant-heap when you have walked into it by accident. The women were busy and even the children. Quite suddenly all the air seemed to glow and grow red—it was like the sudden opening of a furnace door, such as you may see at Woolwich Arsenal if you ever have the luck to be taken there—and then almost as suddenly it was as though the furnace doors had been shut. For the sun had set, and it was night. The sun had that abrupt way of setting in Egypt eight thousand years ago, and I believe it has never been able to break itself of the habit, and sets in exactly the same manner to the present day. The girl brought the skins of wild deer and led the children to a heap of dry sedge. “My father says they will not attack yet. Sleep!” she said, and it really seemed a good idea. You may think that in the midst of all these dangers the children would not have been able to sleep—but somehow, though they were rather frightened now and then, the feeling was growing in them—deep down and almost hidden away, but still growing—that the Psammead was to be trusted, and that they were really and truly safe. This did not prevent their being quite as much frightened as they could bear to be without being perfectly miserable. “I suppose we’d better go to sleep,” said Robert. “I don’t know what on earth poor old Nurse will do with us out all night; set the police on our tracks, I expect. I only wish they could find us! A dozen policemen would be rather welcome just now. But it’s no use getting into a stew over it,” he added soothingly. “Good night.” And they all fell asleep. They were awakened by long, loud, terrible sounds that seemed to come from everywhere at once—horrible threatening shouts and shrieks and howls that sounded, as Cyril said later, like the voices of men thirsting for their enemies’ blood. “It is the voice of the strange men,” said the girl, coming to them trembling through the dark. “They have attacked the walls, and the thorns have driven them back. My father says they will not try again till daylight. But they are shouting to frighten us. As though we were savages! Dwellers in the swamps!” she cried indignantly. All night the terrible noise went on, but when the sun rose, as abruptly as he had set, the sound suddenly ceased. The children had hardly time to be glad of this before a shower of javelins came hurtling over the great thorn-hedge, and everyone sheltered behind the huts. But next moment another shower of weapons came from the opposite side, and the crowd rushed to other shelter. Cyril pulled out a javelin that had stuck in the roof of the hut beside him. Its head was of brightly burnished copper. Then the sound of shouting arose again and the crackle of dried thorns. The enemy was breaking down the hedge. All the villagers swarmed to the point whence the crackling and the shouting came; they hurled stones over the hedges, and short arrows with flint heads. The children had never before seen men with the fighting light in their eyes. It was very strange and terrible, and gave you a queer thick feeling in your throat; it was quite different from the pictures of fights in the illustrated papers at home. It seemed that the shower of stones had driven back the besiegers. The besieged drew breath, but at that moment the shouting and the crackling arose on the opposite side of the village and the crowd hastened to defend that point, and so the fight swayed to and fro across the village, for the besieged had not the sense to divide their forces as their enemies had done. Cyril noticed that every now and then certain of the fighting-men would enter the maze, and come out with brighter faces, a braver aspect, and a more upright carriage. “I believe they go and touch the Amulet,” he said. “You know the Psammead said it could make people brave.” They crept through the maze, and watching they saw that Cyril was right. A headman was standing in front of the skin curtain, and as the warriors came before him he murmured a word they could not hear, and touched their foreheads with something that they could not see. And this something he held in his hands. And through his fingers they saw the gleam of a red stone that they knew. The fight raged across the thorn-hedge outside. Suddenly there was a loud and bitter cry. “They’re in! They’re in! The hedge is down!” The headman disappeared behind the deer-skin curtain. “He’s gone to hide it,” said Anthea. “Oh, Psammead dear, how could you leave us!” Suddenly there was a shriek from inside the hut, and the headman staggered out white with fear and fled out through the maze. The children were as white as he. “Oh! What is it? What is it?” moaned Anthea. “Oh, Psammead, how could you! How could you!” And the sound of the fight sank breathlessly, and swelled fiercely all around. It was like the rising and falling of the waves of the sea. Anthea shuddered and said again, “Oh, Psammead, Psammead!” “Well?” said a brisk voice, and the curtain of skins was lifted at one corner by a furry hand, and out peeped the bat’s ears and snail’s eyes of the Psammead. Anthea caught it in her arms and a sigh of desperate relief was breathed by each of the four. “Oh! which  is  the East!” Anthea said, and she spoke hurriedly, for the noise of wild fighting drew nearer and nearer. “Don’t choke me,” said the Psammead, “come inside.” The inside of the hut was pitch dark. “I’ve got a match,” said Cyril, and struck it. The floor of the hut was of soft, loose sand. “I’ve been asleep here,” said the Psammead; “most comfortable it’s been, the best sand I’ve had for a month. It’s all right. Everything’s all right. I knew your only chance would be while the fight was going on. That man won’t come back. I bit him, and he thinks I’m an Evil Spirit. Now you’ve only got to take the thing and go.” The hut was hung with skins. Heaped in the middle were the offerings that had been given the night before, Anthea’s roses fading on the top of the heap. At one side of the hut stood a large square stone block, and on it an oblong box of earthenware with strange figures of men and beasts on it. “Is the thing in there?” asked Cyril, as the Psammead pointed a skinny finger at it. “You must judge of that,” said the Psammead. “The man was just going to bury the box in the sand when I jumped out at him and bit him.” “Light another match, Robert,” said Anthea. “Now, then quick! which is the East?” “Why, where the sun rises, of course!” “But someone told us—” “Oh! they’ll tell you anything!” said the Psammead impatiently, getting into its bass-bag and wrapping itself in its waterproof sheet. “But we can’t see the sun in here, and it isn’t rising anyhow,” said Jane. “How you do waste time!” the Psammead said. “Why, the East’s where the shrine is, of course.  There! ” It pointed to the great stone. And still the shouting and the clash of stone on metal sounded nearer and nearer. The children could hear that the headmen had surrounded the hut to protect their treasure as long as might be from the enemy. But none dare to come in after the Psammead’s sudden fierce biting of the headman. “Now, Jane,” said Cyril, very quickly. “I’ll take the Amulet, you stand ready to hold up the charm, and be sure you don’t let it go as you come through.” He made a step forward, but at that instant a great crackling overhead ended in a blaze of sunlight. The roof had been broken in at one side, and great slabs of it were being lifted off by two spears. As the children trembled and winked in the new light, large dark hands tore down the wall, and a dark face, with a blobby fat nose, looked over the gap. Even at that awful moment Anthea had time to think that it was very like the face of Mr Jacob Absalom, who had sold them the charm in the shop near Charing Cross. “Here is their Amulet,” cried a harsh, strange voice; “it is this that makes them strong to fight and brave to die. And what else have we here—gods or demons?” He glared fiercely at the children, and the whites of his eyes were very white indeed. He had a wet, red copper knife in his teeth. There was not a moment to lose. “Jane,  Jane , QUICK!” cried everyone passionately. Jane with trembling hands held up the charm towards the East, and Cyril spoke the word of power. The Amulet grew to a great arch. Out beyond it was the glaring Egyptian sky, the broken wall, the cruel, dark, big-nosed face with the red, wet knife in its gleaming teeth. Within the arch was the dull, faint, greeny-brown of London grass and trees. “Hold tight, Jane!” Cyril cried, and he dashed through the arch, dragging Anthea and the Psammead after him. Robert followed, clutching Jane. And in the ears of each, as they passed through the arch of the charm, the sound and fury of battle died out suddenly and utterly, and they heard only the low, dull, discontented hum of vast London, and the peeking and patting of the sparrows on the gravel and the voices of the ragged baby children playing Ring-o’-Roses on the yellow trampled grass. And the charm was a little charm again in Jane’s hand, and there was the basket with their dinner and the bathbuns lying just where they had left it. “My hat!” said Cyril, drawing a long breath; “that was something like an adventure.” “It was rather like one, certainly,” said the Psammead. They all lay still, breathing in the safe, quiet air of Regent’s Park. “We’d better go home at once,” said Anthea presently. “Old Nurse will be most frightfully anxious. The sun looks about the same as it did when we started yesterday. We’ve been away twenty-four hours.” “The buns are quite soft still,” said Cyril, feeling one; “I suppose the dew kept them fresh.” They were not hungry, curiously enough. They picked up the dinner-basket and the Psammead-basket, and went straight home. Old Nurse met them with amazement. “Well, if ever I did!” she said. “What’s gone wrong? You’ve soon tired of your picnic.” The children took this to be bitter irony, which means saying the exact opposite of what you mean in order to make yourself disagreeable; as when you happen to have a dirty face, and someone says, “How nice and clean you look!” “We’re very sorry,” began Anthea, but old Nurse said— “Oh, bless me, child, I don’t care! Please yourselves and you’ll please me. Come in and get your dinners comf’table. I’ve got a potato on a-boiling.” When she had gone to attend to the potatoes the children looked at each other. Could it be that old Nurse had so changed that she no longer cared that they should have been away from home for twenty-four hours—all night in fact—without any explanation whatever? But the Psammead put its head out of its basket and said— “What’s the matter? Don’t you understand? You come back through the charm-arch at the same time as you go through it. This isn’t tomorrow!” “Is it still yesterday?” asked Jane. “No, it’s today. The same as it’s always been. It wouldn’t do to go mixing up the present and the Past, and cutting bits out of one to fit into the other.” “Then all that adventure took no time at all?” “You can call it that if you like,” said the Psammead. “It took none of the modern time, anyhow.” That evening Anthea carried up a steak for the learned gentleman’s dinner. She persuaded Beatrice, the maid-of-all-work, who had given her the bangle with the blue stone, to let her do it. And she stayed and talked to him, by special invitation, while he ate the dinner. She told him the whole adventure, beginning with— “This afternoon we found ourselves on the bank of the River Nile,” and ending up with, “And then we remembered how to get back, and there we were in Regent’s Park, and it hadn’t taken any time at all.” She did not tell anything about the charm or the Psammead, because that was forbidden, but the story was quite wonderful enough even as it was to entrance the learned gentleman. “You are a most unusual little girl,” he said. “Who tells you all these things?” “No one,” said Anthea, “they just happen.” “Make-believe,” he said slowly, as one who recalls and pronounces a long-forgotten word. He sat long after she had left him. At last he roused himself with a start. “I really must take a holiday,” he said; “my nerves must be all out of order. I actually have a perfectly distinct impression that the little girl from the rooms below came in and gave me a coherent and graphic picture of life as I conceive it to have been in pre-dynastic Egypt. Strange what tricks the mind will play! I shall have to be more careful.” He finished his bread conscientiously, and actually went for a mile walk before he went back to his work. CHAPTER VI. THE WAY TO BABYLON “How many miles to Babylon?     Three score and ten! Can I get there by candle light?     Yes, and back again!” Jane was singing to her doll, rocking it to and fro in the house which she had made for herself and it. The roof of the house was the dining-table, and the walls were tablecloths and antimacassars hanging all round, and kept in their places by books laid on their top ends at the table edge. The others were tasting the fearful joys of domestic tobogganing. You know how it is done—with the largest and best tea-tray and the surface of the stair carpet. It is best to do it on the days when the stair rods are being cleaned, and the carpet is only held by the nails at the top. Of course, it is one of the five or six thoroughly tip-top games that grown-up people are so unjust to—and old Nurse, though a brick in many respects, was quite enough of a standard grown-up to put her foot down on the tobogganing long before any of the performers had had half enough of it. The tea-tray was taken away, and the baffled party entered the sitting-room, in exactly the mood not to be pleased if they could help it. So Cyril said, “What a beastly mess!” And Robert added, “Do shut up, Jane!” Even Anthea, who was almost always kind, advised Jane to try another song. “I’m sick to death of that,” said she. It was a wet day, so none of the plans for seeing all the sights of London that can be seen for nothing could be carried out. Everyone had been thinking all the morning about the wonderful adventures of the day before, when Jane had held up the charm and it had turned into an arch, through which they had walked straight out of the present time and the Regent’s Park into the land of Egypt eight thousand years ago. The memory of yesterday’s happenings was still extremely fresh and frightening, so that everyone hoped that no one would suggest another excursion into the past, for it seemed to all that yesterday’s adventures were quite enough to last for at least a week. Yet each felt a little anxious that the others should not think it was afraid, and presently Cyril, who really was not a coward, began to see that it would not be at all nice if he should have to think himself one. So he said— “I say—about that charm—Jane—come out. We ought to talk about it, anyhow.” “Oh, if that’s all,” said Robert. Jane obediently wriggled to the front of her house and sat there. She felt for the charm, to make sure that it was still round her neck. “It  isn’t  all,” said Cyril, saying much more than he meant because he thought Robert’s tone had been rude—as indeed it had. “We ought to go and look for that Amulet. What’s the good of having a first-class charm and keeping it idle, just eating its head off in the stable.” “ I’m  game for anything, of course,” said Robert; but he added, with a fine air of chivalry, “only I don’t think the girls are keen today somehow.” “Oh, yes; I am,” said Anthea hurriedly. “If you think I’m afraid, I’m not.” “I am though,” said Jane heavily; “I didn’t like it, and I won’t go there again—not for anything I won’t.” “We shouldn’t go  there  again, silly,” said Cyril; “it would be some other place.” “I daresay; a place with lions and tigers in it as likely as not.” Seeing Jane so frightened, made the others feel quite brave. They said they were certain they ought to go. “It’s so ungrateful to the Psammead not to,” Anthea added, a little primly. Jane stood up. She was desperate. “I won’t!” she cried; “I won’t, I won’t, I won’t! If you make me I’ll scream and I’ll scream, and I’ll tell old Nurse, and I’ll get her to burn the charm in the kitchen fire. So now, then!” You can imagine how furious everyone was with Jane for feeling what each of them had felt all the morning. In each breast the same thought arose, “No one can say it’s  our  fault.” And they at once began to show Jane how angry they all felt that all the fault was hers. This made them feel quite brave. “Tell-tale tit, its tongue shall be split, And all the dogs in our town shall have a little bit,” sang Robert. “It’s always the way if you have girls in anything.” Cyril spoke in a cold displeasure that was worse than Robert’s cruel quotation, and even Anthea said, “Well,  I’m  not afraid if I  am  a girl,” which of course, was the most cutting thing of all. Jane picked up her doll and faced the others with what is sometimes called the courage of despair. “I don’t care,” she said; “I  won’t , so there! It’s just silly going to places when you don’t want to, and when you don’t know what they’re going to be like! You can laugh at me as much as you like. You’re beasts—and I hate you all!” With these awful words she went out and banged the door. Then the others would not look at each other, and they did not feel so brave as they had done. Cyril took up a book, but it was not interesting to read. Robert kicked a chair-leg absently. His feet were always eloquent in moments of emotion. Anthea stood pleating the end of the tablecloth into folds—she seemed earnestly anxious to get all the pleats the same size. The sound of Jane’s sobs had died away. Suddenly Anthea said, “Oh! let it be ‘pax’—poor little Pussy—you know she’s the youngest.” “She called us beasts,” said Robert, kicking the chair suddenly. “Well,” said Cyril, who was subject to passing fits of justice, “we began, you know. At least you did.” Cyril’s justice was always uncompromising. “I’m not going to say I’m sorry if you mean that,” said Robert, and the chair-leg cracked to the kick he gave as he said it. “Oh, do let’s,” said Anthea, “we’re three to one, and Mother does so hate it if we row. Come on. I’ll say I’m sorry first, though I didn’t say anything, hardly.” “All right, let’s get it over,” said Cyril, opening the door.“Hi—you—Pussy!” Far away up the stairs a voice could be heard singing brokenly, but still defiantly— “How many miles (sniff) to Babylon?     Three score and ten! (sniff) Can I get there by candle light?     Yes (sniff), and back again!” It was trying, for this was plainly meant to annoy. But Anthea would not give herself time to think this. She led the way up the stairs, taking three at a time, and bounded to the level of Jane, who sat on the top step of all, thumping her doll to the tune of the song she was trying to sing. “I say, Pussy, let it be pax! We’re sorry if you are—” It was enough. The kiss of peace was given by all. Jane being the youngest was entitled to this ceremonial. Anthea added a special apology of her own. “I’m sorry if I was a pig, Pussy dear,” she said—“especially because in my really and truly inside mind I’ve been feeling a little as if I’d rather not go into the Past again either. But then, do think. If we don’t go we shan’t get the Amulet, and oh, Pussy, think if we could only get Father and Mother and The Lamb safe back! We  must  go, but we’ll wait a day or two if you like and then perhaps you’ll feel braver.” “Raw meat makes you brave, however cowardly you are,” said Robert, to show that there was now no ill-feeling, “and cranberries—that’s what Tartars eat, and they’re so brave it’s simply awful. I suppose cranberries are only for Christmas time, but I’ll ask old Nurse to let you have your chop very raw if you like.” “I think I could be brave without that,” said Jane hastily; she hated underdone meat. “I’ll try.” At this moment the door of the learned gentleman’s room opened, and he looked out. “Excuse me,” he said, in that gentle, polite weary voice of his, “but was I mistaken in thinking that I caught a familiar word just now? Were you not singing some old ballad of Babylon?” “No,” said Robert, “at least Jane was singing ‘How many miles,’ but I shouldn’t have thought you could have heard the words for—” He would have said, “for the sniffing,” but Anthea pinched him just in time. “I did not hear  all  the words,” said the learned gentleman. “I wonder would you recite them to me?” So they all said together— “How many miles to Babylon?     Three score and ten! Can I get there by candle light?     Yes, and back again!” “I wish one could,” the learned gentleman said with a sigh. “Can’t you?” asked Jane. “Babylon has fallen,” he answered with a sigh. “You know it was once a great and beautiful city, and the centre of learning and Art, and now it is only ruins, and so covered up with earth that people are not even agreed as to where it once stood.” He was leaning on the banisters, and his eyes had a far-away look in them, as though he could see through the staircase window the splendour and glory of ancient Babylon. “I say,” Cyril remarked abruptly. “You know that charm we showed you, and you told us how to say the name that’s on it?” “Yes!” “Well, do you think that charm was ever in Babylon?” “It’s quite possible,” the learned gentleman replied. “Such charms have been found in very early Egyptian tombs, yet their origin has not been accurately determined as Egyptian. They may have been brought from Asia. Or, supposing the charm to have been fashioned in Egypt, it might very well have been carried to Babylon by some friendly embassy, or brought back by the Babylonish army from some Egyptian campaign as part of the spoils of war. The inscription may be much later than the charm. Oh yes! it is a pleasant fancy, that that splendid specimen of yours was once used amid Babylonish surroundings.” The others looked at each other, but it was Jane who spoke. “Were the Babylon people savages, were they always fighting and throwing things about?” For she had read the thoughts of the others by the unerring light of her own fears. “The Babylonians were certainly more gentle than the Assyrians,” said the learned gentleman. “And they were not savages by any means. A very high level of culture,” he looked doubtfully at his audience and went on, “I mean that they made beautiful statues and jewellery, and built splendid palaces. And they were very learned—they had glorious libraries and high towers for the purpose of astrological and astronomical observation.” “Er?” said Robert. “I mean for—star-gazing and fortune-telling,” said the learned gentleman, “and there were temples and beautiful hanging gardens—” “I’ll go to Babylon if you like,” said Jane abruptly, and the others hastened to say “Done!” before she should have time to change her mind. “Ah,” said the learned gentleman, smiling rather sadly, “one can go so far in dreams, when one is young.” He sighed again, and then adding with a laboured briskness, “I hope you’ll have a—a—jolly game,” he went into his room and shut the door. “He said ‘jolly’ as if it was a foreign language,” said Cyril. “Come on, let’s get the Psammead and go now. I think Babylon seems a most frightfully jolly place to go to.” So they woke the Psammead and put it in its bass-bag with the waterproof sheet, in case of inclement weather in Babylon. It was very cross, but it said it would as soon go to Babylon as anywhere else. “The sand is good thereabouts,” it added. Then Jane held up the charm, and Cyril said— “We want to go to Babylon to look for the part of you that was lost. Will you please let us go there through you?” “Please put us down just outside,” said Jane hastily; “and then if we don’t like it we needn’t go inside.” “Don’t be all day,” said the Psammead. So Anthea hastily uttered the word of power, without which the charm could do nothing. “Ur—Hekau—Setcheh!” she said softly, and as she spoke the charm grew into an arch so tall that the top of it was close against the bedroom ceiling. Outside the arch was the bedroom painted chest-of-drawers and the Kidderminster carpet, and the washhand-stand with the riveted willow-pattern jug, and the faded curtains, and the dull light of indoors on a wet day. Through the arch showed the gleam of soft green leaves and white blossoms. They stepped forward quite happily. Even Jane felt that this did not look like lions, and her hand hardly trembled at all as she held the charm for the others to go through, and last, slipped through herself, and hung the charm, now grown small again, round her neck. The children found themselves under a white-blossomed, green-leafed fruit-tree, in what seemed to be an orchard of such trees, all white-flowered and green-foliaged. Among the long green grass under their feet grew crocuses and lilies, and strange blue flowers. In the branches overhead thrushes and blackbirds were singing, and the coo of a pigeon came softly to them in the green quietness of the orchard. “Oh, how perfectly lovely!” cried Anthea. “Why, it’s like home exactly—I mean England—only everything’s bluer, and whiter, and greener, and the flowers are bigger.” The boys owned that it certainly was fairly decent, and even Jane admitted that it was all very pretty. “I’m certain there’s nothing to be frightened of here,” said Anthea. “I don’t know,” said Jane. “I suppose the fruit-trees go on just the same even when people are killing each other. I didn’t half like what the learned gentleman said about the hanging gardens. I suppose they have gardens on purpose to hang people in. I do hope this isn’t one.” “Of course it isn’t,” said Cyril. “The hanging gardens are just gardens hung up— I  think on chains between houses, don’t you know, like trays. Come on; let’s get somewhere.” They began to walk through the cool grass. As far as they could see was nothing but trees, and trees and more trees. At the end of their orchard was another one, only separated from theirs by a little stream of clear water. They jumped this, and went on. Cyril, who was fond of gardening—which meant that he liked to watch the gardener at work—was able to command the respect of the others by telling them the names of a good many trees. There were nut-trees and almond-trees, and apricots, and fig-trees with their big five-fingered leaves. And every now and then the children had to cross another brook. “It’s like between the squares in  Through the Looking-glass ,” said Anthea. At last they came to an orchard which was quite different from the other orchards. It had a low building in one corner. “These are vines,” said Cyril superiorly, “and I know this is a vineyard. I shouldn’t wonder if there was a wine-press inside that place over there.” At last they got out of the orchards and on to a sort of road, very rough, and not at all like the roads you are used to. It had cypress trees and acacia trees along it, and a sort of hedge of tamarisks, like those you see on the road between Nice and Cannes, or near Littlehampton, if you’ve only been as far as that. And now in front of them they could see a great mass of buildings. There were scattered houses of wood and stone here and there among green orchards, and beyond these a great wall that shone red in the early morning sun. The wall was enormously high—more than half the height of St Paul’s—and in the wall were set enormous gates that shone like gold as the rising sun beat on them. Each gate had a solid square tower on each side of it that stood out from the wall and rose above it. Beyond the wall were more towers and houses, gleaming with gold and bright colours. Away to the left ran the steel-blue swirl of a great river. And the children could see, through a gap in the trees, that the river flowed out from the town under a great arch in the wall. “Those feathery things along by the water are palms,” said Cyril instructively. “Oh, yes; you know everything,” Robert replied. “What’s all that grey-green stuff you see away over there, where it’s all flat and sandy?” “All right,” said Cyril loftily, “ I  don’t want to tell you anything. I only thought you’d like to know a palm-tree when you saw it again.” “Look!” cried Anthea; “they’re opening the gates.” And indeed the great gates swung back with a brazen clang, and instantly a little crowd of a dozen or more people came out and along the road towards them. The children, with one accord, crouched behind the tamarisk hedge. “I don’t like the sound of those gates,” said Jane. “Fancy being inside when they shut. You’d never get out.” “You’ve got an arch of your own to go out by,” the Psammead put its head out of the basket to remind her. “Don’t behave so like a girl. If I were you I should just march right into the town and ask to see the king.” There was something at once simple and grand about this idea, and it pleased everyone. So when the work-people had passed (they  were  work-people, the children felt sure, because they were dressed so plainly—just one long blue shirt thing—of blue or yellow) the four children marched boldly up to the brazen gate between the towers. The arch above the gate was quite a tunnel, the walls were so thick. “Courage,” said Cyril. “Step out. It’s no use trying to sneak past. Be bold!” Robert answered this appeal by unexpectedly bursting into “The British Grenadiers”, and to its quick-step they approached the gates of Babylon. “Some talk of Alexander,     And some of Hercules, Of Hector and Lysander,     And such great names as these. But of all the gallant heroes...” This brought them to the threshold of the gate, and two men in bright armour suddenly barred their way with crossed spears. “Who goes there?” they said. (I think I must have explained to you before how it was that the children were always able to understand the language of any place they might happen to be in, and to be themselves understood. If not, I have no time to explain it now.) “We come from very far,” said Cyril mechanically. “From the Empire where the sun never sets, and we want to see your King.” “If it’s quite convenient,” amended Anthea. “The King (may he live for ever!),” said the gatekeeper, “is gone to fetch home his fourteenth wife. Where on earth have you come from not to know that?” “The Queen then,” said Anthea hurriedly, and not taking any notice of the question as to where they had come from. “The Queen,” said the gatekeeper, “(may she live for ever!) gives audience today three hours after sunrising.” “But what are we to do till the end of the three hours?” asked Cyril. The gatekeeper seemed neither to know nor to care. He appeared less interested in them than they could have thought possible. But the man who had crossed spears with him to bar the children’s way was more human. “Let them go in and look about them,” he said. “I’ll wager my best sword they’ve never seen anything to come near our little—village.” He said it in the tone people use for when they call the Atlantic Ocean the “herring pond”. The gatekeeper hesitated. “They’re only children, after all,” said the other, who had children of his own. “Let me off for a few minutes, Captain, and I’ll take them to my place and see if my good woman can’t fit them up in something a little less outlandish than their present rig. Then they can have a look round without being mobbed. May I go?” “Oh yes, if you like,” said the Captain, “but don’t be all day.” The man led them through the dark arch into the town. And it was very different from London. For one thing, everything in London seems to be patched up out of odds and ends, but these houses seemed to have been built by people who liked the same sort of things. Not that they were all alike, for though all were squarish, they were of different sizes, and decorated in all sorts of different ways, some with paintings in bright colours, some with black and silver designs. There were terraces, and gardens, and balconies, and open spaces with trees. Their guide took them to a little house in a back street, where a kind-faced woman sat spinning at the door of a very dark room. “Here,” he said, “just lend these children a mantle each, so that they can go about and see the place till the Queen’s audience begins. You leave that wool for a bit, and show them round if you like. I must be off now.” The woman did as she was told, and the four children, wrapped in fringed mantles, went with her all about the town, and oh! how I wish I had time to tell you all that they saw. It was all so wonderfully different from anything you have ever seen. For one thing, all the houses were dazzlingly bright, and many of them covered with pictures. Some had great creatures carved in stone at each side of the door. Then the people—there were no black frock-coats and tall hats; no dingy coats and skirts of good, useful, ugly stuffs warranted to wear. Everyone’s clothes were bright and beautiful with blue and scarlet and green and gold. The market was brighter than you would think anything could be. There were stalls for everything you could possibly want—and for a great many things that if you wanted here and now, want would be your master. There were pineapples and peaches in heaps—and stalls of crockery and glass things, beautiful shapes and glorious colours, there were stalls for necklaces, and clasps, and bracelets, and brooches, for woven stuffs, and furs, and embroidered linen. The children had never seen half so many beautiful things together, even at Liberty’s. It seemed no time at all before the woman said— “It’s nearly time now. We ought to be getting on towards the palace. It’s as well to be early.” So they went to the palace, and when they got there it was more splendid than anything they had seen yet. For it was glowing with colours, and with gold and silver and black and white—like some magnificent embroidery. Flight after flight of broad marble steps led up to it, and at the edges of the stairs stood great images, twenty times as big as a man—images of men with wings like chain armour, and hawks’ heads, and winged men with the heads of dogs. And there were the statues of great kings. Between the flights of steps were terraces where fountains played, and the Queen’s Guard in white and scarlet, and armour that shone like gold, stood by twos lining the way up the stairs; and a great body of them was massed by the vast door of the palace itself, where it stood glittering like an impossibly radiant peacock in the noon-day sun. All sorts of people were passing up the steps to seek audience of the Queen. Ladies in richly-embroidered dresses with fringy flounces, poor folks in plain and simple clothes, dandies with beards oiled and curled. And Cyril, Robert, Anthea and Jane, went with the crowd. At the gate of the palace the Psammead put one eye cautiously out of the basket and whispered— “I can’t be bothered with queens. I’ll go home with this lady. I’m sure she’ll get me some sand if you ask her to.” “Oh! don’t leave us,” said Jane. The woman was giving some last instructions in Court etiquette to Anthea, and did not hear Jane. “Don’t be a little muff,” said the Psammead quite fiercely. “It’s not a bit of good your having a charm. You never use it. If you want me you’ve only got to say the name of power and ask the charm to bring me to you.” “I’d rather go with you,” said Jane. And it was the most surprising thing she had ever said in her life. Everyone opened its mouth without thinking of manners, and Anthea, who was peeping into the Psammead’s basket, saw that its mouth opened wider than anybody’s. “You needn’t gawp like that,” Jane went on. “I’m not going to be bothered with queens any more than IT is. And I know, wherever it is, it’ll take jolly good care that it’s safe.” “She’s right there,” said everyone, for they had observed that the Psammead had a way of knowing which side its bread was buttered. She turned to the woman and said, “You’ll take me home with you, won’t you? And let me play with your little girls till the others have done with the Queen.” “Surely I will, little heart!” said the woman. And then Anthea hurriedly stroked the Psammead and embraced Jane, who took the woman’s hand, and trotted contentedly away with the Psammead’s bag under the other arm. The others stood looking after her till she, the woman, and the basket were lost in the many-coloured crowd. Then Anthea turned once more to the palace’s magnificent doorway and said— “Let’s ask the porter to take care of our Babylonian overcoats.” So they took off the garments that the woman had lent them and stood amid the jostling petitioners of the Queen in their own English frocks and coats and hats and boots. “We want to see the Queen,” said Cyril; “we come from the far Empire where the sun never sets!” A murmur of surprise and a thrill of excitement ran through the crowd. The door-porter spoke to a black man, he spoke to someone else. There was a whispering, waiting pause. Then a big man, with a cleanly-shaven face, beckoned them from the top of a flight of red marble steps. They went up; the boots of Robert clattering more than usual because he was so nervous. A door swung open, a curtain was drawn back. A double line of bowing forms in gorgeous raiment formed a lane that led to the steps of the throne, and as the children advanced hurriedly there came from the throne a voice very sweet and kind. “Three children from the land where the sun never sets! Let them draw hither without fear.” In another minute they were kneeling at the throne’s foot, saying, “O Queen, live for ever!” exactly as the woman had taught them. And a splendid dream-lady, all gold and silver and jewels and snowy drift of veils, was raising Anthea, and saying— “Don’t be frightened, I really am  so  glad you came! The land where the sun never sets! I am delighted to see you! I was getting quite too dreadfully bored for anything!” And behind Anthea the kneeling Cyril whispered in the ears of the respectful Robert— “Bobs, don’t say anything to Panther. It’s no use upsetting her, but we didn’t ask for Jane’s address, and the Psammead’s with her.” “Well,” whispered Robert, “the charm can bring them to us at any moment.  It  said so.” “Oh, yes,” whispered Cyril, in miserable derision, “ we’re  all right, of course. So we are! Oh, yes! If we’d only  got  the charm.” Then Robert saw, and he murmured, “Crikey!” at the foot of the throne of Babylon; while Cyril hoarsely whispered the plain English fact— “Jane’s got the charm round her neck, you silly cuckoo.” “Crikey!” Robert repeated in heart-broken undertones. CHAPTER VII. “THE DEEPEST DUNGEON BELOW THE CASTLE MOAT” The Queen threw three of the red and gold embroidered cushions off the throne on to the marble steps that led up to it. “Just make yourselves comfortable there,” she said. “I’m simply dying to talk to you, and to hear all about your wonderful country and how you got here, and everything, but I have to do justice every morning. Such a bore, isn’t it? Do you do justice in your own country?” “No,” said Cyril; “at least of course we try to, but not in this public sort of way, only in private.” “Ah, yes,” said the Queen, “I should much prefer a private audience myself—much easier to manage. But public opinion has to be considered. Doing justice is very hard work, even when you’re brought up to it.” “We don’t do justice, but we have to do scales, Jane and me,” said Anthea, “twenty minutes a day. It’s simply horrid.” “What are scales?” asked the Queen, “and what is Jane?” “Jane is my little sister. One of the guards-at-the-gate’s wife is taking care of her. And scales are music.” “I never heard of the instrument,” said the Queen. “Do you sing?” “Oh, yes. We can sing in parts,” said Anthea. “That  is  magic,” said the Queen. “How many parts are you each cut into before you do it?” “We aren’t cut at all,” said Robert hastily. “We couldn’t sing if we were. We’ll show you afterwards.” “So you shall, and now sit quiet like dear children and hear me do justice. The way I do it has always been admired. I oughtn’t to say that, ought I? Sounds so conceited. But I don’t mind with you, dears. Somehow I feel as though I’d known you quite a long time already.” The Queen settled herself on her throne and made a signal to her attendants. The children, whispering together among the cushions on the steps of the throne, decided that she was very beautiful and very kind, but perhaps just the least bit flighty. The first person who came to ask for justice was a woman whose brother had taken the money the father had left for her. The brother said it was the uncle who had the money. There was a good deal of talk and the children were growing rather bored, when the Queen suddenly clapped her hands, and said— “Put both the men in prison till one of them owns up that the other is innocent.” “But suppose they both did it?” Cyril could not help interrupting. “Then prison’s the best place for them,” said the Queen. “But suppose neither did it.” “That’s impossible,” said the Queen; “a thing’s not done unless someone does it. And you mustn’t interrupt.” Then came a woman, in tears, with a torn veil and real ashes on her head—at least Anthea thought so, but it may have been only road-dust. She complained that her husband was in prison. “What for?” said the Queen. “They  said  it was for speaking evil of your Majesty,” said the woman, “but it wasn’t. Someone had a spite against him. That was what it was.” “How do you know he hadn’t spoken evil of me?” said the Queen. “No one could,” said the woman simply, “when they’d once seen your beautiful face.” “Let the man out,” said the Queen, smiling. “Next case.” The next case was that of a boy who had stolen a fox. “Like the Spartan boy,” whispered Robert. But the Queen ruled that nobody could have any possible reason for owning a fox, and still less for stealing one. And she did not believe that there were any foxes in Babylon; she, at any rate, had never seen one. So the boy was released. The people came to the Queen about all sorts of family quarrels and neighbourly misunderstandings—from a fight between brothers over the division of an inheritance, to the dishonest and unfriendly conduct of a woman who had borrowed a cooking-pot at the last New Year’s festival, and not returned it yet. And the Queen decided everything, very, very decidedly indeed. At last she clapped her hands quite suddenly and with extreme loudness, and said— “The audience is over for today.” Everyone said, “May the Queen live for ever!” and went out. And the children were left alone in the justice-hall with the Queen of Babylon and her ladies. “There!” said the Queen, with a long sigh of relief. “ That’s  over! I couldn’t have done another stitch of justice if you’d offered me the crown of Egypt! Now come into the garden, and we’ll have a nice, long, cosy talk.” She led them through long, narrow corridors whose walls they somehow felt, were very, very thick, into a sort of garden courtyard. There were thick shrubs closely planted, and roses were trained over trellises, and made a pleasant shade—needed, indeed, for already the sun was as hot as it is in England in August at the seaside. Slaves spread cushions on a low, marble terrace, and a big man with a smooth face served cool drink in cups of gold studded with beryls. He drank a little from the Queen’s cup before handing it to her. “That’s rather a nasty trick,” whispered Robert, who had been carefully taught never to drink out of one of the nice, shiny, metal cups that are chained to the London drinking fountains without first rinsing it out thoroughly. The Queen overheard him. “Not at all,” said she. “Ritti-Marduk is a very clean man. And one has to have  someone  as taster, you know, because of poison.” The word made the children feel rather creepy; but Ritti-Marduk had tasted all the cups, so they felt pretty safe. The drink was delicious—very cold, and tasting like lemonade and partly like penny ices. “Leave us,” said the Queen. And all the Court ladies, in their beautiful, many-folded, many-coloured, fringed dresses, filed out slowly, and the children were left alone with the Queen. “Now,” she said, “tell me all about yourselves.” They looked at each other. “You, Bobs,” said Cyril. “No—Anthea,” said Robert. “No—you—Cyril,” said Anthea. “Don’t you remember how pleased the Queen of India was when you told her all about us?” Cyril muttered that it was all very well, and so it was. For when he had told the tale of the Phœnix and the Carpet to the Ranee, it had been only the truth—and all the truth that he had to tell. But now it was not easy to tell a convincing story without mentioning the Amulet—which, of course, it wouldn’t have done to mention—and without owning that they were really living in London, about 2,500 years later than the time they were talking in. Cyril took refuge in the tale of the Psammead and its wonderful power of making wishes come true. The children had never been able to tell anyone before, and Cyril was surprised to find that the spell which kept them silent in London did not work here. “Something to do with our being in the Past, I suppose,” he said to himself. “This is  most  interesting,” said the Queen. “We must have this Psammead for the banquet tonight. Its performance will be one of the most popular turns in the whole programme. Where is it?” Anthea explained that they did not know; also why it was that they did not know. “Oh,  that’s  quite simple,” said the Queen, and everyone breathed a deep sigh of relief as she said it. “Ritti-Marduk shall run down to the gates and find out which guard your sister went home with.” “Might he”—Anthea’s voice was tremulous—“might he—would it interfere with his meal-times, or anything like that, if he went  now? ” “Of course he shall go now. He may think himself lucky if he gets his meals at any time,” said the Queen heartily, and clapped her hands. “May I send a letter?” asked Cyril, pulling out a red-backed penny account-book, and feeling in his pockets for a stump of pencil that he  knew  was in one of them. “By all means. I’ll call my scribe.” “Oh, I can scribe right enough, thanks,” said Cyril, finding the pencil and licking its point. He even had to bite the wood a little, for it was very blunt. “Oh, you clever, clever boy!” said the Queen. “ do  let me watch you do it!” Cyril wrote on a leaf of the book—it was of rough, woolly paper, with hairs that stuck out and would have got in his pen if he had been using one, and ruled for accounts. “Hide IT most carefully before you come here,” he wrote, “and don’t mention it—and destroy this letter. Everything is going A1. The Queen is a fair treat. There’s nothing to be afraid of.” “What curious characters, and what a strange flat surface!” said the Queen. “What have you inscribed?” “I’ve “scribed,” replied Cyril cautiously, “that you are fair, and a—and like a—like a festival; and that she need not be afraid, and that she is to come at once.” Ritti-Marduk, who had come in and had stood waiting while Cyril wrote, his Babylonish eyes nearly starting out of his Babylonish head, now took the letter, with some reluctance. “O Queen, live for ever! Is it a charm?” he timidly asked. “A strong charm, most great lady?” “ Yes ,” said Robert, unexpectedly, “it  is  a charm, but it won’t hurt anyone until you’ve given it to Jane. And then she’ll destroy it, so that it  can’t  hurt anyone. It’s most awful strong!—as strong as—Peppermint!” he ended abruptly. “I know not the god,” said Ritti-Marduk, bending timorously. “She’ll tear it up directly she gets it,” said Robert, “That’ll end the charm. You needn’t be afraid if you go now.” Ritti-Marduk went, seeming only partly satisfied; and then the Queen began to admire the penny account-book and the bit of pencil in so marked and significant a way that Cyril felt he could not do less than press them upon her as a gift. She ruffled the leaves delightedly. “What a wonderful substance!” she said. “And with this style you make charms? Make a charm for me! Do you know,” her voice sank to a whisper, “the names of the great ones of your own far country?” “Rather!” said Cyril, and hastily wrote the names of Alfred the Great, Shakespeare, Nelson, Gordon, Lord Beaconsfield, Mr Rudyard Kipling, and Mr Sherlock Holmes, while the Queen watched him with “unbaited breath”, as Anthea said afterwards. She took the book and hid it reverently among the bright folds of her gown. “You shall teach me later to say the great names,” she said. “And the names of their Ministers—perhaps the great Nisroch is one of them?” “I don’t think so,” said Cyril. “Mr Campbell Bannerman’s Prime Minister and Mr Burns a Minister, and so is the Archbishop of Canterbury, I think, but I’m not sure—and Dr Parker was one, I know, and—” “No more,” said the Queen, putting her hands to her ears. “My head’s going round with all those great names. You shall teach them to me later—because of course you’ll make us a nice long visit now you have come, won’t you? Now tell me—but no, I am quite tired out with your being so clever. Besides, I’m sure you’d like  me  to tell  you  something, wouldn’t you?” “Yes,” said Anthea. “I want to know how it is that the King has gone—” “Excuse me, but you should say ‘the King may-he-live-for-ever’,” said the Queen gently. “I beg your pardon,” Anthea hastened to say—“the King may-he-live-for-ever has gone to fetch home his fourteenth wife? I don’t think even Bluebeard had as many as that. And, besides, he hasn’t killed  you  at any rate.” The Queen looked bewildered. “She means,” explained Robert, “that English kings only have one wife—at least, Henry the Eighth had seven or eight, but not all at once.” “In our country,” said the Queen scornfully, “a king would not reign a day who had only one wife. No one would respect him, and quite right too.” “Then are all the other thirteen alive?” asked Anthea. “Of course they are—poor mean-spirited things! I don’t associate with them, of course, I am the Queen: they’re only the wives.” “I see,” said Anthea, gasping. “But oh, my dears,” the Queen went on, “such a to-do as there’s been about this last wife! You never did! It really was  too  funny. We wanted an Egyptian princess. The King may-he-live-for-ever has got a wife from most of the important nations, and he had set his heart on an Egyptian one to complete his collection. Well, of course, to begin with, we sent a handsome present of gold. The Egyptian king sent back some horses—quite a few; he’s fearfully stingy!—and he said he liked the gold very much, but what they were really short of was lapis lazuli, so of course we sent him some. But by that time he’d begun to use the gold to cover the beams of the roof of the Temple of the Sun-God, and he hadn’t nearly enough to finish the job, so we sent some more. And so it went on, oh, for years. You see each journey takes at least six months. And at last we asked the hand of his daughter in marriage.” “Yes, and then?” said Anthea, who wanted to get to the princess part of the story. “Well, then,” said the Queen, “when he’d got everything out of us that he could, and only given the meanest presents in return, he sent to say he would esteem the honour of an alliance very highly, only unfortunately he hadn’t any daughter, but he hoped one would be born soon, and if so, she should certainly be reserved for the King of Babylon!” “What a trick!” said Cyril. “Yes, wasn’t it? So then we said his sister would do, and then there were more gifts and more journeys; and now at last the tiresome, black-haired thing is coming, and the King may-he-live-for-ever has gone seven days’ journey to meet her at Carchemish. And he’s gone in his best chariot, the one inlaid with lapis lazuli and gold, with the gold-plated wheels and onyx-studded hubs—much too great an honour in my opinion. She’ll be here tonight; there’ll be a grand banquet to celebrate her arrival.  She  won’t be present, of course. She’ll be having her baths and her anointings, and all that sort of thing. We always clean our foreign brides very carefully. It takes two or three weeks. Now it’s dinnertime, and you shall eat with me, for I can see that you are of high rank.” She led them into a dark, cool hall, with many cushions on the floor. On these they sat and low tables were brought—beautiful tables of smooth, blue stone mounted in gold. On these, golden trays were placed; but there were no knives, or forks, or spoons. The children expected the Queen to call for them; but no. She just ate with her fingers, and as the first dish was a great tray of boiled corn, and meat and raisins all mixed up together, and melted fat poured all over the tray, it was found difficult to follow her example with anything like what we are used to think of as good table manners. There were stewed quinces afterwards, and dates in syrup, and thick yellowy cream. It was the kind of dinner you hardly ever get in Fitzroy Street. After dinner everybody went to sleep, even the children. The Queen awoke with a start. “Good gracious!” she cried, “what a time we’ve slept! I must rush off and dress for the banquet. I shan’t have much more than time.” “Hasn’t Ritti-Marduk got back with our sister and the Psammead yet?” Anthea asked. “I  quite  forgot to ask. I’m sorry,” said the Queen. “And of course they wouldn’t announce her unless I told them to, except during justice hours. I expect she’s waiting outside. I’ll see.” Ritti-Marduk came in a moment later. “I regret,” he said, “that I have been unable to find your sister. The beast she bears with her in a basket has bitten the child of the guard, and your sister and the beast set out to come to you. The police say they have a clue. No doubt we shall have news of her in a few weeks.” He bowed and withdrew. The horror of this threefold loss—Jane, the Psammead, and the Amulet—gave the children something to talk about while the Queen was dressing. I shall not report their conversation; it was very gloomy. Everyone repeated himself several times, and the discussion ended in each of them blaming the other two for having let Jane go. You know the sort of talk it was, don’t you? At last Cyril said— “After all, she’s with the Psammead, so  she’s  all right. The Psammead is jolly careful of itself too. And it isn’t as if we were in any danger. Let’s try to buck up and enjoy the banquet.” They did enjoy the banquet. They had a beautiful bath, which was delicious, were heavily oiled all over, including their hair, and that was most unpleasant. Then, they dressed again and were presented to the King, who was most affable. The banquet was long; there were all sorts of nice things to eat, and everybody seemed to eat and drink a good deal. Everyone lay on cushions and couches, ladies on one side and gentlemen on the other; and after the eating was done each lady went and sat by some gentleman, who seemed to be her sweetheart or her husband, for they were very affectionate to each other. The Court dresses had gold threads woven in them, very bright and beautiful. The middle of the room was left clear, and different people came and did amusing things. There were conjurers and jugglers and snake-charmers, which last Anthea did not like at all. When it got dark torches were lighted. Cedar splinters dipped in oil blazed in copper dishes set high on poles. Then there was a dancer, who hardly danced at all, only just struck attitudes. She had hardly any clothes, and was not at all pretty. The children were rather bored by her, but everyone else was delighted, including the King. “By the beard of Nimrod!” he cried, “ask what you like girl, and you shall have it!” “I want nothing,” said the dancer; “the honour of having pleased the King may-he-live-for-ever is reward enough for me.” And the King was so pleased with this modest and sensible reply that he gave her the gold collar off his own neck. “I say!” said Cyril, awed by the magnificence of the gift. “It’s all right,” whispered the Queen, “it’s not his best collar by any means. We always keep a stock of cheap jewellery for these occasions. And now—you promised to sing us something. Would you like my minstrels to accompany you?” “No, thank you,” said Anthea quickly. The minstrels had been playing off and on all the time, and their music reminded Anthea of the band she and the others had once had on the fifth of November—with penny horns, a tin whistle, a tea-tray, the tongs, a policeman’s rattle, and a toy drum. They had enjoyed this band very much at the time. But it was quite different when someone else was making the same kind of music. Anthea understood now that Father had not been really heartless and unreasonable when he had told them to stop that infuriating din. “What shall we sing?” Cyril was asking. “Sweet and low?” suggested Anthea. “Too soft—I vote for ‘Who will o’er the downs’. Now then—one, two, three. “Oh, who will o’er the downs so free,     Oh, who will with me ride, Oh, who will up and follow me,     To win a blooming bride? Her father he has locked the door,     Her mother keeps the key; But neither bolt nor bar shall keep     My own true love from me.” Jane, the alto, was missing, and Robert, unlike the mother of the lady in the song, never could “keep the key”, but the song, even so, was sufficiently unlike anything any of them had ever heard to rouse the Babylonian Court to the wildest enthusiasm. “More, more,” cried the King; “by my beard, this savage music is a new thing. Sing again!” So they sang: “I saw her bower at twilight gray,     ’Twas guarded safe and sure. I saw her bower at break of day,     ’Twas guarded then no more. The varlets they were all asleep,     And there was none to see The greeting fair that passed there     Between my love and me.” Shouts of applause greeted the ending of the verse, and the King would not be satisfied till they had sung all their part-songs (they only knew three) twice over, and ended up with “Men of Harlech” in unison. Then the King stood up in his royal robes with his high, narrow crown on his head and shouted— “By the beak of Nisroch, ask what you will, strangers from the land where the sun never sets!” “We ought to say it’s enough honour, like the dancer did,” whispered Anthea. “No, let’s ask for  It ,” said Robert. “No, no, I’m sure the other’s manners,” said Anthea. But Robert, who was excited by the music, and the flaring torches, and the applause and the opportunity, spoke up before the others could stop him. “Give us the half of the Amulet that has on it the name UR HEKAU SETCHEH,” he said, adding as an afterthought, “O King, live-for-ever.” As he spoke the great name those in the pillared hall fell on their faces, and lay still. All but the Queen who crouched amid her cushions with her head in her hands, and the King, who stood upright, perfectly still, like the statue of a king in stone. It was only for a moment though. Then his great voice thundered out— “Guard, seize them!” Instantly, from nowhere as it seemed, sprang eight soldiers in bright armour inlaid with gold, and tunics of red and white. Very splendid they were, and very alarming. “Impious and sacrilegious wretches!” shouted the King. “To the dungeons with them! We will find a way, tomorrow, to make them speak. For without doubt they can tell us where to find the lost half of  It .” A wall of scarlet and white and steel and gold closed up round the children and hurried them away among the many pillars of the great hall. As they went they heard the voices of the courtiers loud in horror. “You’ve done it this time,” said Cyril with extreme bitterness. “Oh, it will come right. It  must . It always does,” said Anthea desperately. They could not see where they were going, because the guard surrounded them so closely, but the ground under their feet, smooth marble at first, grew rougher like stone, then it was loose earth and sand, and they felt the night air. Then there was more stone, and steps down. “It’s my belief we really  are  going to the deepest dungeon below the castle moat this time,” said Cyril. And they were. At least it was not below a moat, but below the river Euphrates, which was just as bad if not worse. In a most unpleasant place it was. Dark, very, very damp, and with an odd, musty smell rather like the shells of oysters. There was a torch—that is to say, a copper basket on a high stick with oiled wood burning in it. By its light the children saw that the walls were green, and that trickles of water ran down them and dripped from the roof. There were things on the floor that looked like newts, and in the dark corners creepy, shiny things moved sluggishly, uneasily, horribly. Robert’s heart sank right into those really reliable boots of his. Anthea and Cyril each had a private struggle with that inside disagreeableness which is part of all of us, and which is sometimes called the Old Adam—and both were victors. Neither of them said to Robert (and both tried hard not even to think it), “This is  your  doing.” Anthea had the additional temptation to add, “I told you so.” And she resisted it successfully. “Sacrilege, and impious cheek,” said the captain of the guard to the gaoler. “To be kept during the King’s pleasure. I expect he means to get some pleasure out of them tomorrow! He’ll tickle them up!” “Poor little kids,” said the gaoler. “Oh, yes,” said the captain. “I’ve got kids of my own too. But it doesn’t do to let domestic sentiment interfere with one’s public duties. Good night.” The soldiers tramped heavily off in their white and red and steel and gold. The gaoler, with a bunch of big keys in his hand, stood looking pityingly at the children. He shook his head twice and went out. “Courage!” said Anthea. “I know it will be all right. It’s only a dream  really , you know. It  must  be! I don’t believe about time being only a something or other of thought. It  is  a dream, and we’re bound to wake up all right and safe.” “Humph,” said Cyril bitterly. And Robert suddenly said— “It’s all my doing. If it really is all up do please not keep a down on me about it, and tell Father—Oh, I forgot.” What he had forgotten was that his father was 3,000 miles and 5,000 or more years away from him. “All right, Bobs, old man,” said Cyril; and Anthea got hold of Robert’s hand and squeezed it. Then the gaoler came back with a platter of hard, flat cakes made of coarse grain, very different from the cream-and-juicy-date feasts of the palace; also a pitcher of water. “There,” he said. “Oh, thank you so very much. You  are  kind,” said Anthea feverishly. “Go to sleep,” said the gaoler, pointing to a heap of straw in a corner; “tomorrow comes soon enough.” “Oh, dear Mr Gaoler,” said Anthea, “whatever will they do to us tomorrow?” “They’ll try to make you tell things,” said the gaoler grimly, “and my advice is if you’ve nothing to tell, make up something. Then perhaps they’ll sell you to the Northern nations. Regular savages  they  are. Good night.” “Good night,” said three trembling voices, which their owners strove in vain to render firm. Then he went out, and the three were left alone in the damp, dim vault. “I know the light won’t last long,” said Cyril, looking at the flickering brazier. “Is it any good, do you think, calling on the name when we haven’t got the charm?” suggested Anthea. “I shouldn’t think so. But we might try.” So they tried. But the blank silence of the damp dungeon remained unchanged. “What was the name the Queen said?” asked Cyril suddenly. “Nisbeth—Nesbit—something? You know, the slave of the great names?” “Wait a sec,” said Robert, “though I don’t know why you want it. Nusroch—Nisrock—Nisroch—that’s it.” Then Anthea pulled herself together. All her muscles tightened, and the muscles of her mind and soul, if you can call them that, tightened too. “UR HEKAU SETCHEH,” she cried in a fervent voice. “Oh, Nisroch, servant of the Great Ones, come and help us!” There was a waiting silence. Then a cold, blue light awoke in the corner where the straw was—and in the light they saw coming towards them a strange and terrible figure. I won’t try to describe it, because the drawing shows it, exactly as it was, and exactly as the old Babylonians carved it on their stones, so that you can see it in our own British Museum at this day. I will just say that it had eagle’s wings and an eagle’s head and the body of a man. It came towards them, strong and unspeakably horrible. “Oh, go away,” cried Anthea; but Cyril cried, “No; stay!” The creature hesitated, then bowed low before them on the damp floor of the dungeon. “Speak,” it said, in a harsh, grating voice like large rusty keys being turned in locks. “The servant of the Great Ones is  your  servant. What is your need that you call on the name of Nisroch?” “We want to go home,” said Robert. “No, no,” cried Anthea; “we want to be where Jane is.” Nisroch raised his great arm and pointed at the wall of the dungeon. And, as he pointed, the wall disappeared, and instead of the damp, green, rocky surface, there shone and glowed a room with rich hangings of red silk embroidered with golden water-lilies, with cushioned couches and great mirrors of polished steel; and in it was the Queen, and before her, on a red pillow, sat the Psammead, its fur hunched up in an irritated, discontented way. On a blue-covered couch lay Jane fast asleep. “Walk forward without fear,” said Nisroch. “Is there aught else that the Servant of the great Name can do for those who speak that name?” “No—oh,  no ,” said Cyril. “It’s all right now. Thanks ever so.” “You are a dear,” cried Anthea, not in the least knowing what she was saying. “Oh, thank you thank you. But  do  go  now! ” She caught the hand of the creature, and it was cold and hard in hers, like a hand of stone. “Go forward,” said Nisroch. And they went. “Oh, my good gracious,” said the Queen as they stood before her. “How did you get here? I  knew  you were magic. I meant to let you out the first thing in the morning, if I could slip away—but thanks be to Dagon, you’ve managed it for yourselves. You must get away. I’ll wake my chief lady and she shall call Ritti-Marduk, and he’ll let you out the back way, and—” “Don’t rouse anybody for goodness’ sake,” said Anthea, “except Jane, and I’ll rouse her.” She shook Jane with energy, and Jane slowly awoke. “Ritti-Marduk brought them in hours ago, really,” said the Queen, “but I wanted to have the Psammead all to myself for a bit. You’ll excuse the little natural deception?—it’s part of the Babylonish character, don’t you know? But I don’t want anything to happen to you. Do let me rouse someone.” “No, no, no,” said Anthea with desperate earnestness. She thought she knew enough of what the Babylonians were like when they were roused. “We can go by our own magic. And you will tell the King it wasn’t the gaoler’s fault. It was Nisroch.” “Nisroch!” echoed the Queen. “You are indeed magicians.” Jane sat up, blinking stupidly. “Hold  It  up, and say the word,” cried Cyril, catching up the Psammead, which mechanically bit him, but only very slightly. “Which is the East?” asked Jane. “Behind me,” said the Queen. “Why?” “Ur Hekau Setcheh,” said Jane sleepily, and held up the charm. And there they all were in the dining-room at 300, Fitzroy Street. “Jane,” cried Cyril with great presence of mind, “go and get the plate of sand down for the Psammead.” Jane went. “Look here!” he said quickly, as the sound of her boots grew less loud on the stairs, “don’t let’s tell her about the dungeon and all that. It’ll only frighten her so that she’ll never want to go anywhere else.” “Righto!” said Cyril; but Anthea felt that she could not have said a word to save her life. “Why did you want to come back in such a hurry?” asked Jane, returning with the plate of sand. “It was awfully jolly in Babylon, I think! I liked it no end.” “Oh, yes,” said Cyril carelessly. “It was jolly enough, of course, but I thought we’d been there long enough. Mother always says you oughtn’t to wear out your welcome!” CHAPTER VIII. THE QUEEN IN LONDON “Now tell us what happened to you,” said Cyril to Jane, when he and the others had told her all about the Queen’s talk and the banquet, and the variety entertainment, carefully stopping short before the beginning of the dungeon part of the story. “It wasn’t much good going,” said Jane, “if you didn’t even try to get the Amulet.” “We found out it was no go,” said Cyril; “it’s not to be got in Babylon. It was lost before that. We’ll go to some other jolly friendly place, where everyone is kind and pleasant, and look for it there. Now tell us about your part.” “Oh,” said Jane, “the Queen’s man with the smooth face—what was his name?” “Ritti-Marduk,” said Cyril. “Yes,” said Jane, “Ritti-Marduk, he came for me just after the Psammead had bitten the guard-of-the-gate’s wife’s little boy, and he took me to the Palace. And we had supper with the new little Queen from Egypt. She is a dear—not much older than you. She told me heaps about Egypt. And we played ball after supper. And then the Babylon Queen sent for me. I like her too. And she talked to the Psammead and I went to sleep. And then you woke me up. That’s all.” The Psammead, roused from its sound sleep, told the same story. “But,” it added, “what possessed you to tell that Queen that I could give wishes? I sometimes think you were born without even the most rudimentary imitation of brains.” The children did not know the meaning of rudimentary, but it sounded a rude, insulting word. “I don’t see that we did any harm,” said Cyril sulkily. “Oh, no,” said the Psammead with withering irony, “not at all! Of course not! Quite the contrary! Exactly so! Only she happened to wish that she might soon find herself in your country. And soon may mean any moment.” “Then it’s your fault,” said Robert, “because you might just as well have made ‘soon’ mean some moment next year or next century.” “That’s where you, as so often happens, make the mistake,” rejoined the Sand-fairy. “ I  couldn’t mean anything but what  she  meant by ‘soon’. It wasn’t my wish. And what she meant was the next time the King happens to go out lion hunting. So she’ll have a whole day, and perhaps two, to do as she wishes with. She doesn’t know about time only being a mode of thought.” “Well,” said Cyril, with a sigh of resignation, “we must do what we can to give her a good time. She was jolly decent to us. I say, suppose we were to go to St James’s Park after dinner and feed those ducks that we never did feed. After all that Babylon and all those years ago, I feel as if I should like to see something  real , and  now . You’ll come, Psammead?” “Where’s my priceless woven basket of sacred rushes?” asked the Psammead morosely. “I can’t go out with nothing on. And I won’t, what’s more.” And then everybody remembered with pain that the bass bag had, in the hurry of departure from Babylon, not been remembered. “But it’s not so extra precious,” said Robert hastily. “You can get them given to you for nothing if you buy fish in Farringdon Market.” “Oh,” said the Psammead very crossly indeed, “so you presume on my sublime indifference to the things of this disgusting modern world, to fob me off with a travelling equipage that costs you nothing. Very well, I shall go to sand. Please don’t wake me.” And it went then and there to sand, which, as you know, meant to bed. The boys went to St James’s Park to feed the ducks, but they went alone. Anthea and Jane sat sewing all the afternoon. They cut off half a yard from each of their best green Liberty sashes. A towel cut in two formed a lining; and they sat and sewed and sewed and sewed. What they were making was a bag for the Psammead. Each worked at a half of the bag. Jane’s half had four-leaved shamrocks embroidered on it. They were the only things she could do (because she had been taught how at school, and, fortunately, some of the silk she had been taught with was left over). And even so, Anthea had to draw the pattern for her. Anthea’s side of the bag had letters on it—worked hastily but affectionately in chain stitch. They were something like this:   She would have put “travelling carriage”, but she made the letters too big, so there was no room. The bag was made  into  a bag with old Nurse’s sewing machine, and the strings of it were Anthea’s and Jane’s best red hair ribbons. At tea-time, when the boys had come home with a most unfavourable report of the St James’s Park ducks, Anthea ventured to awaken the Psammead, and to show it its new travelling bag. “Humph,” it said, sniffing a little contemptuously, yet at the same time affectionately, “it’s not so dusty.” The Psammead seemed to pick up very easily the kind of things that people said nowadays. For a creature that had in its time associated with Megatheriums and Pterodactyls, its quickness was really wonderful. “It’s more worthy of me,” it said, “than the kind of bag that’s given away with a pound of plaice. When do you propose to take me out in it?” “I should like a rest from taking you or us anywhere,” said Cyril. But Jane said— “I want to go to Egypt. I did like that Egyptian Princess that came to marry the King in Babylon. She told me about the larks they have in Egypt. And the cats. Do let’s go there. And I told her what the bird things on the Amulet were like. And she said it was Egyptian writing.” The others exchanged looks of silent rejoicing at the thought of their cleverness in having concealed from Jane the terrors they had suffered in the dungeon below the Euphrates. “Egypt’s so nice too,” Jane went on, “because of Doctor Brewer’s Scripture History. I would like to go there when Joseph was dreaming those curious dreams, or when Moses was doing wonderful things with snakes and sticks.” “I don’t care about snakes,” said Anthea shuddering. “Well, we needn’t be in at that part, but Babylon was lovely! We had cream and sweet, sticky stuff. And I expect Egypt’s the same.” There was a good deal of discussion, but it all ended in everybody’s agreeing to Jane’s idea. And next morning directly after breakfast (which was kippers and very nice) the Psammead was invited to get into his travelling carriage. The moment after it had done so, with stiff, furry reluctance, like that of a cat when you want to nurse it, and its ideas are not the same as yours, old Nurse came in. “Well, chickies,” she said, “are you feeling very dull?” “Oh, no, Nurse dear,” said Anthea; “we’re having a lovely time. We’re just going off to see some old ancient relics.” “Ah,” said old Nurse, “the Royal Academy, I suppose? Don’t go wasting your money too reckless, that’s all.” She cleared away the kipper bones and the tea-things, and when she had swept up the crumbs and removed the cloth, the Amulet was held up and the order given—just as Duchesses (and other people) give it to their coachmen. “To Egypt, please!” said Anthea, when Cyril had uttered the wonderful Name of Power. “When Moses was there,” added Jane. And there, in the dingy Fitzroy Street dining-room, the Amulet grew big, and it was an arch, and through it they saw a blue, blue sky and a running river. “No, stop!” said Cyril, and pulled down Jane’s hand with the Amulet in it. “What silly cuckoos we all are,” he said. “Of course we can’t go. We daren’t leave home for a single minute now, for fear that minute should be  the  minute.” “What minute be  what  minute?” asked Jane impatiently, trying to get her hand away from Cyril. “The minute when the Queen of Babylon comes,” said Cyril. And then everyone saw it. For some days life flowed in a very slow, dusty, uneventful stream. The children could never go out all at once, because they never knew when the King of Babylon would go out lion hunting and leave his Queen free to pay them that surprise visit to which she was, without doubt, eagerly looking forward. So they took it in turns, two and two, to go out and to stay in. The stay-at-homes would have been much duller than they were but for the new interest taken in them by the learned gentleman. He called Anthea in one day to show her a beautiful necklace of purple and gold beads. “I saw one like that,” she said, “in—” “In the British Museum, perhaps?” “I like to call the place where I saw it Babylon,” said Anthea cautiously. “A pretty fancy,” said the learned gentleman, “and quite correct too, because, as a matter of fact, these beads did come from Babylon.” The other three were all out that day. The boys had been going to the Zoo, and Jane had said so plaintively, “I’m sure I am fonder of rhinoceroses than either of you are,” that Anthea had told her to run along then. And she had run, catching the boys before that part of the road where Fitzroy Street suddenly becomes Fitzroy Square. “I think Babylon is most frightfully interesting,” said Anthea. “I do have such interesting dreams about it—at least, not dreams exactly, but quite as wonderful.” “Do sit down and tell me,” said he. So she sat down and told. And he asked her a lot of questions, and she answered them as well as she could. “Wonderful—wonderful!” he said at last. “One’s heard of thought-transference, but I never thought  I  had any power of that sort. Yet it must be that, and very bad for  you , I should think. Doesn’t your head ache very much?” He suddenly put a cold, thin hand on her forehead. “No thank you, not at all,” said she. “I assure you it is not done intentionally,” he went on. “Of course I know a good deal about Babylon, and I unconsciously communicate it to you; you’ve heard of thought-reading, but some of the things you say, I don’t understand; they never enter my head, and yet they’re so astoundingly probable.” “It’s all right,” said Anthea reassuringly. “ I  understand. And don’t worry. It’s all quite simple really.” It was not quite so simple when Anthea, having heard the others come in, went down, and before she had had time to ask how they had liked the Zoo, heard a noise outside, compared to which the wild beasts’ noises were gentle as singing birds. “Good gracious!” cried Anthea, “what’s that?” The loud hum of many voices came through the open window. Words could be distinguished. “’Ere’s a guy!” “This ain’t November. That ain’t no guy. It’s a ballet lady, that’s what it is.” “Not it—it’s a bloomin’ looney, I tell you.” Then came a clear voice that they knew. “Retire, slaves!” it said. “What’s she a saying of?” cried a dozen voices. “Some blamed foreign lingo,” one voice replied. The children rushed to the door. A crowd was on the road and pavement. In the middle of the crowd, plainly to be seen from the top of the steps, were the beautiful face and bright veil of the Babylonian Queen. “Jimminy!” cried Robert, and ran down the steps, “here she is!” “Here!” he cried, “look out—let the lady pass. She’s a friend of ours, coming to see us.” “Nice friend for a respectable house,” snorted a fat woman with marrows on a handcart. All the same the crowd made way a little. The Queen met Robert on the pavement, and Cyril joined them, the Psammead bag still on his arm. “Here,” he whispered; “here’s the Psammead; you can get wishes.” “ I  wish you’d come in a different dress, if you  had  to come,” said Robert; “but it’s no use my wishing anything.” “No,” said the Queen. “I wish I was dressed—no, I don’t—I wish  they  were dressed properly, then they wouldn’t be so silly.” The Psammead blew itself out till the bag was a very tight fit for it; and suddenly every man, woman, and child in that crowd felt that it had not enough clothes on. For, of course, the Queen’s idea of proper dress was the dress that had been proper for the working-classes 3,000 years ago in Babylon—and there was not much of it. “Lawky me!” said the marrow-selling woman, “whatever could a-took me to come out this figure?” and she wheeled her cart away very quickly indeed. “Someone’s made a pretty guy of you—talk of guys,” said a man who sold bootlaces. “Well, don’t you talk,” said the man next to him. “Look at your own silly legs; and where’s your boots?” “I never come out like this, I’ll take my sacred,” said the bootlace-seller. “I wasn’t quite myself last night, I’ll own, but not to dress up like a circus.” The crowd was all talking at once, and getting rather angry. But no one seemed to think of blaming the Queen. Anthea bounded down the steps and pulled her up; the others followed, and the door was shut. “Blowed if I can make it out!” they heard. “I’m off home, I am.” And the crowd, coming slowly to the same mind, dispersed, followed by another crowd of persons who were not dressed in what the Queen thought was the proper way. “We shall have the police here directly,” said Anthea in the tones of despair. “Oh, why did you come dressed like that?” The Queen leaned against the arm of the horse-hair sofa. “How else can a queen dress I should like to know?” she questioned. “Our Queen wears things like other people,” said Cyril. “Well, I don’t. And I must say,” she remarked in an injured tone, “that you don’t seem very glad to see me now I  have  come. But perhaps it’s the surprise that makes you behave like this. Yet you ought to be used to surprises. The way you vanished! I shall never forget it. The best magic I’ve ever seen. How did you do it?” “Oh, never mind about that now,” said Robert. “You see you’ve gone and upset all those people, and I expect they’ll fetch the police. And we don’t want to see you collared and put in prison.” “You can’t put queens in prison,” she said loftily. “Oh, can’t you?” said Cyril. “We cut off a king’s head here once.” “In this miserable room? How frightfully interesting.” “No, no, not in this room; in history.” “Oh, in  that ,” said the Queen disparagingly. “I thought you’d done it with your own hands.” The girls shuddered. “What a hideous city yours is,” the Queen went on pleasantly, “and what horrid, ignorant people. Do you know they actually can’t understand a single word I say.” “Can you understand them?” asked Jane. “Of course not; they speak some vulgar, Northern dialect. I can understand  you  quite well.” I really am not going to explain  again  how it was that the children could understand other languages than their own so thoroughly, and talk them, too, so that it felt and sounded (to them) just as though they were talking English. “Well,” said Cyril bluntly, “now you’ve seen just how horrid it is, don’t you think you might as well go home again?” “Why, I’ve seen simply nothing yet,” said the Queen, arranging her starry veil. “I wished to be at your door, and I was. Now I must go and see your King and Queen.” “Nobody’s allowed to,” said Anthea in haste; “but look here, we’ll take you and show you anything you’d like to see—anything you  can  see,” she added kindly, because she remembered how nice the Queen had been to them in Babylon, even if she had been a little deceitful in the matter of Jane and Psammead. “There’s the Museum,” said Cyril hopefully; “there are lots of things from your country there. If only we could disguise you a little.” “I know,” said Anthea suddenly. “Mother’s old theatre cloak, and there are a lot of her old hats in the big box.” The blue silk, lace-trimmed cloak did indeed hide some of the Queen’s startling splendours, but the hat fitted very badly. It had pink roses in it; and there was something about the coat or the hat or the Queen, that made her look somehow not very respectable. “Oh, never mind,” said Anthea, when Cyril whispered this. “The thing is to get her out before Nurse has finished her forty winks. I should think she’s about got to the thirty-ninth wink by now.” “Come on then,” said Robert. “You know how dangerous it is. Let’s make haste into the Museum. If any of those people you made guys of do fetch the police, they won’t think of looking for you there.” The blue silk coat and the pink-rosed hat attracted almost as much attention as the royal costume had done; and the children were uncommonly glad to get out of the noisy streets into the grey quiet of the Museum. “Parcels and umbrellas to be left here,” said a man at the counter. The party had no umbrellas, and the only parcel was the bag containing the Psammead, which the Queen had insisted should be brought. “ I’m  not going to be left,” said the Psammead softly, “so don’t you think it.” “I’ll wait outside with you,” said Anthea hastily, and went to sit on the seat near the drinking fountain. “Don’t sit so near that nasty fountain,” said the creature crossly; “I might get splashed.” Anthea obediently moved to another seat and waited. Indeed she waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited. The Psammead dropped into an uneasy slumber. Anthea had long ceased to watch the swing-door that always let out the wrong person, and she was herself almost asleep, and still the others did not come back. It was quite a start when Anthea suddenly realized that they  had  come back, and that they were not alone. Behind them was quite a crowd of men in uniform, and several gentlemen were there. Everyone seemed very angry. “Now go,” said the nicest of the angry gentlemen. “Take the poor, demented thing home and tell your parents she ought to be properly looked after.” “If you can’t get her to go we must send for the police,” said the nastiest gentleman. “But we don’t wish to use harsh measures,” added the nice one, who was really very nice indeed, and seemed to be over all the others. “May I speak to my sister a moment first?” asked Robert. The nicest gentleman nodded, and the officials stood round the Queen, the others forming a sort of guard while Robert crossed over to Anthea. “Everything you can think of,” he replied to Anthea’s glance of inquiry. “Kicked up the most frightful shine in there. Said those necklaces and earrings and things in the glass cases were all hers—would have them out of the cases. Tried to break the glass—she did break one bit! Everybody in the place has been at her. No good. I only got her out by telling her that was the place where they cut queens’ heads off.” “Oh, Bobs, what a whacker!” “You’d have told a whackinger one to get her out. Besides, it wasn’t. I meant  mummy  queens. How do you know they don’t cut off mummies’ heads to see how the embalming is done? What I want to say is, can’t you get her to go with you quietly?” “I’ll try,” said Anthea, and went up to the Queen. “Do come home,” she said; “the learned gentleman in our house has a much nicer necklace than anything they’ve got here. Come and see it.” The Queen nodded. “You see,” said the nastiest gentleman, “she does understand English.” “I was talking Babylonian, I think,” said Anthea bashfully. “My good child,” said the nice gentleman, “what you’re talking is not Babylonian, but nonsense. You just go home  at once , and tell your parents exactly what has happened.” Anthea took the Queen’s hand and gently pulled her away. The other children followed, and the black crowd of angry gentlemen stood on the steps watching them. It was when the little party of disgraced children, with the Queen who had disgraced them, had reached the middle of the courtyard that her eyes fell on the bag where the Psammead was. She stopped short. “I wish,” she said, very loud and clear, “that all those Babylonian things would come out to me here—slowly, so that those dogs and slaves can see the working of the great Queen’s magic.” “Oh, you  are  a tiresome woman,” said the Psammead in its bag, but it puffed itself out. Next moment there was a crash. The glass swing doors and all their framework were smashed suddenly and completely. The crowd of angry gentlemen sprang aside when they saw what had done this. But the nastiest of them was not quick enough, and he was roughly pushed out of the way by an enormous stone bull that was floating steadily through the door. It came and stood beside the Queen in the middle of the courtyard. It was followed by more stone images, by great slabs of carved stone, bricks, helmets, tools, weapons, fetters, wine-jars, bowls, bottles, vases, jugs, saucers, seals, and the round long things, something like rolling pins with marks on them like the print of little bird-feet, necklaces, collars, rings, armlets, earrings—heaps and heaps and heaps of things, far more than anyone had time to count, or even to see distinctly. All the angry gentlemen had abruptly sat down on the Museum steps except the nice one. He stood with his hands in his pockets just as though he was quite used to seeing great stone bulls and all sorts of small Babylonish objects float out into the Museum yard. But he sent a man to close the big iron gates. A journalist, who was just leaving the museum, spoke to Robert as he passed. “Theosophy, I suppose?” he said. “Is she Mrs Besant?” “ Yes ,” said Robert recklessly. The journalist passed through the gates just before they were shut. He rushed off to Fleet Street, and his paper got out a new edition within half an hour. MRS BESANT AND THEOSOPHY IMPERTINENT MIRACLE AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM. People saw it in fat, black letters on the boards carried by the sellers of newspapers. Some few people who had nothing better to do went down to the Museum on the tops of omnibuses. But by the time they got there there was nothing to be seen. For the Babylonian Queen had suddenly seen the closed gates, had felt the threat of them, and had said— “I wish we were in your house.” And, of course, instantly they were. The Psammead was furious. “Look here,” it said, “they’ll come after you, and they’ll find  me . There’ll be a National Cage built for me at Westminster, and I shall have to work at politics. Why wouldn’t you leave the things in their places?” “What a temper you have, haven’t you?” said the Queen serenely. “I wish all the things were back in their places. Will  that  do for you?” The Psammead swelled and shrank and spoke very angrily. “I can’t refuse to give your wishes,” it said, “but I can Bite. And I will if this goes on. Now then.” “Ah, don’t,” whispered Anthea close to its bristling ear; “it’s dreadful for us too. Don’t  you  desert us. Perhaps she’ll wish herself at home again soon.” “Not she,” said the Psammead a little less crossly. “Take me to see your City,” said the Queen. The children looked at each other. “If we had some money we could take her about in a cab. People wouldn’t notice her so much then. But we haven’t.” “Sell this,” said the Queen, taking a ring from her finger. “They’d only think we’d stolen it,” said Cyril bitterly, “and put us in prison.” “All roads lead to prison with you, it seems,” said the Queen. “The learned gentleman!” said Anthea, and ran up to him with the ring in her hand. “Look here,” she said, “will you buy this for a pound?” “Oh!” he said in tones of joy and amazement, and took the ring into his hand. “It’s my very own,” said Anthea; “it was given to me to sell.” “I’ll lend you a pound,” said the learned gentleman, “with pleasure; and I’ll take care of the ring for you. Who did you say gave it to you?” “We call her,” said Anthea carefully, “the Queen of Babylon.” “Is it a game?” he asked hopefully. “It’ll be a pretty game if I don’t get the money to pay for cabs for her,” said Anthea. “I sometimes think,” he said slowly, “that I am becoming insane, or that—” “Or that I am; but I’m not, and you’re not, and she’s not.” “Does she  say  that she’s the Queen of Babylon?” he uneasily asked. “Yes,” said Anthea recklessly. “This thought-transference is more far-reaching than I imagined,” he said. “I suppose I have unconsciously influenced  her , too. I never thought my Babylonish studies would bear fruit like this. Horrible! There are more things in heaven and earth—” “Yes,” said Anthea, “heaps more. And the pound is the thing  I  want more than anything on earth.” He ran his fingers through his thin hair. “This thought-transference!” he said. “It’s undoubtedly a Babylonian ring—or it seems so to me. But perhaps I have hypnotized myself. I will see a doctor the moment I have corrected the last proofs of my book.” “Yes, do!” said Anthea, “and thank you so very much.” She took the sovereign and ran down to the others. And now from the window of a four-wheeled cab the Queen of Babylon beheld the wonders of London. Buckingham Palace she thought uninteresting; Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament little better. But she liked the Tower, and the River, and the ships filled her with wonder and delight. “But how badly you keep your slaves. How wretched and poor and neglected they seem,” she said, as the cab rattled along the Mile End Road. “They aren’t slaves; they’re working-people,” said Jane. “Of course they’re working. That’s what slaves are. Don’t you tell me. Do you suppose I don’t know a slave’s face when I see it? Why don’t their masters see that they’re better fed and better clothed? Tell me in three words.” No one answered. The wage-system of modern England is a little difficult to explain in three words even if you understand it—which the children didn’t. “You’ll have a revolt of your slaves if you’re not careful,” said the Queen. “Oh, no,” said Cyril; “you see they have votes—that makes them safe not to revolt. It makes all the difference. Father told me so.” “What is this vote?” asked the Queen. “Is it a charm? What do they do with it?” “I don’t know,” said the harassed Cyril; “it’s just a vote, that’s all! They don’t do anything particular with it.” “I see,” said the Queen; “a sort of plaything. Well, I wish that all these slaves may have in their hands this moment their fill of their favourite meat and drink.” Instantly all the people in the Mile End Road, and in all the other streets where poor people live, found their hands full of things to eat and drink. From the cab window could be seen persons carrying every kind of food, and bottles and cans as well. Roast meat, fowls, red lobsters, great yellowy crabs, fried fish, boiled pork, beef-steak puddings, baked onions, mutton pies; most of the young people had oranges and sweets and cake. It made an enormous change in the look of the Mile End Road—brightened it up, so to speak, and brightened up, more than you can possibly imagine, the faces of the people. “Makes a difference, doesn’t it?” said the Queen. “That’s the best wish you’ve had yet,” said Jane with cordial approval. Just by the Bank the cabman stopped. “I ain’t agoin’ to drive you no further,” he said. “Out you gets.” They got out rather unwillingly. “I wants my tea,” he said; and they saw that on the box of the cab was a mound of cabbage, with pork chops and apple sauce, a duck, and a spotted currant pudding. Also a large can. “You pay me my fare,” he said threateningly, and looked down at the mound, muttering again about his tea. “We’ll take another cab,” said Cyril with dignity. “Give me change for a sovereign, if you please.” But the cabman, as it turned out, was not at all a nice character. He took the sovereign, whipped up his horse, and disappeared in the stream of cabs and omnibuses and wagons, without giving them any change at all. Already a little crowd was collecting round the party. “Come on,” said Robert, leading the wrong way. The crowd round them thickened. They were in a narrow street where many gentlemen in black coats and without hats were standing about on the pavement talking very loudly. “How ugly their clothes are,” said the Queen of Babylon. “They’d be rather fine men, some of them, if they were dressed decently, especially the ones with the beautiful long, curved noses. I wish they were dressed like the Babylonians of my court.” And of course, it was so. The moment the almost fainting Psammead had blown itself out every man in Throgmorton Street appeared abruptly in Babylonian full dress. All were carefully powdered, their hair and beards were scented and curled, their garments richly embroidered. They wore rings and armlets, flat gold collars and swords, and impossible-looking head-dresses. A stupefied silence fell on them. “I say,” a youth who had always been fair-haired broke that silence, “it’s only fancy of course—something wrong with my eyes—but you chaps do look so rum.” “Rum,” said his friend. “Look at  you . You in a sash! My hat! And your hair’s gone black and you’ve got a beard. It’s my belief we’ve been poisoned. You do look a jackape.” “Old Levinstein don’t look so bad. But how was it  done —that’s what I want to know. How  was  it done? Is it conjuring, or what?” “I think it is chust a ver’ bad tream,” said old Levinstein to his clerk; “all along Bishopsgate I haf seen the gommon people have their hants full of food— goot  food. Oh yes, without doubt a very bad tream!” “Then I’m dreaming too, sir,” said the clerk, looking down at his legs with an expression of loathing. “I see my feet in beastly sandals as plain as plain.” “All that goot food wasted,” said old Mr Levinstein. A bad tream—a bad tream.” The Members of the Stock Exchange are said to be at all times a noisy lot. But the noise they made now to express their disgust at the costumes of ancient Babylon was far louder than their ordinary row. One had to shout before one could hear oneself speak. “I only wish,” said the clerk who thought it was conjuring—he was quite close to the children and they trembled, because they knew that whatever he wished would come true. “I only wish we knew who’d done it.” And, of course, instantly they did know, and they pressed round the Queen. “Scandalous! Shameful! Ought to be put down by law. Give her in charge. Fetch the police,” two or three voices shouted at once. The Queen recoiled. “What is it?” she asked. “They sound like caged lions—lions by the thousand. What is it that they say?” “They say ‘Police!’,” said Cyril briefly. “I knew they would sooner or later. And I don’t blame them, mind you.” “I wish my guards were here!” cried the Queen. The exhausted Psammead was panting and trembling, but the Queen’s guards in red and green garments, and brass and iron gear, choked Throgmorton Street, and bared weapons flashed round the Queen. “I’m mad,” said a Mr Rosenbaum; “dat’s what it is—mad!” “It’s a judgement on you, Rosy,” said his partner. “I always said you were too hard in that matter of Flowerdew. It’s a judgement, and I’m in it too.” The members of the Stock Exchange had edged carefully away from the gleaming blades, the mailed figures, the hard, cruel Eastern faces. But Throgmorton Street is narrow, and the crowd was too thick for them to get away as quickly as they wished. “Kill them,” cried the Queen. “Kill the dogs!” The guards obeyed. “It  is  all a dream,” cried Mr Levinstein, cowering in a doorway behind his clerk. “It isn’t,” said the clerk. “It isn’t. Oh, my good gracious! those foreign brutes are killing everybody. Henry Hirsh is down now, and Prentice is cut in two—oh, Lord! and Huth, and there goes Lionel Cohen with his head off, and Guy Nickalls has lost his head now. A dream? I wish to goodness it was all a dream.” And, of course, instantly it was! The entire Stock Exchange rubbed its eyes and went back to close, to over, and either side of seven-eights, and Trunks, and Kaffirs, and Steel Common, and Contangoes, and Backwardations, Double Options, and all the interesting subjects concerning which they talk in the Street without ceasing. No one said a word about it to anyone else. I think I have explained before that business men do not like it to be known that they have been dreaming in business hours. Especially mad dreams including such dreadful things as hungry people getting dinners, and the destruction of the Stock Exchange. The children were in the dining-room at 300, Fitzroy Street, pale and trembling. The Psammead crawled out of the embroidered bag, and lay flat on the table, its leg stretched out, looking more like a dead hare than anything else. “Thank Goodness that’s over,” said Anthea, drawing a deep breath. “She won’t come back, will she?” asked Jane tremulously. “No,” said Cyril. “She’s thousands of years ago. But we spent a whole precious pound on her. It’ll take all our pocket-money for ages to pay that back.” “Not if it was  all  a dream,” said Robert. “The wish said  all  a dream, you know, Panther; you cut up and ask if he lent you anything.” “I beg your pardon,” said Anthea politely, following the sound of her knock into the presence of the learned gentleman, “I’m  so  sorry to trouble you, but  did  you lend me a pound today?” “No,” said he, looking kindly at her through his spectacles. “But it’s extraordinary that you should ask me, for I dozed for a few moments this afternoon, a thing I very rarely do, and I dreamed quite distinctly that you brought me a ring that you said belonged to the Queen of Babylon, and that I lent you a sovereign and that you left one of the Queen’s rings here. The ring was a magnificent specimen.” He sighed. “I wish it hadn’t been a dream,” he said smiling. He was really learning to smile quite nicely. Anthea could not be too thankful that the Psammead was not there to grant his wish. CHAPTER IX. ATLANTIS You will understand that the adventure of the Babylonian queen in London was the only one that had occupied any time at all. But the children’s time was very fully taken up by talking over all the wonderful things seen and done in the Past, where, by the power of the Amulet, they seemed to spend hours and hours, only to find when they got back to London that the whole thing had been briefer than a lightning flash. They talked of the Past at their meals, in their walks, in the dining-room, in the first-floor drawing-room, but most of all on the stairs. It was an old house; it had once been a fashionable one, and was a fine one still. The banister rails of the stairs were excellent for sliding down, and in the corners of the landings were big alcoves that had once held graceful statues, and now quite often held the graceful forms of Cyril, Robert, Anthea, and Jane. One day Cyril and Robert in tight white underclothing had spent a pleasant hour in reproducing the attitudes of statues seen either in the British Museum, or in Father’s big photograph book. But the show ended abruptly because Robert wanted to be the Venus of Milo, and for this purpose pulled at the sheet which served for drapery at the very moment when Cyril, looking really quite like the Discobolos—with a gold and white saucer for the disc—was standing on one foot, and under that one foot was the sheet. Of course the Discobolos and his disc and the would-be Venus came down together, and everyone was a good deal hurt, especially the saucer, which would never be the same again, however neatly one might join its uneven bits with Seccotine or the white of an egg. “I hope you’re satisfied,” said Cyril, holding his head where a large lump was rising. “Quite, thanks,” said Robert bitterly. His thumb had caught in the banisters and bent itself back almost to breaking point. “I  am  so sorry, poor, dear Squirrel,” said Anthea; “and you were looking so lovely. I’ll get a wet rag. Bobs, go and hold your hand under the hot-water tap. It’s what ballet girls do with their legs when they hurt them. I saw it in a book.” “What book?” said Robert disagreeably. But he went. When he came back Cyril’s head had been bandaged by his sisters, and he had been brought to the state of mind where he was able reluctantly to admit that he supposed Robert hadn’t done it on purpose. Robert replying with equal suavity, Anthea hastened to lead the talk away from the accident. “I suppose you don’t feel like going anywhere through the Amulet,” she said. “Egypt!” said Jane promptly. “I want to see the pussy cats.” “Not me—too hot,” said Cyril. “It’s about as much as I can stand here—let alone Egypt.” It was indeed, hot, even on the second landing, which was the coolest place in the house. “Let’s go to the North Pole.” “I don’t suppose the Amulet was ever there—and we might get our fingers frost-bitten so that we could never hold it up to get home again. No thanks,” said Robert. “I say,” said Jane, “let’s get the Psammead and ask its advice. It will like us asking, even if we don’t take it.” The Psammead was brought up in its green silk embroidered bag, but before it could be asked anything the door of the learned gentleman’s room opened and the voice of the visitor who had been lunching with him was heard on the stairs. He seemed to be speaking with the door handle in his hand. “You see a doctor, old boy,” he said; “all that about thought-transference is just simply twaddle. You’ve been over-working. Take a holiday. Go to Dieppe.” “I’d rather go to Babylon,” said the learned gentleman. “I wish you’d go to Atlantis some time, while we’re about it, so as to give me some tips for my  Nineteenth Century  article when you come home.” “I wish I could,” said the voice of the learned gentleman. “Goodbye. Take care of yourself.” The door was banged, and the visitor came smiling down the stairs—a stout, prosperous, big man. The children had to get up to let him pass. “Hullo, Kiddies,” he said, glancing at the bandages on the head of Cyril and the hand of Robert, “been in the wars?” “It’s all right,” said Cyril. “I say, what was that Atlantic place you wanted him to go to? We couldn’t help hearing you talk.” “You talk so  very  loud, you see,” said Jane soothingly. “Atlantis,” said the visitor, “the lost Atlantis, garden of the Hesperides. Great continent—disappeared in the sea. You can read about it in Plato.” “Thank you,” said Cyril doubtfully. “Were there any Amulets there?” asked Anthea, made anxious by a sudden thought. “Hundreds, I should think. So  he’s  been talking to you?” “Yes, often. He’s very kind to us. We like him awfully.” “Well, what he wants is a holiday; you persuade him to take one. What he wants is a change of scene. You see, his head is crusted so thickly inside with knowledge about Egypt and Assyria and things that you can’t hammer anything into it unless you keep hard at it all day long for days and days. And I haven’t time. But you live in the house. You can hammer almost incessantly. Just try your hands, will you? Right. So long!” He went down the stairs three at a time, and Jane remarked that he was a nice man, and she thought he had little girls of his own. “I should like to have them to play with,” she added pensively. The three elder ones exchanged glances. Cyril nodded. “All right.  Let’s  go to Atlantis,” he said. “Let’s go to Atlantis and take the learned gentleman with us,” said Anthea; “he’ll think it’s a dream, afterwards, but it’ll certainly be a change of scene.” “Why not take him to nice Egypt?” asked Jane. “Too hot,” said Cyril shortly. “Or Babylon, where he wants to go?” “I’ve had enough of Babylon,” said Robert, “at least for the present. And so have the others. I don’t know why,” he added, forestalling the question on Jane’s lips, “but somehow we have. Squirrel, let’s take off these beastly bandages and get into flannels. We can’t go in our unders.” “He  wished  to go to Atlantis, so he’s got to go some time; and he might as well go with us,” said Anthea. This was how it was that the learned gentleman, permitting himself a few moments of relaxation in his chair, after the fatigue of listening to opinions (about Atlantis and many other things) with which he did not at all agree, opened his eyes to find his four young friends standing in front of him in a row. “Will you come,” said Anthea, “to Atlantis with us?” “To know that you are dreaming shows that the dream is nearly at an end,” he told himself; “or perhaps it’s only a game, like ‘How many miles to Babylon?’” So he said aloud: “Thank you very much, but I have only a quarter of an hour to spare.” “It doesn’t take any time,” said Cyril; “time is only a mode of thought, you know, and you’ve got to go some time, so why not with us?” “Very well,” said the learned gentleman, now quite certain that he was dreaming. Anthea held out her soft, pink hand. He took it. She pulled him gently to his feet. Jane held up the Amulet. “To just outside Atlantis,” said Cyril, and Jane said the Name of Power. “You owl!” said Robert, “it’s an island. Outside an island’s all water.” “I won’t go. I  won’t ,” said the Psammead, kicking and struggling in its bag. But already the Amulet had grown to a great arch. Cyril pushed the learned gentleman, as undoubtedly the first-born, through the arch—not into water, but on to a wooden floor, out of doors. The others followed. The Amulet grew smaller again, and there they all were, standing on the deck of a ship whose sailors were busy making her fast with chains to rings on a white quay-side. The rings and the chains were of a metal that shone red-yellow like gold. Everyone on the ship seemed too busy at first to notice the group of newcomers from Fitzroy Street. Those who seemed to be officers were shouting orders to the men. They stood and looked across the wide quay to the town that rose beyond it. What they saw was the most beautiful sight any of them had ever seen—or ever dreamed of. The blue sea sparkled in soft sunlight; little white-capped waves broke softly against the marble breakwaters that guarded the shipping of a great city from the wilderness of winter winds and seas. The quay was of marble, white and sparkling with a veining bright as gold. The city was of marble, red and white. The greater buildings that seemed to be temples and palaces were roofed with what looked like gold and silver, but most of the roofs were of copper that glowed golden-red on the houses on the hills among which the city stood, and shaded into marvellous tints of green and blue and purple where they had been touched by the salt sea spray and the fumes of the dyeing and smelting works of the lower town. Broad and magnificent flights of marble stairs led up from the quay to a sort of terrace that seemed to run along for miles, and beyond rose the town built on a hill. The learned gentleman drew a long breath. “Wonderful!” he said, “wonderful!” “I say, Mr—what’s your name,” said Robert. “He means,” said Anthea, with gentle politeness, “that we never can remember your name. I know it’s Mr De Something.” “When I was your age I was called Jimmy,” he said timidly. “Would you mind? I should feel more at home in a dream like this if I—Anything that made me seem more like one of you.” “Thank you—Jimmy,” said Anthea with an effort. It seemed such a cheek to be saying Jimmy to a grown-up man. “Jimmy,  dear ,” she added, with no effort at all. Jimmy smiled and looked pleased. But now the ship was made fast, and the Captain had time to notice other things. He came towards them, and he was dressed in the best of all possible dresses for the seafaring life. “What are you doing here?” he asked rather fiercely. “Do you come to bless or to curse?” “To bless, of course,” said Cyril. “I’m sorry if it annoys you, but we’re here by magic. We come from the land of the sun-rising,” he went on explanatorily. “I see,” said the Captain; no one had expected that he would. “I didn’t notice at first, but of course I hope you’re a good omen. It’s needed. And this,” he pointed to the learned gentleman, “your slave, I presume?” “Not at all,” said Anthea; “he’s a very great man. A sage, don’t they call it? And we want to see all your beautiful city, and your temples and things, and then we shall go back, and he will tell his friend, and his friend will write a book about it.” “What,” asked the Captain, fingering a rope, “is a book?” “A record—something written, or,” she added hastily, remembering the Babylonian writing, “or engraved.” Some sudden impulse of confidence made Jane pluck the Amulet from the neck of her frock. “Like this,” she said. The Captain looked at it curiously, but, the other three were relieved to notice, without any of that overwhelming interest which the mere name of it had roused in Egypt and Babylon. “The stone is of our country,” he said; “and that which is engraved on it, it is like our writing, but I cannot read it. What is the name of your sage?” “Ji-jimmy,” said Anthea hesitatingly. The Captain repeated, “Ji-jimmy. Will you land?” he added. “And shall I lead you to the Kings?” “Look here,” said Robert, “does your King hate strangers?” “Our Kings are ten,” said the Captain, “and the Royal line, unbroken from Poseidon, the father of us all, has the noble tradition to do honour to strangers if they come in peace.” “Then lead on, please,” said Robert, “though I  should  like to see all over your beautiful ship, and sail about in her.” “That shall be later,” said the Captain; “just now we’re afraid of a storm—do you notice that odd rumbling?” “That’s nothing, master,” said an old sailor who stood near; “it’s the pilchards coming in, that’s all.” “Too loud,” said the Captain. There was a rather anxious pause; then the Captain stepped on to the quay, and the others followed him. “Do talk to him—Jimmy,” said Anthea as they went; “you can find out all sorts of things for your friend’s book.” “Please excuse me,” he said earnestly. “If I talk I shall wake up; and besides, I can’t understand what he says.” No one else could think of anything to say, so that it was in complete silence that they followed the Captain up the marble steps and through the streets of the town. There were streets and shops and houses and markets. “It’s just like Babylon,” whispered Jane, “only everything’s perfectly different.” “It’s a great comfort the ten Kings have been properly brought up—to be kind to strangers,” Anthea whispered to Cyril. “Yes,” he said, “no deepest dungeons here.” There were no horses or chariots in the street, but there were handcarts and low trolleys running on thick log-wheels, and porters carrying packets on their heads, and a good many of the people were riding on what looked like elephants, only the great beasts were hairy, and they had not that mild expression we are accustomed to meet on the faces of the elephants at the Zoo. “Mammoths!” murmured the learned gentleman, and stumbled over a loose stone. The people in the streets kept crowding round them as they went along, but the Captain always dispersed the crowd before it grew uncomfortably thick by saying— “Children of the Sun God and their High Priest—come to bless the City.” And then the people would draw back with a low murmur that sounded like a suppressed cheer. Many of the buildings were covered with gold, but the gold on the bigger buildings was of a different colour, and they had sorts of steeples of burnished silver rising above them. “Are all these houses real gold?” asked Jane. “The temples are covered with gold, of course,” answered the Captain, “but the houses are only oricalchum. It’s not quite so expensive.” The learned gentleman, now very pale, stumbled along in a dazed way, repeating: “Oricalchum—oricalchum.” “Don’t be frightened,” said Anthea; “we can get home in a minute, just by holding up the charm. Would you rather go back now? We could easily come some other day without you.” “Oh, no, no,” he pleaded fervently; “let the dream go on. Please, please do.” “The High Ji-jimmy is perhaps weary with his magic journey,” said the Captain, noticing the blundering walk of the learned gentleman; “and we are yet very far from the Great Temple, where today the Kings make sacrifice.” He stopped at the gate of a great enclosure. It seemed to be a sort of park, for trees showed high above its brazen wall. The party waited, and almost at once the Captain came back with one of the hairy elephants and begged them to mount. This they did. It was a glorious ride. The elephant at the Zoo—to ride on him is also glorious, but he goes such a very little way, and then he goes back again, which is always dull. But this great hairy beast went on and on and on along streets and through squares and gardens. It was a glorious city; almost everything was built of marble, red, or white, or black. Every now and then the party crossed a bridge. It was not till they had climbed to the hill which is the centre of the town that they saw that the whole city was divided into twenty circles, alternately land and water, and over each of the water circles were the bridges by which they had come. And now they were in a great square. A vast building filled up one side of it; it was overlaid with gold, and had a dome of silver. The rest of the buildings round the square were of oricalchum. And it looked more splendid than you can possibly imagine, standing up bold and shining in the sunlight. “You would like a bath,” said the Captain, as the hairy elephant went clumsily down on his knees. “It’s customary, you know, before entering the Presence. We have baths for men, women, horses, and cattle. The High Class Baths are here. Our Father Poseidon gave us a spring of hot water and one of cold.” The children had never before bathed in baths of gold. “It feels very splendid,” said Cyril, splashing. “At least, of course, it’s not gold; it’s or—what’s its name,” said Robert. “Hand over that towel.” The bathing hall had several great pools sunk below the level of the floor; one went down to them by steps. “Jimmy,” said Anthea timidly, when, very clean and boiled-looking, they all met in the flowery courtyard of the Public, “don’t you think all this seems much more like  now  than Babylon or Egypt—? Oh, I forgot, you’ve never been there.” “I know a little of those nations, however,” said he, “and I quite agree with you. A most discerning remark—my dear,” he added awkwardly; “this city certainly seems to indicate a far higher level of civilization than the Egyptian or Babylonish, and—” “Follow me,” said the Captain. “Now, boys, get out of the way.” He pushed through a little crowd of boys who were playing with dried chestnuts fastened to a string. “Ginger!” remarked Robert, “they’re playing conkers, just like the kids in Kentish Town Road!” They could see now that three walls surrounded the island on which they were. The outermost wall was of brass, the Captain told them; the next, which looked like silver, was covered with tin; and the innermost one was of oricalchum. And right in the middle was a wall of gold, with golden towers and gates. “Behold the Temples of Poseidon,” said the Captain. “It is not lawful for me to enter. I will await your return here.” He told them what they ought to say, and the five people from Fitzroy Street took hands and went forward. The golden gates slowly opened. “We are the children of the Sun,” said Cyril, as he had been told, “and our High Priest, at least that’s what the Captain calls him. We have a different name for him at home.” “What is his name?” asked a white-robed man who stood in the doorway with his arms extended. “Ji-jimmy,” replied Cyril, and he hesitated as Anthea had done. It really did seem to be taking a great liberty with so learned a gentleman. “And we have come to speak with your Kings in the Temple of Poseidon—does that word sound right?” he whispered anxiously. “Quite,” said the learned gentleman. “It’s very odd I can understand what you say to them, but not what they say to you.” “The Queen of Babylon found that too,” said Cyril; “it’s part of the magic.” “Oh, what a dream!” said the learned gentleman. The white-robed priest had been joined by others, and all were bowing low. “Enter,” he said, “enter, Children of the Sun, with your High Ji-jimmy.” In an inner courtyard stood the Temple—all of silver, with gold pinnacles and doors, and twenty enormous statues in bright gold of men and women. Also an immense pillar of the other precious yellow metal. They went through the doors, and the priest led them up a stair into a gallery from which they could look down on to the glorious place. “The ten Kings are even now choosing the bull. It is not lawful for me to behold,” said the priest, and fell face downward on the floor outside the gallery. The children looked down. The roof was of ivory adorned with the three precious metals, and the walls were lined with the favourite oricalchum. At the far end of the Temple was a statue group, the like of which no one living has ever seen. It was of gold, and the head of the chief figure reached to the roof. That figure was Poseidon, the Father of the City. He stood in a great chariot drawn by six enormous horses, and round about it were a hundred mermaids riding on dolphins. Ten men, splendidly dressed and armed only with sticks and ropes, were trying to capture one of some fifteen bulls who ran this way and that about the floor of the Temple. The children held their breath, for the bulls looked dangerous, and the great horned heads were swinging more and more wildly. Anthea did not like looking at the bulls. She looked about the gallery, and noticed that another staircase led up from it to a still higher storey; also that a door led out into the open air, where there seemed to be a balcony. So that when a shout went up and Robert whispered, “Got him,” and she looked down and saw the herd of bulls being driven out of the Temple by whips, and the ten Kings following, one of them spurring with his stick a black bull that writhed and fought in the grip of a lasso, she answered the boy’s agitated, “Now we shan’t see anything more,” with— “Yes we can, there’s an outside balcony.” So they crowded out. But very soon the girls crept back. “I don’t like sacrifices,” Jane said. So she and Anthea went and talked to the priest, who was no longer lying on his face, but sitting on the top step mopping his forehead with his robe, for it was a hot day. “It’s a special sacrifice,” he said; “usually it’s only done on the justice days every five years and six years alternately. And then they drink the cup of wine with some of the bull’s blood in it, and swear to judge truly. And they wear the sacred blue robe, and put out all the Temple fires. But this today is because the City’s so upset by the odd noises from the sea, and the god inside the big mountain speaking with his thunder-voice. But all that’s happened so often before. If anything could make ME uneasy it wouldn’t be  that .” “What would it be?” asked Jane kindly. “It would be the Lemmings.” “Who are they—enemies?” “They’re a sort of rat; and every year they come swimming over from the country that no man knows, and stay here awhile, and then swim away. This year they haven’t come. You know rats won’t stay on a ship that’s going to be wrecked. If anything horrible were going to happen to us, it’s my belief those Lemmings would know; and that may be why they’ve fought shy of us.” “What do you call this country?” asked the Psammead, suddenly putting its head out of its bag. “Atlantis,” said the priest. “Then I advise you to get on to the highest ground you can find. I remember hearing something about a flood here. Look here, you”—it turned to Anthea; “let’s get home. The prospect’s too wet for my whiskers.” The girls obediently went to find their brothers, who were leaning on the balcony railings. “Where’s the learned gentleman?” asked Anthea. “There he is—below,” said the priest, who had come with them. “Your High Ji-jimmy is with the Kings.” The ten Kings were no longer alone. The learned gentleman—no one had noticed how he got there—stood with them on the steps of an altar, on which lay the dead body of the black bull. All the rest of the courtyard was thick with people, seemingly of all classes, and all were shouting, “The sea—the sea!” “Be calm,” said the most kingly of the Kings, he who had lassoed the bull. “Our town is strong against the thunders of the sea and of the sky!” “I want to go home,” whined the Psammead. “We can’t go without  him ,” said Anthea firmly. “Jimmy,” she called, “Jimmy!” and waved to him. He heard her, and began to come towards her through the crowd. They could see from the balcony the sea-captain edging his way out from among the people. And his face was dead white, like paper. “To the hills!” he cried in a loud and terrible voice. And above his voice came another voice, louder, more terrible—the voice of the sea. The girls looked seaward. Across the smooth distance of the sea something huge and black rolled towards the town. It was a wave, but a wave a hundred feet in height, a wave that looked like a mountain—a wave rising higher and higher till suddenly it seemed to break in two—one half of it rushed out to sea again; the other— “Oh!” cried Anthea, “the town—the poor people!” “It’s all thousands of years ago, really,” said Robert but his voice trembled. They hid their eyes for a moment. They could not bear to look down, for the wave had broken on the face of the town, sweeping over the quays and docks, overwhelming the great storehouses and factories, tearing gigantic stones from forts and bridges, and using them as battering rams against the temples. Great ships were swept over the roofs of the houses and dashed down halfway up the hill among ruined gardens and broken buildings. The water ground brown fishing-boats to powder on the golden roofs of Palaces. Then the wave swept back towards the sea. “I want to go home,” cried the Psammead fiercely. “Oh, yes, yes!” said Jane, and the boys were ready—but the learned gentleman had not come. Then suddenly they heard him dash up to the inner gallery, crying— “I  must  see the end of the dream.” He rushed up the higher flight. The others followed him. They found themselves in a sort of turret—roofed, but open to the air at the sides. The learned gentleman was leaning on the parapet, and as they rejoined him the vast wave rushed back on the town. This time it rose higher—destroyed more. “Come home,” cried the Psammead; “ that’s  the  last , I know it is! That’s the last—over there.” It pointed with a claw that trembled. “Oh, come!” cried Jane, holding up the Amulet. “I  will see  the end of the dream,” cried the learned gentleman. “You’ll never see anything else if you do,” said Cyril. “Oh,  Jimmy! ” appealed Anthea. “I’ll  never  bring you out again!” “You’ll never have the chance if you don’t go soon,” said the Psammead. “I  will  see the end of the dream,” said the learned gentleman obstinately. The hills around were black with people fleeing from the villages to the mountains. And even as they fled thin smoke broke from the great white peak, and then a faint flash of flame. Then the volcano began to throw up its mysterious fiery inside parts. The earth trembled; ashes and sulphur showered down; a rain of fine pumice-stone fell like snow on all the dry land. The elephants from the forest rushed up towards the peaks; great lizards thirty yards long broke from the mountain pools and rushed down towards the sea. The snows melted and rushed down, first in avalanches, then in roaring torrents. Great rocks cast up by the volcano fell splashing in the sea miles away. “Oh, this is horrible!” cried Anthea. “Come home, come home!” “The end of the dream,” gasped the learned gentleman. “Hold up the Amulet,” cried the Psammead suddenly. The place where they stood was now crowded with men and women, and the children were strained tight against the parapet. The turret rocked and swayed; the wave had reached the golden wall. Jane held up the Amulet. “Now,” cried the Psammead, “say the word!” And as Jane said it the Psammead leaped from its bag and bit the hand of the learned gentleman. At the same moment the boys pushed him through the arch and all followed him. He turned to look back, and through the arch he saw nothing but a waste of waters, with above it the peak of the terrible mountain with fire raging from it. He staggered back to his chair. “What a ghastly dream!” he gasped. “Oh, you’re here, my—er—dears. Can I do anything for you?” “You’ve hurt your hand,” said Anthea gently; “let me bind it up.” The hand was indeed bleeding rather badly. The Psammead had crept back to its bag. All the children were very white. “Never again,” said the Psammead later on, “will I go into the Past with a grown-up person! I will say for you four, you do do as you’re told.” “We didn’t even find the Amulet,” said Anthea later still. “Of course you didn’t; it wasn’t there. Only the stone it was made of was there. It fell on to a ship miles away that managed to escape and got to Egypt.  I  could have told you that.” “I wish you had,” said Anthea, and her voice was still rather shaky. “Why didn’t you?” “You never asked me,” said the Psammead very sulkily. “I’m not the sort of chap to go shoving my oar in where it’s not wanted.” “Mr Ji-jimmy’s friend will have something worth having to put in his article now,” said Cyril very much later indeed. “Not he,” said Robert sleepily. “The learned Ji-jimmy will think it’s a dream, and it’s ten to one he never tells the other chap a word about it at all.” Robert was quite right on both points. The learned gentleman did. And he never did. CHAPTER X. THE LITTLE BLACK GIRL AND JULIUS CAESAR A great city swept away by the sea, a beautiful country devastated by an active volcano—these are not the sort of things you see every day of the week. And when you do see them, no matter how many other wonders you may have seen in your time, such sights are rather apt to take your breath away. Atlantis had certainly this effect on the breaths of Cyril, Robert, Anthea, and Jane. They remained in a breathless state for some days. The learned gentleman seemed as breathless as anyone; he spent a good deal of what little breath he had in telling Anthea about a wonderful dream he had. “You would hardly believe,” he said, “that anyone  could  have such a detailed vision.” But Anthea could believe it, she said, quite easily. He had ceased to talk about thought-transference. He had now seen too many wonders to believe that. In consequence of their breathless condition none of the children suggested any new excursions through the Amulet. Robert voiced the mood of the others when he said that they were “fed up” with Amulet for a bit. They undoubtedly were. As for the Psammead, it went to sand and stayed there, worn out by the terror of the flood and the violent exercise it had had to take in obedience to the inconsiderate wishes of the learned gentleman and the Babylonian queen. The children let it sleep. The danger of taking it about among strange people who might at any moment utter undesirable wishes was becoming more and more plain. And there are pleasant things to be done in London without any aid from Amulets or Psammeads. You can, for instance visit the Tower of London, the Houses of Parliament, the National Gallery, the Zoological Gardens, the various Parks, the Museums at South Kensington, Madame Tussaud’s Exhibition of Waxworks, or the Botanical Gardens at Kew. You can go to Kew by river steamer—and this is the way that the children would have gone if they had gone at all. Only they never did, because it was when they were discussing the arrangements for the journey, and what they should take with them to eat and how much of it, and what the whole thing would cost, that the adventure of the Little Black Girl began to happen. The children were sitting on a seat in St James’s Park. They had been watching the pelican repulsing with careful dignity the advances of the seagulls who are always so anxious to play games with it. The pelican thinks, very properly, that it hasn’t the figure for games, so it spends most of its time pretending that that is not the reason why it won’t play. The breathlessness caused by Atlantis was wearing off a little. Cyril, who always wanted to understand all about everything, was turning things over in his mind. “I’m not; I’m only thinking,” he answered when Robert asked him what he was so grumpy about. “I’ll tell you when I’ve thought it all out.” “If it’s about the Amulet I don’t want to hear it,” said Jane. “Nobody asked you to,” retorted Cyril mildly, “and I haven’t finished my inside thinking about it yet. Let’s go to Kew in the meantime.” “I’d rather go in a steamer,” said Robert; and the girls laughed. “That’s right,” said Cyril, “ be  funny. I would.” “Well, he was, rather,” said Anthea. “I wouldn’t think, Squirrel, if it hurts you so,” said Robert kindly. “Oh, shut up,” said Cyril, “or else talk about Kew.” “I want to see the palms there,” said Anthea hastily, “to see if they’re anything like the ones on the island where we united the Cook and the Burglar by the Reverend Half-Curate.” All disagreeableness was swept away in a pleasant tide of recollections, and “Do you remember...?” they said. “Have you forgotten...?” “My hat!” remarked Cyril pensively, as the flood of reminiscence ebbed a little; “we have had some times.” “We have that,” said Robert. “Don’t let’s have any more,” said Jane anxiously. “That’s what I was thinking about,” Cyril replied; and just then they heard the Little Black Girl sniff. She was quite close to them. She was not really a little black girl. She was shabby and not very clean, and she had been crying so much that you could hardly see, through the narrow chink between her swollen lids, how very blue her eyes were. It was her dress that was black, and it was too big and too long for her, and she wore a speckled black-ribboned sailor hat that would have fitted a much bigger head than her little flaxen one. And she stood looking at the children and sniffing. “Oh, dear!” said Anthea, jumping up. “Whatever is the matter?” She put her hand on the little girl’s arm. It was rudely shaken off. “You leave me be,” said the little girl. “I ain’t doing nothing to you.” “But what is it?” Anthea asked. “Has someone been hurting you?” “What’s that to you?” said the little girl fiercely. “ You’re  all right.” “Come away,” said Robert, pulling at Anthea’s sleeve. “She’s a nasty, rude little kid.” “Oh, no,” said Anthea. “She’s only dreadfully unhappy. What is it?” she asked again. “Oh,  you’re  all right,” the child repeated; “ you  ain’t agoin’ to the Union.” “Can’t we take you home?” said Anthea; and Jane added, “Where does your mother live?” “She don’t live nowheres—she’s dead—so now!” said the little girl fiercely, in tones of miserable triumph. Then she opened her swollen eyes widely, stamped her foot in fury, and ran away. She ran no further than to the next bench, flung herself down there and began to cry without even trying not to. Anthea, quite at once, went to the little girl and put her arms as tight as she could round the hunched-up black figure. “Oh, don’t cry so, dear, don’t, don’t!” she whispered under the brim of the large sailor hat, now very crooked indeed. “Tell Anthea all about it; Anthea’lll help you. There, there, dear, don’t cry.” The others stood at a distance. One or two passers-by stared curiously. The child was now only crying part of the time; the rest of the time she seemed to be talking to Anthea. Presently Anthea beckoned Cyril. “It’s horrible!” she said in a furious whisper, “her father was a carpenter and he was a steady man, and never touched a drop except on a Saturday, and he came up to London for work, and there wasn’t any, and then he died; and her name is Imogen, and she’s nine come next November. And now her mother’s dead, and she’s to stay tonight with Mrs Shrobsall—that’s a landlady that’s been kind—and tomorrow the Relieving Officer is coming for her, and she’s going into the Union; that means the Workhouse. It’s too terrible. What can we do?” “Let’s ask the learned gentleman,” said Jane brightly. And as no one else could think of anything better the whole party walked back to Fitzroy Street as fast as it could, the little girl holding tight to Anthea’s hand and now not crying any more, only sniffing gently. The learned gentleman looked up from his writing with the smile that had grown much easier to him than it used to be. They were quite at home in his room now; it really seemed to welcome them. Even the mummy-case appeared to smile as if in its distant superior ancient Egyptian way it were rather pleased to see them than not. Anthea sat on the stairs with Imogen, who was nine come next November, while the others went in and explained the difficulty. The learned gentleman listened with grave attention. “It really does seem rather rough luck,” Cyril concluded, “because I’ve often heard about rich people who wanted children most awfully—though I know  I  never should—but they do. There must be somebody who’d be glad to have her.” “Gipsies are awfully fond of children,” Robert hopefully said. “They’re always stealing them. Perhaps they’d have her.” “She’s quite a nice little girl really,” Jane added; “she was only rude at first because we looked jolly and happy, and she wasn’t. You understand that, don’t you?” “Yes,” said he, absently fingering a little blue image from Egypt. “I understand that very well. As you say, there must be some home where she would be welcome.” He scowled thoughtfully at the little blue image. Anthea outside thought the explanation was taking a very long time. She was so busy trying to cheer and comfort the little black girl that she never noticed the Psammead who, roused from sleep by her voice, had shaken itself free of sand, and was coming crookedly up the stairs. It was close to her before she saw it. She picked it up and settled it in her lap. “What is it?” asked the black child. “Is it a cat or a organ-monkey, or what?” And then Anthea heard the learned gentleman say— “Yes, I wish we could find a home where they would be glad to have her,” and instantly she felt the Psammead begin to blow itself out as it sat on her lap. She jumped up lifting the Psammead in her skirt, and holding Imogen by the hand, rushed into the learned gentleman’s room. “At least let’s keep together,” she cried. “All hold hands—quick!” The circle was like that formed for the Mulberry Bush or Ring-o’-Roses. And Anthea was only able to take part in it by holding in her teeth the hem of her frock which, thus supported, formed a bag to hold the Psammead. “Is it a game?” asked the learned gentleman feebly. No one answered. There was a moment of suspense; then came that curious upside-down, inside-out sensation which one almost always feels when transported from one place to another by magic. Also there was that dizzy dimness of sight which comes on these occasions. The mist cleared, the upside-down, inside-out sensation subsided, and there stood the six in a ring, as before, only their twelve feet, instead of standing on the carpet of the learned gentleman’s room, stood on green grass. Above them, instead of the dusky ceiling of the Fitzroy Street floor, was a pale blue sky. And where the walls had been and the painted mummy-case, were tall dark green trees, oaks and ashes, and in between the trees and under them tangled bushes and creeping ivy. There were beech-trees too, but there was nothing under them but their own dead red drifted leaves, and here and there a delicate green fern-frond. And there they stood in a circle still holding hands, as though they were playing Ring-o’-Roses or the Mulberry Bush. Just six people hand in hand in a wood. That sounds simple, but then you must remember that they did not know  where  the wood was, and what’s more, they didn’t know  when  then wood was. There was a curious sort of feeling that made the learned gentleman say— “Another dream, dear me!” and made the children almost certain that they were in a time a very long while ago. As for little Imogen, she said, “Oh, my!” and kept her mouth very much open indeed. “Where are we?” Cyril asked the Psammead. “In Britain,” said the Psammead. “But when?” asked Anthea anxiously. “About the year fifty-five before the year you reckon time from,” said the Psammead crossly. “Is there anything else you want to know?” it added, sticking its head out of the bag formed by Anthea’s blue linen frock, and turning its snail’s eyes to right and left. “I’ve been here before—it’s very little changed.” “Yes, but why here?” asked Anthea. “Your inconsiderate friend,” the Psammead replied, “wished to find some home where they would be glad to have that unattractive and immature female human being whom you have picked up—gracious knows how. In Megatherium days properly brought-up children didn’t talk to shabby strangers in parks. Your thoughtless friend wanted a place where someone would be glad to have this undesirable stranger. And now here you are!” “I see we are,” said Anthea patiently, looking round on the tall gloom of the forest. “But why  here?  Why  now? ” “You don’t suppose anyone would want a child like that in  your  times—in  your  towns?” said the Psammead in irritated tones. “You’ve got your country into such a mess that there’s no room for half your children—and no one to want them.” “That’s not our doing, you know,” said Anthea gently. “And bringing me here without any waterproof or anything,” said the Psammead still more crossly, “when everyone knows how damp and foggy Ancient Britain was.” “Here, take my coat,” said Robert, taking it off. Anthea spread the coat on the ground and, putting the Psammead on it, folded it round so that only the eyes and furry ears showed. “There,” she said comfortingly. “Now if it does begin to look like rain, I can cover you up in a minute. Now what are we to do?” The others who had stopped holding hands crowded round to hear the answer to this question. Imogen whispered in an awed tone— “Can’t the organ monkey talk neither! I thought it was only parrots!” “Do?” replied the Psammead. “I don’t care what you do!” And it drew head and ears into the tweed covering of Robert’s coat. The others looked at each other. “It’s only a dream,” said the learned gentleman hopefully; “something is sure to happen if we can prevent ourselves from waking up.” And sure enough, something did. The brooding silence of the dark forest was broken by the laughter of children and the sound of voices. “Let’s go and see,” said Cyril. “It’s only a dream,” said the learned gentleman to Jane, who hung back; “if you don’t go with the tide of a dream—if you resist—you wake up, you know.” There was a sort of break in the undergrowth that was like a silly person’s idea of a path. They went along this in Indian file, the learned gentleman leading. Quite soon they came to a large clearing in the forest. There were a number of houses—huts perhaps you would have called them—with a sort of mud and wood fence. “It’s like the old Egyptian town,” whispered Anthea. And it was, rather. Some children, with no clothes on at all, were playing what looked like Ring-o’-Roses or Mulberry Bush. That is to say, they were dancing round in a ring, holding hands. On a grassy bank several women, dressed in blue and white robes and tunics of beast-skins sat watching the playing children. The children from Fitzroy Street stood on the fringe of the forest looking at the games. One woman with long, fair braided hair sat a little apart from the others, and there was a look in her eyes as she followed the play of the children that made Anthea feel sad and sorry. “None of those little girls is her own little girl,” thought Anthea. The little black-clad London child pulled at Anthea’s sleeve. “Look,” she said, “that one there—she’s precious like mother; mother’s “air was somethink lovely, when she “ad time to comb it out. Mother wouldn’t never a-beat me if she’d lived ’ere—I don’t suppose there’s e’er a public nearer than Epping, do you, Miss?” In her eagerness the child had stepped out of the shelter of the forest. The sad-eyed woman saw her. She stood up, her thin face lighted up with a radiance like sunrise, her long, lean arms stretched towards the London child. “Imogen!” she cried—at least the word was more like that than any other word—“Imogen!” There was a moment of great silence; the naked children paused in their play, the women on the bank stared anxiously. “Oh, it  is  mother—it  is! ” cried Imogen-from-London, and rushed across the cleared space. She and her mother clung together—so closely, so strongly that they stood an instant like a statue carved in stone. Then the women crowded round. “It  is  my Imogen!” cried the woman. “Oh it is! And she wasn’t eaten by wolves. She’s come back to me. Tell me, my darling, how did you escape? Where have you been? Who has fed and clothed you?” “I don’t know nothink,” said Imogen. “Poor child!” whispered the women who crowded round, “the terror of the wolves has turned her brain.” “But you know  me? ” said the fair-haired woman. And Imogen, clinging with black-clothed arms to the bare neck, answered— “Oh, yes, mother, I know  you  right ’nough.” “What is it? What do they say?” the learned gentleman asked anxiously. “You wished to come where someone wanted the child,” said the Psammead. “The child says this is her mother.” “And the mother?” “You can see,” said the Psammead. “But is she really? Her child, I mean?” “Who knows?” said the Psammead; “but each one fills the empty place in the other’s heart. It is enough.” “Oh,” said the learned gentleman, “this is a good dream. I wish the child might stay in the dream.” The Psammead blew itself out and granted the wish. So Imogen’s future was assured. She had found someone to want her. “If only all the children that no one wants,” began the learned gentleman—but the woman interrupted. She came towards them. “Welcome, all!” she cried. “I am the Queen, and my child tells me that you have befriended her; and this I well believe, looking on your faces. Your garb is strange, but faces I can read. The child is bewitched, I see that well, but in this she speaks truth. Is it not so?” The children said it wasn’t worth mentioning. I wish you could have seen all the honours and kindnesses lavished on the children and the learned gentleman by those ancient Britons. You would have thought, to see them, that a child was something to make a fuss about, not a bit of rubbish to be hustled about the streets and hidden away in the Workhouse. It wasn’t as grand as the entertainment at Babylon, but somehow it was more satisfying. “I think you children have some wonderful influence on me,” said the learned gentleman. “I never dreamed such dreams before I knew you.” It was when they were alone that night under the stars where the Britons had spread a heap Of dried fern for them to sleep on, that Cyril spoke. “Well,” he said, “we’ve made it all right for Imogen, and had a jolly good time. I vote we get home again before the fighting begins.” “What fighting?” asked Jane sleepily. “Why, Julius Caesar, you little goat,” replied her kind brother. “Don’t you see that if this is the year fifty-five, Julius Caesar may happen at any moment.” “I thought you liked Caesar,” said Robert. “So I do—in the history. But that’s different from being killed by his soldiers.” “If we saw Caesar we might persuade him not to,” said Anthea. “ You  persuade  Caesar ,” Robert laughed. The learned gentleman, before anyone could stop him, said, “I only wish we could see Caesar some time.” And, of course, in just the little time the Psammead took to blow itself out for wish-giving, the five, or six counting the Psammead, found themselves in Caesar’s camp, just outside Caesar’s tent. And they saw Caesar. The Psammead must have taken advantage of the loose wording of the learned gentleman’s wish, for it was not the same time of day as that on which the wish had been uttered among the dried ferns. It was sunset, and the great man sat on a chair outside his tent gazing over the sea towards Britain—everyone knew without being told that it was towards Britain. Two golden eagles on the top of posts stood on each side of the tent, and on the flaps of the tent which was very gorgeous to look at were the letters S.P.Q.R. The great man turned unchanged on the newcomers the august glance that he had turned on the violet waters of the Channel. Though they had suddenly appeared out of nothing, Caesar never showed by the faintest movement of an eyelid, by the least tightening of that firm mouth, that they were not some long expected embassy. He waved a calm hand towards the sentinels, who sprang weapons in hand towards the newcomers. “Back!” he said in a voice that thrilled like music. “Since when has Caesar feared children and students?” To the children he seemed to speak in the only language they knew; but the learned gentleman heard—in rather a strange accent, but quite intelligibly—the lips of Caesar speaking in the Latin tongue, and in that tongue, a little stiffly, he answered— “It is a dream, O Caesar.” “A dream?” repeated Caesar. “What is a dream?” “This,” said the learned gentleman. “Not it,” said Cyril, “it’s a sort of magic. We come out of another time and another place.” “And we want to ask you not to trouble about conquering Britain,” said Anthea; “it’s a poor little place, not worth bothering about.” “Are you from Britain?” the General asked. “Your clothes are uncouth, but well woven, and your hair is short as the hair of Roman citizens, not long like the hair of barbarians, yet such I deem you to be.” “We’re not,” said Jane with angry eagerness; “we’re not barbarians at all. We come from the country where the sun never sets, and we’ve read about you in books; and our country’s full of fine things—St Paul’s, and the Tower of London, and Madame Tussaud’s Exhibition, and—” Then the others stopped her. “Don’t talk nonsense,” said Robert in a bitter undertone. Caesar looked at the children a moment in silence. Then he called a soldier and spoke with him apart. Then he said aloud— “You three elder children may go where you will within the camp. Few children are privileged to see the camp of Caesar. The student and the smaller girl-child will remain here with me.” Nobody liked this; but when Caesar said a thing that thing was so, and there was an end to it. So the three went. Left alone with Jane and the learned gentleman, the great Roman found it easy enough to turn them inside out. But it was not easy, even for him, to make head or tail of the insides of their minds when he had got at them. The learned gentleman insisted that the whole thing was a dream, and refused to talk much, on the ground that if he did he would wake up. Jane, closely questioned, was full of information about railways, electric lights, balloons, men-of-war, cannons, and dynamite. “And do they fight with swords?” asked the General. “Yes, swords and guns and cannons.” Caesar wanted to know what guns were. “You fire them,” said Jane, “and they go bang, and people fall down dead.” “But what are guns like?” Jane found them hard to describe. “But Robert has a toy one in his pocket,” she said. So the others were recalled. The boys explained the pistol to Caesar very fully, and he looked at it with the greatest interest. It was a two-shilling pistol, the one that had done such good service in the old Egyptian village. “I shall cause guns to be made,” said Caesar, “and you will be detained till I know whether you have spoken the truth. I had just decided that Britain was not worth the bother of invading. But what you tell me decides me that it is very much worth while.” “But it’s all nonsense,” said Anthea. “Britain is just a savage sort of island—all fogs and trees and big rivers. But the people are kind. We know a little girl there named Imogen. And it’s no use your making guns because you can’t fire them without gunpowder, and that won’t be invented for hundreds of years, and we don’t know how to make it, and we can’t tell you. Do go straight home, dear Caesar, and let poor little Britain alone.” “But this other girl-child says—” said Caesar. “All Jane’s been telling you is what it’s going to be,” Anthea interrupted, “hundreds and hundreds of years from now.” “The little one is a prophetess, eh?” said Caesar, with a whimsical look. “Rather young for the business, isn’t she?” “You can call her a prophetess if you like,” said Cyril, “but what Anthea says is true.” “Anthea?” said Caesar. “That’s a Greek name.” “Very likely,” said Cyril, worriedly. “I say, I do wish you’d give up this idea of conquering Britain. It’s not worth while, really it isn’t!” “On the contrary,” said Caesar, “what you’ve told me has decided me to go, if it’s only to find out what Britain is really like. Guards, detain these children.” “Quick,” said Robert, “before the guards begin detaining. We had enough of that in Babylon.” Jane held up the Amulet away from the sunset, and said the word. The learned gentleman was pushed through and the others more quickly than ever before passed through the arch back into their own times and the quiet dusty sitting-room of the learned gentleman. It is a curious fact that when Caesar was encamped on the coast of Gaul—somewhere near Boulogne it was, I believe—he was sitting before his tent in the glow of the sunset, looking out over the violet waters of the English Channel. Suddenly he started, rubbed his eyes, and called his secretary. The young man came quickly from within the tent. “Marcus,” said Caesar. “I have dreamed a very wonderful dream. Some of it I forget, but I remember enough to decide what was not before determined. Tomorrow the ships that have been brought round from the Ligeris shall be provisioned. We shall sail for this three-cornered island. First, we will take but two legions. This, if what we have heard be true, should suffice. But if my dream be true, then a hundred legions will not suffice. For the dream I dreamed was the most wonderful that ever tormented the brain even of Caesar. And Caesar has dreamed some strange things in his time.” “And if you hadn’t told Caesar all that about how things are now, he’d never have invaded Britain,” said Robert to Jane as they sat down to tea. “Oh, nonsense,” said Anthea, pouring out; “it was all settled hundreds of years ago.” “I don’t know,” said Cyril. “Jam, please. This about time being only a thingummy of thought is very confusing. If everything happens at the same time—” “It  can’t! ” said Anthea stoutly, “the present’s the present and the past’s the past.” “Not always,” said Cyril. “When we were in the Past the present was the future. Now then!” he added triumphantly. And Anthea could not deny it. “I should have liked to see more of the camp,” said Robert. “Yes, we didn’t get much for our money—but Imogen is happy, that’s one thing,” said Anthea. “We left her happy in the Past. I’ve often seen about people being happy in the Past, in poetry books. I see what it means now.” “It’s not a bad idea,” said the Psammead sleepily, putting its head out of its bag and taking it in again suddenly, “being left in the Past.” Everyone remembered this afterwards, when— CHAPTER XI. BEFORE PHARAOH It was the day after the adventure of Julius Caesar and the Little Black Girl that Cyril, bursting into the bathroom to wash his hands for dinner (you have no idea how dirty they were, for he had been playing shipwrecked mariners all the morning on the leads at the back of the house, where the water-cistern is), found Anthea leaning her elbows on the edge of the bath, and crying steadily into it. “Hullo!” he said, with brotherly concern, “what’s up now? Dinner’ll be cold before you’ve got enough salt-water for a bath.” “Go away,” said Anthea fiercely. “I hate you! I hate everybody!” There was a stricken pause. “ I  didn’t know,” said Cyril tamely. “Nobody ever does know anything,” sobbed Anthea. “I didn’t know you were waxy. I thought you’d just hurt your fingers with the tap again like you did last week,” Cyril carefully explained. “Oh—fingers!” sneered Anthea through her sniffs. “Here, drop it, Panther,” he said uncomfortably. “You haven’t been having a row or anything?” “No,” she said. “Wash your horrid hands, for goodness’ sake, if that’s what you came for, or go.” Anthea was so seldom cross that when she was cross the others were always more surprised than angry. Cyril edged along the side of the bath and stood beside her. He put his hand on her arm. “Dry up, do,” he said, rather tenderly for him. And, finding that though she did not at once take his advice she did not seem to resent it, he put his arm awkwardly across her shoulders and rubbed his head against her ear. “There!” he said, in the tone of one administering a priceless cure for all possible sorrows. “Now, what’s up?” “Promise you won’t laugh?” “I don’t feel laughish myself,” said Cyril, dismally. “Well, then,” said Anthea, leaning her ear against his head, “it’s Mother.” “What’s the matter with Mother?” asked Cyril, with apparent want of sympathy. “She was all right in her letter this morning.” “Yes; but I want her so.” “You’re not the only one,” said Cyril briefly, and the brevity of his tone admitted a good deal. “Oh, yes,” said Anthea, “I know. We all want her all the time. But I want her now most dreadfully, awfully much. I never wanted anything so much. That Imogen child—the way the ancient British Queen cuddled her up! And Imogen wasn’t me, and the Queen was Mother. And then her letter this morning! And about The Lamb liking the salt bathing! And she bathed him in this very bath the night before she went away—oh, oh, oh!” Cyril thumped her on the back. “Cheer up,” he said. “You know my inside thinking that I was doing? Well, that was partly about Mother. We’ll soon get her back. If you’ll chuck it, like a sensible kid, and wash your face, I’ll tell you about it. That’s right. You let me get to the tap. Can’t you stop crying? Shall I put the door-key down your back?” “That’s for noses,” said Anthea, “and I’m not a kid any more than you are,” but she laughed a little, and her mouth began to get back into its proper shape. You know what an odd shape your mouth gets into when you cry in earnest. “Look here,” said Cyril, working the soap round and round between his hands in a thick slime of grey soapsuds. “I’ve been thinking. We’ve only just  played  with the Amulet so far. We’ve got to  work  it now—work it for all it’s worth. And it isn’t only Mother either. There’s Father out there all among the fighting. I don’t howl about it, but I  think —Oh, bother the soap!” The grey-lined soap had squirted out under the pressure of his fingers, and had hit Anthea’s chin with as much force as though it had been shot from a catapult. “There now,” she said regretfully, “now I shall have to wash my face.” “You’d have had to do that anyway,” said Cyril with conviction. “Now, my idea’s this. You know missionaries?” “Yes,” said Anthea, who did not know a single one. “Well, they always take the savages beads and brandy, and stays, and hats, and braces, and really useful things—things the savages haven’t got, and never heard about. And the savages love them for their kind generousness, and give them pearls, and shells, and ivory, and cassowaries. And that’s the way—” “Wait a sec,” said Anthea, splashing. “I can’t hear what you’re saying. Shells and—” “Shells, and things like that. The great thing is to get people to love you by being generous. And that’s what we’ve got to do. Next time we go into the Past we’ll regularly fit out the expedition. You remember how the Babylonian Queen froze on to that pocket-book? Well, we’ll take things like that. And offer them in exchange for a sight of the Amulet.” “A sight of it is not much good.” “No, silly. But, don’t you see, when we’ve seen it we shall know where it is, and we can go and take it in the night when everybody is asleep.” “It wouldn’t be stealing, would it?” said Anthea thoughtfully, “because it will be such an awfully long time ago when we do it. Oh, there’s that bell again.” As soon as dinner was eaten (it was tinned salmon and lettuce, and a jam tart), and the cloth cleared away, the idea was explained to the others, and the Psammead was aroused from sand, and asked what it thought would be good merchandise with which to buy the affection of say, the Ancient Egyptians, and whether it thought the Amulet was likely to be found in the Court of Pharaoh. But it shook its head, and shot out its snail’s eyes hopelessly. “I’m not allowed to play in this game,” it said. “Of course I  could  find out in a minute where the thing was, only I mayn’t. But I may go so far as to own that your idea of taking things with you isn’t a bad one. And I shouldn’t show them all at once. Take small things and conceal them craftily about your persons.” This advice seemed good. Soon the table was littered over with things which the children thought likely to interest the Ancient Egyptians. Anthea brought dolls, puzzle blocks, a wooden tea-service, a green leather case with  Nécessaire  written on it in gold letters. Aunt Emma had once given it to Anthea, and it had then contained scissors, penknife, bodkin, stiletto, thimble, corkscrew, and glove-buttoner. The scissors, knife, and thimble, and penknife were, of course, lost, but the other things were there and as good as new. Cyril contributed lead soldiers, a cannon, a catapult, a tin-opener, a tie-clip, and a tennis ball, and a padlock—no key. Robert collected a candle (“I don’t suppose they ever saw a self-fitting paraffin one,” he said), a penny Japanese pin-tray, a rubber stamp with his father’s name and address on it, and a piece of putty. Jane added a key-ring, the brass handle of a poker, a pot that had held cold-cream, a smoked pearl button off her winter coat, and a key—no lock. “We can’t take all this rubbish,” said Robert, with some scorn. “We must just each choose one thing.” The afternoon passed very agreeably in the attempt to choose from the table the four most suitable objects. But the four children could not agree what was suitable, and at last Cyril said— “Look here, let’s each be blindfolded and reach out, and the first thing you touch you stick to.” This was done. Cyril touched the padlock. Anthea got the  Nécessaire . Robert clutched the candle. Jane picked up the tie-clip. “It’s not much,” she said. “I don’t believe Ancient Egyptians wore ties.” “Never mind,” said Anthea. “I believe it’s luckier not to really choose. In the stories it’s always the thing the wood-cutter’s son picks up in the forest, and almost throws away because he thinks it’s no good, that turns out to be the magic thing in the end; or else someone’s lost it, and he is rewarded with the hand of the King’s daughter in marriage.” “I don’t want any hands in marriage, thank you.” said Cyril firmly. “Nor yet me,” said Robert. “It’s always the end of the adventures when it comes to the marriage hands.” “ Are  we ready?” said Anthea. “It  is  Egypt we’re going to, isn’t it?—nice Egypt?” said Jane. “I won’t go anywhere I don’t know about—like that dreadful big-wavy burning-mountain city,” she insisted. Then the Psammead was coaxed into its bag. “I say,” said Cyril suddenly, “I’m rather sick of kings. And people notice you so in palaces. Besides the Amulet’s sure to be in a Temple. Let’s just go among the common people, and try to work ourselves up by degrees. We might get taken on as Temple assistants.” “Like beadles,” said Anthea, “or vergers. They must have splendid chances of stealing the Temple treasures.” “Righto!” was the general rejoinder. The charm was held up. It grew big once again, and once again the warm golden Eastern light glowed softly beyond it. As the children stepped through it loud and furious voices rang in their ears. They went suddenly from the quiet of Fitzroy Street dining-room into a very angry Eastern crowd, a crowd much too angry to notice them. They edged through it to the wall of a house and stood there. The crowd was of men, women, and children. They were of all sorts of complexions, and pictures of them might have been coloured by any child with a shilling paint-box. The colours that child would have used for complexions would have been yellow ochre, red ochre, light red, sepia, and indian ink. But their faces were painted already—black eyebrows and lashes, and some red lips. The women wore a sort of pinafore with shoulder straps, and loose things wound round their heads and shoulders. The men wore very little clothing—for they were the working people—and the Egyptian boys and girls wore nothing at all, unless you count the little ornaments hung on chains round their necks and waists. The children saw all this before they could hear anything distinctly. Everyone was shouting so. But a voice sounded above the other voices, and presently it was speaking in a silence. “Comrades and fellow workers,” it said, and it was the voice of a tall, coppery-coloured man who had climbed into a chariot that had been stopped by the crowd. Its owner had bolted, muttering something about calling the Guards, and now the man spoke from it. “Comrades and fellow workers, how long are we to endure the tyranny of our masters, who live in idleness and luxury on the fruit of our toil? They only give us a bare subsistence wage, and they live on the fat of the land. We labour all our lives to keep them in wanton luxury. Let us make an end of it!” A roar of applause answered him. “How are you going to do it?” cried a voice. “You look out,” cried another, “or you’ll get yourself into trouble.” “I’ve heard almost every single word of that,” whispered Robert, “in Hyde Park last Sunday!” “Let us strike for more bread and onions and beer, and a longer mid-day rest,” the speaker went on. “You are tired, you are hungry, you are thirsty. You are poor, your wives and children are pining for food. The barns of the rich are full to bursting with the corn we want, the corn our labour has grown. To the granaries!” “To the granaries!” cried half the crowd; but another voice shouted clear above the tumult, “To Pharaoh! To the King! Let’s present a petition to the King! He will listen to the voice of the oppressed!” For a moment the crowd swayed one way and another—first towards the granaries and then towards the palace. Then, with a rush like that of an imprisoned torrent suddenly set free, it surged along the street towards the palace, and the children were carried with it. Anthea found it difficult to keep the Psammead from being squeezed very uncomfortably. The crowd swept through the streets of dull-looking houses with few windows, very high up, across the market where people were not buying but exchanging goods. In a momentary pause Robert saw a basket of onions exchanged for a hair comb and five fish for a string of beads. The people in the market seemed better off than those in the crowd; they had finer clothes, and more of them. They were the kind of people who, nowadays, would have lived at Brixton or Brockley. “What’s the trouble now?” a languid, large-eyed lady in a crimped, half-transparent linen dress, with her black hair very much braided and puffed out, asked of a date-seller. “Oh, the working-men—discontented as usual,” the man answered. “Listen to them. Anyone would think it mattered whether they had a little more or less to eat. Dregs of society!” said the date-seller. “Scum!” said the lady. “And I’ve heard  that  before, too,” said Robert. At that moment the voice of the crowd changed, from anger to doubt, from doubt to fear. There were other voices shouting; they shouted defiance and menace, and they came nearer very quickly. There was the rattle of wheels and the pounding of hoofs. A voice shouted, “Guards!” “The Guards! The Guards!” shouted another voice, and the crowd of workmen took up the cry. “The Guards! Pharaoh’s Guards!” And swaying a little once more, the crowd hung for a moment as it were balanced. Then as the trampling hoofs came nearer the workmen fled dispersed, up alleys and into the courts of houses, and the Guards in their embossed leather chariots swept down the street at the gallop, their wheels clattering over the stones, and their dark-coloured, blue tunics blown open and back with the wind of their going. “So  that  riot’s over,” said the crimped-linen-dressed lady; “that’s a blessing! And did you notice the Captain of the Guard? What a very handsome man he was, to be sure!” The four children had taken advantage of the moment’s pause before the crowd turned to fly, to edge themselves and drag each other into an arched doorway. Now they each drew a long breath and looked at the others. “We’re well out of  that ,” said Cyril. “Yes,” said Anthea, “but I do wish the poor men hadn’t been driven back before they could get to the King. He might have done something for them.” “Not if he was the one in the Bible he wouldn’t,” said Jane. “He had a hard heart.” “Ah, that was the Moses one,” Anthea explained. “The Joseph one was quite different. I should like to see Pharaoh’s house. I wonder whether it’s like the Egyptian Court in the Crystal Palace.” “I thought we decided to try to get taken on in a Temple,” said Cyril in injured tones. “Yes, but we’ve got to know someone first. Couldn’t we make friends with a Temple doorkeeper—we might give him the padlock or something. I wonder which are temples and which are palaces,” Robert added, glancing across the market-place to where an enormous gateway with huge side buildings towered towards the sky. To right and left of it were other buildings only a little less magnificent. “Did you wish to seek out the Temple of Amen Rā?” asked a soft voice behind them, “or the Temple of Mut, or the Temple of Khonsu?” They turned to find beside them a young man. He was shaved clean from head to foot, and on his feet were light papyrus sandals. He was clothed in a linen tunic of white, embroidered heavily in colours. He was gay with anklets, bracelets, and armlets of gold, richly inlaid. He wore a ring on his finger, and he had a short jacket of gold embroidery something like the Zouave soldiers wear, and on his neck was a gold collar with many amulets hanging from it. But among the amulets the children could see none like theirs. “It doesn’t matter which Temple,” said Cyril frankly. “Tell me your mission,” said the young man. “I am a divine father of the Temple of Amen Rā and perhaps I can help you.” “Well,” said Cyril, “we’ve come from the great Empire on which the sun never sets.” “I thought somehow that you’d come from some odd, out-of-the-way spot,” said the priest with courtesy. “And we’ve seen a good many palaces. We thought we should like to see a Temple, for a change,” said Robert. The Psammead stirred uneasily in its embroidered bag. “Have you brought gifts to the Temple?” asked the priest cautiously. “We  have  got some gifts,” said Cyril with equal caution. “You see there’s magic mixed up in it. So we can’t tell you everything. But we don’t want to give our gifts for nothing.” “Beware how you insult the god,” said the priest sternly. “I also can do magic. I can make a waxen image of you, and I can say words which, as the wax image melts before the fire, will make you dwindle away and at last perish miserably.” “Pooh!” said Cyril stoutly, “that’s nothing. I can make  fire  itself!” “I should jolly well like to see you do it,” said the priest unbelievingly. “Well, you shall,” said Cyril, “nothing easier. Just stand close round me.” “Do you need no preparation—no fasting, no incantations?” The priest’s tone was incredulous. “The incantation’s quite short,” said Cyril, taking the hint; “and as for fasting, it’s not needed in  my  sort of magic. Union Jack, Printing Press, Gunpowder, Rule Britannia! Come, Fire, at the end of this little stick!” He had pulled a match from his pocket, and as he ended the incantation which contained no words that it seemed likely the Egyptian had ever heard he stooped in the little crowd of his relations and the priest and struck the match on his boot. He stood up, shielding the flame with one hand. “See?” he said, with modest pride. “Here, take it into your hand.” “No, thank you,” said the priest, swiftly backing. “Can you do that again?” “Yes.” “Then come with me to the great double house of Pharaoh. He loves good magic, and he will raise you to honour and glory. There’s no need of secrets between initiates,” he went on confidentially. “The fact is, I am out of favour at present owing to a little matter of failure of prophecy. I told him a beautiful princess would be sent to him from Syria, and, lo! a woman thirty years old arrived. But she  was  a beautiful woman not so long ago. Time is only a mode of thought, you know.” The children thrilled to the familiar words. “So you know that too, do you?” said Cyril. “It is part of the mystery of all magic, is it not?” said the priest. “Now if I bring you to Pharaoh the little unpleasantness I spoke of will be forgotten. And I will ask Pharaoh, the Great House, Son of the Sun, and Lord of the South and North, to decree that you shall lodge in the Temple. Then you can have a good look round, and teach me your magic. And I will teach you mine.” This idea seemed good—at least it was better than any other which at that moment occurred to anybody, so they followed the priest through the city. The streets were very narrow and dirty. The best houses, the priest explained, were built within walls twenty to twenty-five feet high, and such windows as showed in the walls were very high up. The tops of palm-trees showed above the walls. The poor people’s houses were little square huts with a door and two windows, and smoke coming out of a hole in the back. “The poor Egyptians haven’t improved so very much in their building since the first time we came to Egypt,” whispered Cyril to Anthea. The huts were roofed with palm branches, and everywhere there were chickens, and goats, and little naked children kicking about in the yellow dust. On one roof was a goat, who had climbed up and was eating the dry palm-leaves with snorts and head-tossings of delight. Over every house door was some sort of figure or shape. “Amulets,” the priest explained, “to keep off the evil eye.” “I don’t think much of your ‘nice Egypt’,” Robert whispered to Jane; “it’s simply not a patch on Babylon.” “Ah, you wait till you see the palace,” Jane whispered back. The palace was indeed much more magnificent than anything they had yet seen that day, though it would have made but a poor show beside that of the Babylonian King. They came to it through a great square pillared doorway of sandstone that stood in a high brick wall. The shut doors were of massive cedar, with bronze hinges, and were studded with bronze nails. At the side was a little door and a wicket gate, and through this the priest led the children. He seemed to know a word that made the sentries make way for him. Inside was a garden, planted with hundreds of different kinds of trees and flowering shrubs, a lake full of fish, with blue lotus flowers at the margin, and ducks swimming about cheerfully, and looking, as Jane said, quite modern. “The guard-chamber, the store-houses, the queen’s house,” said the priest, pointing them out. They passed through open courtyards, paved with flat stones, and the priest whispered to a guard at a great inner gate. “We are fortunate,” he said to the children, “Pharaoh is even now in the Court of Honour. Now, don’t forget to be overcome with respect and admiration. It won’t do any harm if you fall flat on your faces. And whatever you do, don’t speak until you’re spoken to.” “There used to be that rule in our country,” said Robert, “when my father was a little boy.” At the outer end of the great hall a crowd of people were arguing with and even shoving the Guards, who seemed to make it a rule not to let anyone through unless they were bribed to do it. The children heard several promises of the utmost richness, and wondered whether they would ever be kept. All round the hall were pillars of painted wood. The roof was of cedar, gorgeously inlaid. About half-way up the hall was a wide, shallow step that went right across the hall; then a little farther on another; and then a steep flight of narrower steps, leading right up to the throne on which Pharaoh sat. He sat there very splendid, his red and white double crown on his head, and his sceptre in his hand. The throne had a canopy of wood and wooden pillars painted in bright colours. On a low, broad bench that ran all round the hall sat the friends, relatives, and courtiers of the King, leaning on richly-covered cushions. The priest led the children up the steps till they all stood before the throne; and then, suddenly, he fell on his face with hands outstretched. The others did the same, Anthea falling very carefully because of the Psammead. “Raise them,” said the voice of Pharaoh, “that they may speak to me.” The officers of the King’s household raised them. “Who are these strangers?” Pharaoh asked, and added very crossly, “And what do you mean, Rekh-marā, by daring to come into my presence while your innocence is not established?” “Oh, great King,” said the young priest, “you are the very image of Rā, and the likeness of his son Horus in every respect. You know the thoughts of the hearts of the gods and of men, and you have divined that these strangers are the children of the children of the vile and conquered Kings of the Empire where the sun never sets. They know a magic not known to the Egyptians. And they come with gifts in their hands as tribute to Pharaoh, in whose heart is the wisdom of the gods, and on his lips their truth.” “That is all very well,” said Pharaoh, “but where are the gifts?” The children, bowing as well as they could in their embarrassment at finding themselves the centre of interest in a circle more grand, more golden and more highly coloured than they could have imagined possible, pulled out the padlock, the  Nécessaire , and the tie-clip. “But it’s not tribute all the same,” Cyril muttered. “England doesn’t pay tribute!” Pharaoh examined all the things with great interest when the chief of the household had taken them up to him. “Deliver them to the Keeper of the Treasury,” he said to one near him. And to the children he said— “A small tribute, truly, but strange, and not without worth. And the magic, O Rekh-marā?” “These unworthy sons of a conquered nation...” began Rekh-marā. “Nothing of the kind!” Cyril whispered angrily. “... of a vile and conquered nation, can make fire to spring from dry wood—in the sight of all.” “I should jolly well like to see them do it,” said Pharaoh, just as the priest had done. So Cyril, without more ado, did it. “Do more magic,” said the King, with simple appreciation. “He cannot do any more magic,” said Anthea suddenly, and all eyes were turned on her, “because of the voice of the free people who are shouting for bread and onions and beer and a long mid-day rest. If the people had what they wanted, he could do more.” “A rude-spoken girl,” said Pharaoh. “But give the dogs what they want,” he said, without turning his head. “Let them have their rest and their extra rations. There are plenty of slaves to work.” A richly-dressed official hurried out. “You will be the idol of the people,” Rekh-marā whispered joyously; “the Temple of Amen will not contain their offerings.” Cyril struck another match, and all the court was overwhelmed with delight and wonder. And when Cyril took the candle from his pocket and lighted it with the match, and then held the burning candle up before the King the enthusiasm knew no bounds. “Oh, greatest of all, before whom sun and moon and stars bow down,” said Rekh-marā insinuatingly, “am I pardoned? Is my innocence made plain?” “As plain as it ever will be, I daresay,” said Pharaoh shortly. “Get along with you. You are pardoned. Go in peace.” The priest went with lightning swiftness. “And what,” said the King suddenly, “is it that moves in that sack? Show me, oh strangers.” There was nothing for it but to show the Psammead. “Seize it,” said Pharaoh carelessly. “A very curious monkey. It will be a nice little novelty for my wild beast collection.” And instantly, the entreaties of the children availing as little as the bites of the Psammead, though both bites and entreaties were fervent, it was carried away from before their eyes. “Oh,  do  be careful!” cried Anthea. “At least keep it dry! Keep it in its sacred house!” She held up the embroidered bag. “It’s a magic creature,” cried Robert; “it’s simply priceless!” “You’ve no right to take it away,” cried Jane incautiously. “It’s a shame, a barefaced robbery, that’s what it is!” There was an awful silence. Then Pharaoh spoke. “Take the sacred house of the beast from them,” he said, “and imprison all. Tonight after supper it may be our pleasure to see more magic. Guard them well, and do not torture them—yet!” “Oh, dear!” sobbed Jane, as they were led away. “I knew exactly what it would be! Oh, I wish you hadn’t!” “Shut up, silly,” said Cyril. “You know you  would  come to Egypt. It was your own idea entirely. Shut up. It’ll be all right.” “I thought we should play ball with queens,” sobbed Jane, “and have no end of larks! And now everything’s going to be perfectly horrid!” The room they were shut up in  was  a room, and not a dungeon, as the elder ones had feared. That, as Anthea said, was one comfort. There were paintings on the wall that at any other time would have been most interesting. And a sort of low couch, and chairs. When they were alone Jane breathed a sigh of relief. “Now we can get home all right,” she said. “And leave the Psammead?” said Anthea reproachfully. “Wait a sec. I’ve got an idea,” said Cyril. He pondered for a few moments. Then he began hammering on the heavy cedar door. It opened, and a guard put in his head. “Stop that row,” he said sternly, “or—” “Look here,” Cyril interrupted, “it’s very dull for you isn’t it? Just doing nothing but guard us. Wouldn’t you like to see some magic? We’re not too proud to do it for you. Wouldn’t you like to see it?” “I don’t mind if I do,” said the guard. “Well then, you get us that monkey of ours that was taken away, and we’ll show you.” “How do I know you’re not making game of me?” asked the soldier. “Shouldn’t wonder if you only wanted to get the creature so as to set it on me. I daresay its teeth and claws are poisonous.” “Well, look here,” said Robert. “You see we’ve got nothing with us? You just shut the door, and open it again in five minutes, and we’ll have got a magic—oh, I don’t know—a magic flower in a pot for you.” “If you can do that you can do anything,” said the soldier, and he went out and barred the door. Then, of course, they held up the Amulet. They found the East by holding it up, and turning slowly till the Amulet began to grow big, walked home through it, and came back with a geranium in full scarlet flower from the staircase window of the Fitzroy Street house. “Well!” said the soldier when he came in. “I really am—!” “We can do much more wonderful things than that—oh, ever so much,” said Anthea persuasively, “if we only have our monkey. And here’s twopence for yourself.” The soldier looked at the twopence. “What’s this?” he said. Robert explained how much simpler it was to pay money for things than to exchange them as the people were doing in the market. Later on the soldier gave the coins to his captain, who, later still, showed them to Pharaoh, who of course kept them and was much struck with the idea. That was really how coins first came to be used in Egypt. You will not believe this, I daresay, but really, if you believe the rest of the story, I don’t see why you shouldn’t believe this as well. “I say,” said Anthea, struck by a sudden thought, “I suppose it’ll be all right about those workmen? The King won’t go back on what he said about them just because he’s angry with us?” “Oh, no,” said the soldier, “you see, he’s rather afraid of magic. He’ll keep to his word right enough.” “Then  that’s  all right,” said Robert; and Anthea said softly and coaxingly— “Ah,  do  get us the monkey, and then you’ll see some lovely magic. Do—there’s a nice, kind soldier.” “I don’t know where they’ve put your precious monkey, but if I can get another chap to take on my duty here I’ll see what I can do,” he said grudgingly, and went out. “Do you mean,” said Robert, “that we’re going off without even  trying  for the other half of the Amulet?” “I really think we’d better,” said Anthea tremulously. “Of course the other half of the Amulet’s here somewhere or our half wouldn’t have brought us here. I do wish we could find it. It is a pity we don’t know any  real  magic. Then we could find out. I do wonder where it is—exactly.” If they had only known it, something very like the other half of the Amulet was very near them. It hung round the neck of someone, and that someone was watching them through a chink, high up in the wall, specially devised for watching people who were imprisoned. But they did not know. There was nearly an hour of anxious waiting. They tried to take an interest in the picture on the wall, a picture of harpers playing very odd harps and women dancing at a feast. They examined the painted plaster floor, and the chairs were of white painted wood with coloured stripes at intervals. But the time went slowly, and everyone had time to think of how Pharaoh had said, “Don’t torture them— yet .” “If the worst comes to the worst,” said Cyril, “we must just bunk, and leave the Psammead. I believe it can take care of itself well enough. They won’t kill it or hurt it when they find it can speak and give wishes. They’ll build it a temple, I shouldn’t wonder.” “I couldn’t bear to go without it,” said Anthea, “and Pharaoh said ‘After supper’, that won’t be just yet. And the soldier  was  curious. I’m sure we’re all right for the present.” All the same, the sounds of the door being unbarred seemed one of the prettiest sounds possible. “Suppose he hasn’t got the Psammead?” whispered Jane. But that doubt was set at rest by the Psammead itself; for almost before the door was open it sprang through the chink of it into Anthea’s arms, shivering and hunching up its fur. “Here’s its fancy overcoat,” said the soldier, holding out the bag, into which the Psammead immediately crept. “Now,” said Cyril, “what would you like us to do? Anything you’d like us to get for you?” “Any little trick you like,” said the soldier. “If you can get a strange flower blooming in an earthenware vase you can get anything, I suppose,” he said. “I just wish I’d got two men’s loads of jewels from the King’s treasury. That’s what I’ve always wished for.” At the word “ wish ” the children knew that the Psammead would attend to  that  bit of magic. It did, and the floor was littered with a spreading heap of gold and precious stones. “Any other little trick?” asked Cyril loftily. “Shall we become invisible? Vanish?” “Yes, if you like,” said the soldier; “but not through the door, you don’t.” He closed it carefully and set his broad Egyptian back against it. “No! no!” cried a voice high up among the tops of the tall wooden pillars that stood against the wall. There was a sound of someone moving above. The soldier was as much surprised as anybody. “That’s magic, if you like,” he said. And then Jane held up the Amulet, uttering the word of Power. At the sound of it and at the sight of the Amulet growing into the great arch the soldier fell flat on his face among the jewels with a cry of awe and terror. The children went through the arch with a quickness born of long practice. But Jane stayed in the middle of the arch and looked back. The others, standing on the dining-room carpet in Fitzroy Street, turned and saw her still in the arch. “Someone’s holding her,” cried Cyril. “We must go back.” But they pulled at Jane’s hands just to see if she would come, and, of course, she did come. Then, as usual, the arch was little again and there they all were. “Oh, I do wish you hadn’t!” Jane said crossly. “It  was  so interesting. The priest had come in and he was kicking the soldier, and telling him he’d done it now, and they must take the jewels and flee for their lives.” “And did they?” “I don’t know. You interfered,” said Jane ungratefully. “I  should  have liked to see the last of it.” As a matter of fact, none of them had seen the last of it—if by “it” Jane meant the adventure of the Priest and the Soldier. CHAPTER XII. THE SORRY-PRESENT AND THE EXPELLED LITTLE BOY “Look here, said Cyril, sitting on the dining-table and swinging his legs; “I really have got it.” “Got what?” was the not unnatural rejoinder of the others. Cyril was making a boat with a penknife and a piece of wood, and the girls were making warm frocks for their dolls, for the weather was growing chilly. “Why, don’t you see? It’s really not any good our going into the Past looking for that Amulet. The Past’s as full of different times as—as the sea is of sand. We’re simply bound to hit upon the wrong time. We might spend our lives looking for the Amulet and never see a sight of it. Why, it’s the end of September already. It’s like looking for a needle in—” “A bottle of hay—I know,” interrupted Robert; “but if we don’t go on doing that, what ARE we to do?” “That’s just it,” said Cyril in mysterious accents. “Oh,  bother! ” Old Nurse had come in with the tray of knives, forks, and glasses, and was getting the tablecloth and table-napkins out of the chiffonier drawer. “It’s always meal-times just when you come to anything interesting.” “And a nice interesting handful  you’d  be, Master Cyril,” said old Nurse, “if I wasn’t to bring your meals up to time. Don’t you begin grumbling now, fear you get something to grumble  at .” “I wasn’t grumbling,” said Cyril quite untruly; “but it does always happen like that.” “You deserve to  have  something happen,” said old Nurse. “Slave, slave, slave for you day and night, and never a word of thanks. ...” “Why, you do everything beautifully,” said Anthea. “It’s the first time any of you’s troubled to say so, anyhow,” said Nurse shortly. “What’s the use of  saying? ” inquired Robert. “We  eat  our meals fast enough, and almost always two helps.  That  ought to show you!” “Ah!” said old Nurse, going round the table and putting the knives and forks in their places; “you’re a man all over, Master Robert. There was my poor Green, all the years he lived with me I never could get more out of him than ‘It’s all right!’ when I asked him if he’d fancied his dinner. And yet, when he lay a-dying, his last words to me was, ‘Maria, you was always a good cook!’” She ended with a trembling voice. “And so you are,” cried Anthea, and she and Jane instantly hugged her. When she had gone out of the room Anthea said— “I know exactly how she feels. Now, look here! Let’s do a penance to show we’re sorry we didn’t think about telling her before what nice cooking she does, and what a dear she is.” “Penances are silly,” said Robert. “Not if the penance is something to please someone else. I didn’t mean old peas and hair shirts and sleeping on the stones. I mean we’ll make her a sorry-present,” explained Anthea. “Look here! I vote Cyril doesn’t tell us his idea until we’ve done something for old Nurse. It’s worse for us than him,” she added hastily, “because he knows what it is and we don’t. Do you all agree?” The others would have been ashamed not to agree, so they did. It was not till quite near the end of dinner—mutton fritters and blackberry and apple pie—that out of the earnest talk of the four came an idea that pleased everybody and would, they hoped, please Nurse. Cyril and Robert went out with the taste of apple still in their mouths and the purple of blackberries on their lips—and, in the case of Robert, on the wristband as well—and bought a big sheet of cardboard at the stationers. Then at the plumber’s shop, that has tubes and pipes and taps and gas-fittings in the window, they bought a pane of glass the same size as the cardboard. The man cut it with a very interesting tool that had a bit of diamond at the end, and he gave them, out of his own free generousness, a large piece of putty and a small piece of glue. While they were out the girls had floated four photographs of the four children off their cards in hot water. These were now stuck in a row along the top of the cardboard. Cyril put the glue to melt in a jampot, and put the jampot in a saucepan and saucepan on the fire, while Robert painted a wreath of poppies round the photographs. He painted rather well and very quickly, and poppies are easy to do if you’ve once been shown how. Then Anthea drew some printed letters and Jane coloured them. The words were: “With all our loves to shew We like the thigs to eat.” And when the painting was dry they all signed their names at the bottom and put the glass on, and glued brown paper round the edge and over the back, and put two loops of tape to hang it up by. Of course everyone saw when too late that there were not enough letters in “things”, so the missing “n”was put in. It was impossible, of course, to do the whole thing over again for just one letter. “There!” said Anthea, placing it carefully, face up, under the sofa. “It’ll be hours before the glue’s dry. Now, Squirrel, fire ahead!” “Well, then,” said Cyril in a great hurry, rubbing at his gluey hands with his pocket handkerchief. “What I mean to say is this.” There was a long pause. “Well,” said Robert at last, “ what  is it that you mean to say?” “It’s like this,” said Cyril, and again stopped short. “Like  what? ” asked Jane. “How can I tell you if you will all keep on interrupting?” said Cyril sharply. So no one said any more, and with wrinkled frowns he arranged his ideas. “Look here,” he said, “what I really mean is—we can remember now what we did when we went to look for the Amulet. And if we’d found it we should remember that too.” “Rather!” said Robert. “Only, you see we haven’t.” “But in the future we shall have.” “Shall we, though?” said Jane. “Yes—unless we’ve been made fools of by the Psammead. So then, where we want to go to is where we shall remember about where we did find it.” “I see,” said Robert, but he didn’t. “ I  don’t,” said Anthea, who did, very nearly. “Say it again, Squirrel, and very slowly.” “If,” said Cyril, very slowly indeed, “we go into the future—after we’ve found the Amulet—” “But we’ve got to find it first,” said Jane. “Hush!” said Anthea. “There will be a future,” said Cyril, driven to greater clearness by the blank faces of the other three, “there will be a time  after  we’ve found it. Let’s go into  that  time—and then we shall remember  how  we found it. And then we can go back and do the finding really.” “I see,” said Robert, and this time he did, and I hope  you  do. “Yes,” said Anthea. “Oh, Squirrel, how clever of you!” “But will the Amulet work both ways?” inquired Robert. “It ought to,” said Cyril, “if time’s only a thingummy of whatsitsname. Anyway we might try.” “Let’s put on our best things, then,” urged Jane. “You know what people say about progress and the world growing better and brighter. I expect people will be awfully smart in the future.” “All right,” said Anthea, “we should have to wash anyway, I’m all thick with glue.” When everyone was clean and dressed, the charm was held up. “We want to go into the future and see the Amulet after we’ve found it,” said Cyril, and Jane said the word of Power. They walked through the big arch of the charm straight into the British Museum. They knew it at once, and there, right in front of them, under a glass case, was the Amulet—their own half of it, as well as the other half they had never been able to find—and the two were joined by a pin of red stone that formed a hinge. “Oh, glorious!” cried Robert. “Here it is!” “Yes,” said Cyril, very gloomily, “here it is. But we can’t get it out.” “No,” said Robert, remembering how impossible the Queen of Babylon had found it to get anything out of the glass cases in the Museum—except by Psammead magic, and then she hadn’t been able to take anything away with her; “no—but we remember where we got it, and we can—” “Oh,  do  we?” interrupted Cyril bitterly, “do  you  remember where we got it?” “No,” said Robert, “I don’t exactly, now I come to think of it.” Nor did any of the others! “But  why  can’t we?” said Jane. “Oh,  I  don’t know,” Cyril’s tone was impatient, “some silly old enchanted rule I suppose. I wish people would teach you magic at school like they do sums—or instead of. It would be some use having an Amulet then.” “I wonder how far we are in the future,” said Anthea; the Museum looks just the same, only lighter and brighter, somehow.” “Let’s go back and try the Past again,” said Robert. “Perhaps the Museum people could tell us how we got it,” said Anthea with sudden hope. There was no one in the room, but in the next gallery, where the Assyrian things are and still were, they found a kind, stout man in a loose, blue gown, and stockinged legs. “Oh, they’ve got a new uniform, how pretty!” said Jane. When they asked him their question he showed them a label on the case. It said, “From the collection of—.” A name followed, and it was the name of the learned gentleman who, among themselves, and to his face when he had been with them at the other side of the Amulet, they had called Jimmy. “ That’s  not much good,” said Cyril, “thank you.” “How is it you’re not at school?” asked the kind man in blue. “Not expelled for long I hope?” “We’re not expelled at all,” said Cyril rather warmly. “Well, I shouldn’t do it again, if I were you,” said the man, and they could see he did not believe them. There is no company so little pleasing as that of people who do not believe you. “Thank you for showing us the label,” said Cyril. And they came away. As they came through the doors of the Museum they blinked at the sudden glory of sunlight and blue sky. The houses opposite the Museum were gone. Instead there was a big garden, with trees and flowers and smooth green lawns, and not a single notice to tell you not to walk on the grass and not to destroy the trees and shrubs and not to pick the flowers. There were comfortable seats all about, and arbours covered with roses, and long, trellised walks, also rose-covered. Whispering, splashing fountains fell into full white marble basins, white statues gleamed among the leaves, and the pigeons that swept about among the branches or pecked on the smooth, soft gravel were not black and tumbled like the Museum pigeons are now, but bright and clean and sleek as birds of new silver. A good many people were sitting on the seats, and on the grass babies were rolling and kicking and playing—with very little on indeed. Men, as well as women, seemed to be in charge of the babies and were playing with them. “It’s like a lovely picture,” said Anthea, and it was. For the people’s clothes were of bright, soft colours and all beautifully and very simply made. No one seemed to have any hats or bonnets, but there were a great many Japanese-looking sunshades. And among the trees were hung lamps of coloured glass. “I expect they light those in the evening,” said Jane. “I  do  wish we lived in the future!” They walked down the path, and as they went the people on the benches looked at the four children very curiously, but not rudely or unkindly. The children, in their turn, looked—I hope they did not stare—at the faces of these people in the beautiful soft clothes. Those faces were worth looking at. Not that they were all handsome, though even in the matter of handsomeness they had the advantage of any set of people the children had ever seen. But it was the expression of their faces that made them worth looking at. The children could not tell at first what it was. “I know,” said Anthea suddenly. “They’re not worried; that’s what it is.” And it was. Everybody looked calm, no one seemed to be in a hurry, no one seemed to be anxious, or fretted, and though some did seem to be sad, not a single one looked worried. But though the people looked kind everyone looked so interested in the children that they began to feel a little shy and turned out of the big main path into a narrow little one that wound among trees and shrubs and mossy, dripping springs. It was here, in a deep, shadowed cleft between tall cypresses, that they found the expelled little boy. He was lying face downward on the mossy turf, and the peculiar shaking of his shoulders was a thing they had seen, more than once, in each other. So Anthea kneeled down by him and said— “What’s the matter?” “I’m expelled from school,” said the boy between his sobs. This was serious. People are not expelled for light offences. “Do you mind telling us what you’d done?” “I—I tore up a sheet of paper and threw it about in the playground,” said the child, in the tone of one confessing an unutterable baseness. “You won’t talk to me any more now you know that,” he added without looking up. “Was that all?” asked Anthea. “It’s about enough,” said the child; “and I’m expelled for the whole day!” “I don’t quite understand,” said Anthea, gently. The boy lifted his face, rolled over, and sat up. “Why, whoever on earth are you?” he said. “We’re strangers from a far country,” said Anthea. “In our country it’s not a crime to leave a bit of paper about.” “It is here,” said the child. “If grown-ups do it they’re fined. When we do it we’re expelled for the whole day.” “Well, but,” said Robert, “that just means a day’s holiday.” “You  must  come from a long way off,” said the little boy. “A holiday’s when you all have play and treats and jolliness, all of you together. On your expelled days no one’ll speak to you. Everyone sees you’re an Expelleder or you’d be in school.” “Suppose you were ill?” “Nobody is—hardly. If they are, of course they wear the badge, and everyone is kind to you. I know a boy that stole his sister’s illness badge and wore it when he was expelled for a day.  He  got expelled for a week for that. It must be awful not to go to school for a week.” “Do you  like  school, then?” asked Robert incredulously. “Of course I do. It’s the loveliest place there is. I chose railways for my special subject this year, there are such splendid models and things, and now I shall be all behind because of that torn-up paper.” “You choose your own subject?” asked Cyril. “Yes, of course. Where  did  you come from? Don’t you know  anything? ” “No,” said Jane definitely; “so you’d better tell us.” “Well, on Midsummer Day school breaks up and everything’s decorated with flowers, and you choose your special subject for next year. Of course you have to stick to it for a year at least. Then there are all your other subjects, of course, reading, and painting, and the rules of Citizenship.” “Good gracious!” said Anthea. “Look here,” said the child, jumping up, “it’s nearly four. The expelledness only lasts till then. Come home with me. Mother will tell you all about everything.” “Will your mother like you taking home strange children?” asked Anthea. “I don’t understand,” said the child, settling his leather belt over his honey-coloured smock and stepping out with hard little bare feet. “Come on.” So they went. The streets were wide and hard and very clean. There were no horses, but a sort of motor carriage that made no noise. The Thames flowed between green banks, and there were trees at the edge, and people sat under them, fishing, for the stream was clear as crystal. Everywhere there were green trees and there was no smoke. The houses were set in what seemed like one green garden. The little boy brought them to a house, and at the window was a good, bright mother-face. The little boy rushed in, and through the window they could see him hugging his mother, then his eager lips moving and his quick hands pointing. A lady in soft green clothes came out, spoke kindly to them, and took them into the oddest house they had ever seen. It was very bare, there were no ornaments, and yet every single thing was beautiful, from the dresser with its rows of bright china, to the thick squares of Eastern-looking carpet on the floors. I can’t describe that house; I haven’t the time. And I haven’t heart either, when I think how different it was from our houses. The lady took them all over it. The oddest thing of all was the big room in the middle. It had padded walls and a soft, thick carpet, and all the chairs and tables were padded. There wasn’t a single thing in it that anyone could hurt itself with. “What ever’s this for?—lunatics?” asked Cyril. The lady looked very shocked. “No! It’s for the children, of course,” she said. “Don’t tell me that in your country there are no children’s rooms.” “There are nurseries,” said Anthea doubtfully, “but the furniture’s all cornery and hard, like other rooms.” “How shocking!” said the lady; “you must be  very  much behind the times in your country! Why, the children are more than half of the people; it’s not much to have one room where they can have a good time and not hurt themselves.” “But there’s no fireplace,” said Anthea. “Hot-air pipes, of course,” said the lady. “Why, how could you have a fire in a nursery? A child might get burned.” “In our country,” said Robert suddenly, “more than 3,000 children are burned to death every year. Father told me,” he added, as if apologizing for this piece of information, “once when I’d been playing with fire.” The lady turned quite pale. “What a frightful place you must live in!” she said. “What’s all the furniture padded for?” Anthea asked, hastily turning the subject. “Why, you couldn’t have little tots of two or three running about in rooms where the things were hard and sharp! They might hurt themselves.” Robert fingered the scar on his forehead where he had hit it against the nursery fender when he was little. “But does everyone have rooms like this, poor people and all?” asked Anthea. “There’s a room like this wherever there’s a child, of course,” said the lady. “How refreshingly ignorant you are!—no, I don’t mean ignorant, my dear. Of course, you’re awfully well up in ancient History. But I see you haven’t done your Duties of Citizenship Course yet.” “But beggars, and people like that?” persisted Anthea “and tramps and people who haven’t any homes?” “People who haven’t any homes?” repeated the lady. “I really  don’t  understand what you’re talking about.” “It’s all different in our country,” said Cyril carefully; and I have read it used to be different in London. Usedn’t people to have no homes and beg because they were hungry? And wasn’t London very black and dirty once upon a time? And the Thames all muddy and filthy? And narrow streets, and—” “You must have been reading very old-fashioned books,” said the lady. “Why, all that was in the dark ages! My husband can tell you more about it than I can. He took Ancient History as one of his special subjects.” “I haven’t seen any working people,” said Anthea. “Why, we’re all working people,” said the lady; “at least my husband’s a carpenter.” “Good gracious!” said Anthea; “but you’re a lady!” “Ah,” said the lady, “that quaint old word! Well, my husband  will  enjoy a talk with you. In the dark ages everyone was allowed to have a smoky chimney, and those nasty horses all over the streets, and all sorts of rubbish thrown into the Thames. And, of course, the sufferings of the people will hardly bear thinking of. It’s very learned of you to know it all. Did  you  make Ancient History your special subject?” “Not exactly,” said Cyril, rather uneasily. “What is the Duties of Citizenship Course about?” “Don’t you  really  know? Aren’t you pretending—just for fun? Really not? Well, that course teaches you how to be a good citizen, what you must do and what you mayn’t do, so as to do your full share of the work of making your town a beautiful and happy place for people to live in. There’s a quite simple little thing they teach the tiny children. How does it go...? “I must not steal and I must learn, Nothing is mine that I do not earn. I must try in work and play To make things beautiful every day. I must be kind to everyone, And never let cruel things be done. I must be brave, and I must try When I am hurt never to cry, And always laugh as much as I can, And be glad that I’m going to be a man To work for my living and help the rest And never do less than my very best.” “That’s very easy,” said Jane. “ I  could remember that.” “That’s only the very beginning, of course,” said the lady; “there are heaps more rhymes. There’s the one beginning— “I must not litter the beautiful street With bits of paper or things to eat; I must not pick the public flowers, They are not  mine , but they are  ours .” “And ‘things to eat’ reminds me—are you hungry? Wells, run and get a tray of nice things.” “Why do you call him ‘Wells’?” asked Robert, as the boy ran off. “It’s after the great reformer—surely you’ve heard of  him?  He lived in the dark ages, and he saw that what you ought to do is to find out what you want and then try to get it. Up to then people had always tried to tinker up what they’d got. We’ve got a great many of the things he thought of. Then ‘Wells’ means springs of clear water. It’s a nice name, don’t you think?” Here Wells returned with strawberries and cakes and lemonade on a tray, and everybody ate and enjoyed. “Now, Wells,” said the lady, “run off or you’ll be late and not meet your Daddy.” Wells kissed her, waved to the others, and went. “Look here,” said Anthea suddenly, “would you like to come to  our  country, and see what it’s like? It wouldn’t take you a minute.” The lady laughed. But Jane held up the charm and said the word. “What a splendid conjuring trick!” cried the lady, enchanted with the beautiful, growing arch. “Go through,” said Anthea. The lady went, laughing. But she did not laugh when she found herself, suddenly, in the dining-room at Fitzroy Street. “Oh, what a  horrible  trick!” she cried. “What a hateful, dark, ugly place!” She ran to the window and looked out. The sky was grey, the street was foggy, a dismal organ-grinder was standing opposite the door, a beggar and a man who sold matches were quarrelling at the edge of the pavement on whose greasy black surface people hurried along, hastening to get to the shelter of their houses. “Oh, look at their faces, their horrible faces!” she cried. “What’s the matter with them all?” “They’re poor people, that’s all,” said Robert. “But it’s  not  all! They’re ill, they’re unhappy, they’re wicked! Oh, do stop it, there’s dear children. It’s very, very clever. Some sort of magic-lantern trick, I suppose, like I’ve read of. But  do  stop it. Oh! their poor, tired, miserable, wicked faces!” The tears were in her eyes. Anthea signed to Jane. The arch grew, they spoke the words, and pushed the lady through it into her own time and place, where London is clean and beautiful, and the Thames runs clear and bright, and the green trees grow, and no one is afraid, or anxious, or in a hurry. There was a silence. Then— “I’m glad we went,” said Anthea, with a deep breath. “I’ll never throw paper about again as long as I live,” said Robert. “Mother always told us not to,” said Jane. “I would like to take up the Duties of Citizenship for a special subject,” said Cyril. “I wonder if Father could put me through it. I shall ask him when he comes home.” “If we’d found the Amulet, Father could be home  now ,” said Anthea, “and Mother and The Lamb.” “Let’s go into the future  again ,” suggested Jane brightly. “Perhaps we could remember if it wasn’t such an awful way off.” So they did. This time they said, “The future, where the Amulet is, not so far away.” And they went through the familiar arch into a large, light room with three windows. Facing them was the familiar mummy-case. And at a table by the window sat the learned gentleman. They knew him at once, though his hair was white. He was one of the faces that do not change with age. In his hand was the Amulet—complete and perfect. He rubbed his other hand across his forehead in the way they were so used to. “Dreams, dreams!” he said; “old age is full of them!” “You’ve been in dreams with us before now,” said Robert, “don’t you remember?” “I do, indeed,” said he. The room had many more books than the Fitzroy Street room, and far more curious and wonderful Assyrian and Egyptian objects. “The most wonderful dreams I ever had had you in them.” “Where,” asked Cyril, “did you get that thing in your hand?” “If you weren’t just a dream,” he answered, smiling, you’d remember that you gave it to me.” “But where did we get it?” Cyril asked eagerly. “Ah, you never would tell me that,” he said, “You always had your little mysteries. You dear children! What a difference you made to that old Bloomsbury house! I wish I could dream you oftener. Now you’re grown up you’re not like you used to be.” “Grown up?” said Anthea. The learned gentleman pointed to a frame with four photographs in it. “There you are,” he said. The children saw four grown-up people’s portraits—two ladies, two gentlemen—and looked on them with loathing. “Shall we grow up like  that? ” whispered Jane. “How perfectly horrid!” “If we’re ever like that, we sha’nn’t know it’s horrid, I expect,” Anthea with some insight whispered back. “You see, you get used to yourself while you’re changing. It’s—it’s being so sudden makes it seem so frightful now.” The learned gentleman was looking at them with wistful kindness. “Don’t let me undream you just yet,” he said. There was a pause. “Do you remember  when  we gave you that Amulet?” Cyril asked suddenly. “You know, or you would if you weren’t a dream, that it was on the 3rd December, 1905. I shall never forget  that  day.” “Thank you,” said Cyril, earnestly; “oh, thank you very much.” “You’ve got a new room,” said Anthea, looking out of the window, “and what a lovely garden!” “Yes,” said he, “I’m too old now to care even about being near the Museum. This is a beautiful place. Do you know—I can hardly believe you’re just a dream, you do look so exactly real. Do you know...” his voice dropped, “I can say it to  you , though, of course, if I said it to anyone that wasn’t a dream they’d call me mad; there was something about that Amulet you gave me—something very mysterious.” “There was that,” said Robert. “Ah, I don’t mean your pretty little childish mysteries about where you got it. But about the thing itself. First, the wonderful dreams I used to have, after you’d shown me the first half of it! Why, my book on Atlantis, that I did, was the beginning of my fame and my fortune, too. And I got it all out of a dream! And then, ‘Britain at the Time of the Roman Invasion’—that was only a pamphlet, but it explained a lot of things people hadn’t understood.” “Yes,” said Anthea, “it would.” “That was the beginning. But after you’d given me the whole of the Amulet—ah, it was generous of you!—then, somehow, I didn’t need to theorize, I seemed to  know  about the old Egyptian civilization. And they can’t upset my theories”—he rubbed his thin hands and laughed triumphantly—“they can’t, though they’ve tried. Theories, they call them, but they’re more like—I don’t know—more like memories. I  know  I’m right about the secret rites of the Temple of Amen.” “I’m so glad you’re rich,” said Anthea. “You weren’t, you know, at Fitzroy Street.” “Indeed I wasn’t,” said he, “but I am now. This beautiful house and this lovely garden—I dig in it sometimes; you remember, you used to tell me to take more exercise? Well, I feel I owe it all to you—and the Amulet.” “I’m so glad,” said Anthea, and kissed him. He started. “ That  didn’t feel like a dream,” he said, and his voice trembled. “It isn’t exactly a dream,” said Anthea softly, “it’s all part of the Amulet—it’s a sort of extra special, real dream, dear Jimmy.” “Ah,” said he, “when you call me that, I know I’m dreaming. My little sister—I dream of her sometimes. But it’s not real like this. Do you remember the day I dreamed you brought me the Babylonish ring?” “We remember it all,” said Robert. “Did you leave Fitzroy Street because you were too rich for it?” “Oh, no!” he said reproachfully. “You know I should never have done such a thing as that. Of course, I left when your old Nurse died and—what’s the matter!” “Old Nurse  dead? ” said Anthea. “Oh,  no! ” “Yes, yes, it’s the common lot. It’s a long time ago now.” Jane held up the Amulet in a hand that twittered. “Come!” she cried, “oh, come home! She may be dead before we get there, and then we can’t give it to her. Oh, come!” “Ah, don’t let the dream end now!” pleaded the learned gentleman. “It must,” said Anthea firmly, and kissed him again. “When it comes to people dying,” said Robert, “good-bye! I’m so glad you’re rich and famous and happy.” “ Do  come!” cried Jane, stamping in her agony of impatience. And they went. Old Nurse brought in tea almost as soon as they were back in Fitzroy Street. As she came in with the tray, the girls rushed at her and nearly upset her and it. “Don’t die!” cried Jane, “oh, don’t!” and Anthea cried, “Dear, ducky, darling old Nurse, don’t die!” “Lord, love you!” said Nurse, “I’m not agoin’ to die yet a while, please Heaven! Whatever on earth’s the matter with the chicks?” “Nothing. Only don’t!” She put the tray down and hugged the girls in turn. The boys thumped her on the back with heartfelt affection. “I’m as well as ever I was in my life,” she said. “What nonsense about dying! You’ve been a sitting too long in the dusk, that’s what it is. Regular blind man’s holiday. Leave go of me, while I light the gas.” The yellow light illuminated four pale faces. “We do love you so,” Anthea went on, “and we’ve made you a picture to show you how we love you. Get it out, Squirrel.” The glazed testimonial was dragged out from under the sofa and displayed. “The glue’s not dry yet,” said Cyril, “look out!” “What a beauty!” cried old Nurse. “Well, I never! And your pictures and the beautiful writing and all. Well, I always did say your hearts was in the right place, if a bit careless at times. Well! I never did! I don’t know as I was ever pleased better in my life.” She hugged them all, one after the other. And the boys did not mind it, somehow, that day. “How is it we can remember all about the future,  now? ” Anthea woke the Psammead with laborious gentleness to put the question. “How is it we can remember what we saw in the future, and yet, when we  were  in the future, we could not remember the bit of the future that was past then, the time of finding the Amulet?” “Why, what a silly question!” said the Psammead, “of course you cannot remember what hasn’t happened yet.” “But the  future  hasn’t happened yet,” Anthea persisted, “and we remember that all right.” “Oh, that isn’t what’s happened, my good child,” said the Psammead, rather crossly, “that’s prophetic vision. And you remember dreams, don’t you? So why not visions? You never do seem to understand the simplest thing.” It went to sand again at once. Anthea crept down in her nightgown to give one last kiss to old Nurse, and one last look at the beautiful testimonial hanging, by its tapes, its glue now firmly set, in glazed glory on the wall of the kitchen. “Good-night, bless your loving heart,” said old Nurse, “if only you don’t catch your deather-cold!” CHAPTER XIII. THE SHIPWRECK ON THE TIN ISLANDS “Blue and red,” said Jane softly, “make purple.” “Not always they don’t,” said Cyril, “it has to be crimson lake and Prussian blue. If you mix Vermilion and Indigo you get the most loathsome slate colour.” “Sepia’s the nastiest colour in the box, I think,” said Jane, sucking her brush. They were all painting. Nurse in the flush of grateful emotion, excited by Robert’s border of poppies, had presented each of the four with a shilling paint-box, and had supplemented the gift with a pile of old copies of the  Illustrated London News . “Sepia,” said Cyril instructively, “is made out of beastly cuttlefish.” “Purple’s made out of a fish, as well as out of red and blue,” said Robert. “Tyrian purple was, I know.” “Out of lobsters?” said Jane dreamily. “They’re red when they’re boiled, and blue when they aren’t. If you mixed live and dead lobsters you’d get Tyrian purple.” “ I  shouldn’t like to mix anything with a live lobster,” said Anthea, shuddering. “Well, there aren’t any other red and blue fish,” said Jane; “you’d have to.” “I’d rather not have the purple,” said Anthea. “The Tyrian purple wasn’t that colour when it came out of the fish, nor yet afterwards, it wasn’t,” said Robert; “it was scarlet really, and Roman Emperors wore it. And it wasn’t any nice colour while the fish had it. It was a yellowish-white liquid of a creamy consistency.” “How do you know?” asked Cyril. “I read it,” said Robert, with the meek pride of superior knowledge. “Where?” asked Cyril. “In print,” said Robert, still more proudly meek. “You think everything’s true if it’s printed,” said Cyril, naturally annoyed, “but it isn’t. Father said so. Quite a lot of lies get printed, especially in newspapers.” “You see, as it happens,” said Robert, in what was really a rather annoying tone, “it wasn’t a newspaper, it was in a book.” “How sweet Chinese white is!” said Jane, dreamily sucking her brush again. “I don’t believe it,” said Cyril to Robert. “Have a suck yourself,” suggested Robert. “I don’t mean about the Chinese white. I mean about the cream fish turning purple and—” “Oh!” cried Anthea, jumping up very quickly, “I’m tired of painting. Let’s go somewhere by Amulet. I say let’s let  it  choose.” Cyril and Robert agreed that this was an idea. Jane consented to stop painting because, as she said, Chinese white, though certainly sweet, gives you a queer feeling in the back of the throat if you paint with it too long. The Amulet was held up. “Take us somewhere,” said Jane, “anywhere you like in the Past—but somewhere where you are.” Then she said the word. Next moment everyone felt a queer rocking and swaying—something like what you feel when you go out in a fishing boat. And that was not wonderful, when you come to think of it, for it was in a boat that they found themselves. A queer boat, with high bulwarks pierced with holes for oars to go through. There was a high seat for the steersman, and the prow was shaped like the head of some great animal with big, staring eyes. The boat rode at anchor in a bay, and the bay was very smooth. The crew were dark, wiry fellows with black beards and hair. They had no clothes except a tunic from waist to knee, and round caps with knobs on the top. They were very busy, and what they were doing was so interesting to the children that at first they did not even wonder where the Amulet had brought them. And the crew seemed too busy to notice the children. They were fastening rush baskets to a long rope with a great piece of cork at the end, and in each basket they put mussels or little frogs. Then they cast out the rope, the baskets sank, but the cork floated. And all about on the blue water were other boats and all the crews of all the boats were busy with ropes and baskets and frogs and mussels. “Whatever are you doing?” Jane suddenly asked a man who had rather more clothes than the others, and seemed to be a sort of captain or overseer. He started and stared at her, but he had seen too many strange lands to be very much surprised at these queerly-dressed stowaways. “Setting lines for the dye shell-fish,” he said shortly. “How did you get here?” “A sort of magic,” said Robert carelessly. The Captain fingered an Amulet that hung round his neck. “What is this place?” asked Cyril. “Tyre, of course,” said the man. Then he drew back and spoke in a low voice to one of the sailors. “Now we shall know about your precious cream-jug fish,” said Cyril. “But we never  said  come to Tyre,” said Jane. “The Amulet heard us talking, I expect. I think it’s  most  obliging of it,” said Anthea. “And the Amulet’s here too,” said Robert. “We ought to be able to find it in a little ship like this. I wonder which of them’s got it.” “Oh—look, look!” cried Anthea suddenly. On the bare breast of one of the sailors gleamed something red. It was the exact counterpart of their precious half-Amulet. A silence, full of emotion, was broken by Jane. “Then we’ve found it!” she said. “Oh do let’s take it and go home!” “Easy to say ‘take it’,” said Cyril; “he looks very strong.” He did—yet not so strong as the other sailors. “It’s odd,” said Anthea musingly, “I do believe I’ve seen that man somewhere before.” “He’s rather like our learned gentleman,” said Robert, “but I’ll tell you who he’s much more like—” At this moment that sailor looked up. His eyes met Robert’s—and Robert and the others had no longer any doubt as to where they had seen him before. It was Rekh-marā, the priest who had led them to the palace of Pharaoh—and whom Jane had looked back at through the arch, when he was counselling Pharaoh’s guard to take the jewels and fly for his life. Nobody was quite pleased, and nobody quite knew why. Jane voiced the feelings of all when she said, fingering  their  Amulet through the folds of her frock, “We can go back in a minute if anything nasty happens.” For the moment nothing worse happened than an offer of food—figs and cucumbers it was, and very pleasant. “I see,” said the Captain, “that you are from a far country. Since you have honoured my boat by appearing on it, you must stay here till morning. Then I will lead you to one of our great ones. He loves strangers from far lands.” “Let’s go home,” Jane whispered, “all the frogs are drowning  now . I think the people here are cruel.” But the boys wanted to stay and see the lines taken up in the morning. “It’s just like eel-pots and lobster-pots,” said Cyril, “the baskets only open from outside—I vote we stay.” So they stayed. “That’s Tyre over there,” said the Captain, who was evidently trying to be civil. He pointed to a great island rock, that rose steeply from the sea, crowned with huge walls and towers. There was another city on the mainland. “That’s part of Tyre, too,” said the Captain; “it’s where the great merchants have their pleasure-houses and gardens and farms.” “Look, look!” Cyril cried suddenly; “what a lovely little ship!” A ship in full sail was passing swiftly through the fishing fleet. The Captain’s face changed. He frowned, and his eyes blazed with fury. “Insolent young barbarian!” he cried. “Do you call the ships of Tyre  little?  None greater sail the seas. That ship has been on a three years’ voyage. She is known in all the great trading ports from here to the Tin Islands. She comes back rich and glorious. Her very anchor is of silver.” “I’m sure we beg your pardon,” said Anthea hastily. “In our country we say ‘little’ for a pet name. Your wife might call you her dear little husband, you know.” “I should like to catch her at it,” growled the Captain, but he stopped scowling. “It’s a rich trade,” he went on. “For cloth  once  dipped, second-best glass, and the rough images our young artists carve for practice, the barbarian King in Tessos lets us work the silver mines. We get so much silver there that we leave them our iron anchors and come back with silver ones.” “How splendid!” said Robert. “Do go on. What’s cloth once dipped?” “You  must  be barbarians from the outer darkness,” said the Captain scornfully. “All wealthy nations know that our finest stuffs are twice dyed—dibaptha. They’re only for the robes of kings and priests and princes.” “What do the rich merchants wear,” asked Jane, with interest, “in the pleasure-houses?” “They wear the dibaptha.  Our  merchants  are  princes,” scowled the skipper. “Oh, don’t be cross, we do so like hearing about things. We want to know  all  about the dyeing,” said Anthea cordially. “Oh, you do, do you?” growled the man. “So that’s what you’re here for? Well, you won’t get the secrets of the dye trade out of  me .” He went away, and everyone felt snubbed and uncomfortable. And all the time the long, narrow eyes of the Egyptian were watching, watching. They felt as though he was watching them through the darkness, when they lay down to sleep on a pile of cloaks. Next morning the baskets were drawn up full of what looked like whelk shells. The children were rather in the way, but they made themselves as small as they could. While the skipper was at the other end of the boat they did ask one question of a sailor, whose face was a little less unkind than the others. “Yes,” he answered, “this is the dye-fish. It’s a sort of murex—and there’s another kind that they catch at Sidon and then, of course, there’s the kind that’s used for the dibaptha. But that’s quite different. It’s—” “Hold your tongue!” shouted the skipper. And the man held it. The laden boat was rowed slowly round the end of the island, and was made fast in one of the two great harbours that lay inside a long breakwater. The harbour was full of all sorts of ships, so that Cyril and Robert enjoyed themselves much more than their sisters. The breakwater and the quays were heaped with bales and baskets, and crowded with slaves and sailors. Farther along some men were practising diving. “That’s jolly good,” said Robert, as a naked brown body cleft the water. “I should think so,” said the skipper. “The pearl-divers of Persia are not more skilful. Why, we’ve got a fresh-water spring that comes out at the bottom of the sea. Our divers dive down and bring up the fresh water in skin bottles! Can your barbarian divers do as much?” “I suppose not,” said Robert, and put away a wild desire to explain to the Captain the English system of waterworks, pipes, taps, and the intricacies of the plumbers’ trade. As they neared the quay the skipper made a hasty toilet. He did his hair, combed his beard, put on a garment like a jersey with short sleeves, an embroidered belt, a necklace of beads, and a big signet ring. “Now,” said he, “I’m fit to be seen. Come along?” “Where to?” said Jane cautiously. “To Pheles, the great sea-captain, said the skipper, “the man I told you of, who loves barbarians.” Then Rekh-marā came forward, and, for the first time, spoke. “I have known these children in another land,” he said. “You know my powers of magic. It was my magic that brought these barbarians to your boat. And you know how they will profit you. I read your thoughts. Let me come with you and see the end of them, and then I will work the spell I promised you in return for the little experience you have so kindly given me on your boat.” The skipper looked at the Egyptian with some disfavour. “So it was  your  doing,” he said. “I might have guessed it. Well, come on.” So he came, and the girls wished he hadn’t. But Robert whispered— “Nonsense—as long as he’s with us we’ve got  some  chance of the Amulet. We can always fly if anything goes wrong.” The morning was so fresh and bright; their breakfast had been so good and so unusual; they had actually seen the Amulet round the Egyptian’s neck. One or two, or all these things, suddenly raised the children’s spirits. They went off quite cheerfully through the city gate—it was not arched, but roofed over with a great flat stone—and so through the street, which smelt horribly of fish and garlic and a thousand other things even less agreeable. But far worse than the street scents was the scent of the factory, where the skipper called in to sell his night’s catch. I wish I could tell you all about that factory, but I haven’t time, and perhaps after all you aren’t interested in dyeing works. I will only mention that Robert was triumphantly proved to be right. The dye  was  a yellowish-white liquid of a creamy consistency, and it smelt more strongly of garlic than garlic itself does. While the skipper was bargaining with the master of the dye works the Egyptian came close to the children, and said, suddenly and softly— “Trust me.” “I wish we could,” said Anthea. “You feel,” said the Egyptian, “that I want your Amulet. That makes you distrust me.” “Yes,” said Cyril bluntly. “But you also, you want my Amulet, and I am trusting you.” “There’s something in that,” said Robert. “We have the two halves of the Amulet,” said the Priest, “but not yet the pin that joined them. Our only chance of getting that is to remain together. Once part these two halves and they may never be found in the same time and place. Be wise. Our interests are the same.” Before anyone could say more the skipper came back, and with him the dye-master. His hair and beard were curled like the men’s in Babylon, and he was dressed like the skipper, but with added grandeur of gold and embroidery. He had necklaces of beads and silver, and a glass amulet with a man’s face, very like his own, set between two bull’s heads, as well as gold and silver bracelets and armlets. He looked keenly at the children. Then he said— “My brother Pheles has just come back from Tarshish. He’s at his garden house—unless he’s hunting wild boar in the marshes. He gets frightfully bored on shore.” “Ah,” said the skipper, “he’s a true-born Phoenician. ‘Tyre, Tyre for ever! Oh, Tyre rules the waves!’ as the old song says. I’ll go at once, and show him my young barbarians.” “I should,” said the dye-master. “They are very rum, aren’t they? What frightful clothes, and what a lot of them! Observe the covering of their feet. Hideous indeed.” Robert could not help thinking how easy, and at the same time pleasant, it would be to catch hold of the dye-master’s feet and tip him backward into the great sunken vat just near him. But if he had, flight would have had to be the next move, so he restrained his impulse. There was something about this Tyrian adventure that was different from all the others. It was, somehow, calmer. And there was the undoubted fact that the charm was there on the neck of the Egyptian. So they enjoyed everything to the full, the row from the Island City to the shore, the ride on the donkeys that the skipper hired at the gate of the mainland city, and the pleasant country—palms and figs and cedars all about. It was like a garden—clematis, honeysuckle, and jasmine clung about the olive and mulberry trees, and there were tulips and gladiolus, and clumps of mandrake, which has bell-flowers that look as though they were cut out of dark blue jewels. In the distance were the mountains of Lebanon. The house they came to at last was rather like a bungalow—long and low, with pillars all along the front. Cedars and sycamores grew near it and sheltered it pleasantly. Everyone dismounted, and the donkeys were led away. “Why is this like Rosherville?” whispered Robert, and instantly supplied the answer. “Because it’s the place to spend a happy day.” “It’s jolly decent of the skipper to have brought us to such a ripping place,” said Cyril. “Do you know,” said Anthea, “this feels more real than anything else we’ve seen? It’s like a holiday in the country at home.” The children were left alone in a large hall. The floor was mosaic, done with wonderful pictures of ships and sea-beasts and fishes. Through an open doorway they could see a pleasant courtyard with flowers. “I should like to spend a week here,” said Jane, “and donkey ride every day.” Everyone was feeling very jolly. Even the Egyptian looked pleasanter than usual. And then, quite suddenly, the skipper came back with a joyous smile. With him came the master of the house. He looked steadily at the children and nodded twice. “Yes,” he said, “my steward will pay you the price. But I shall not pay at that high rate for the Egyptian dog.” The two passed on. “This,” said the Egyptian, “is a pretty kettle of fish.” “What is?” asked all the children at once. “Our present position,” said Rekh-marā. “Our seafaring friend,” he added, “has sold us all for slaves!” A hasty council succeeded the shock of this announcement. The Priest was allowed to take part in it. His advice was “stay”, because they were in no danger, and the Amulet in its completeness must be somewhere near, or, of course, they could not have come to that place at all. And after some discussion they agreed to this. The children were treated more as guests than as slaves, but the Egyptian was sent to the kitchen and made to work. Pheles, the master of the house, went off that very evening, by the King’s orders, to start on another voyage. And when he was gone his wife found the children amusing company, and kept them talking and singing and dancing till quite late. “To distract my mind from my sorrows,” she said. “I do like being a slave,” remarked Jane cheerfully, as they curled up on the big, soft cushions that were to be their beds. It was black night when they were awakened, each by a hand passed softly over its face, and a low voice that whispered— “Be quiet, or all is lost.” So they were quiet. “It’s me, Rekh-marā, the Priest of Amen,” said the whisperer. “The man who brought us has gone to sea again, and he has taken my Amulet from me by force, and I know no magic to get it back. Is there magic for that in the Amulet you bear?” Everyone was instantly awake by now. “We can go after him,” said Cyril, leaping up; “but he might take  ours  as well; or he might be angry with us for following him.” “I’ll see to  that ,” said the Egyptian in the dark. “Hide your Amulet well.” There in the deep blackness of that room in the Tyrian country house the Amulet was once more held up and the word spoken. All passed through on to a ship that tossed and tumbled on a wind-blown sea. They crouched together there till morning, and Jane and Cyril were not at all well. When the dawn showed, dove-coloured, across the steely waves, they stood up as well as they could for the tumbling of the ship. Pheles, that hardy sailor and adventurer, turned quite pale when he turned round suddenly and saw them. “Well!” he said, “well, I never did!” “Master,” said the Egyptian, bowing low, and that was even more difficult than standing up, “we are here by the magic of the sacred Amulet that hangs round your neck.” “I never did!” repeated Pheles. “Well, well!” “What port is the ship bound for?” asked Robert, with a nautical air. But Pheles said, “Are you a navigator?” Robert had to own that he was not. “Then,” said Pheles, “I don’t mind telling you that we’re bound for the Tin Isles. Tyre alone knows where the Tin Isles are. It is a splendid secret we keep from all the world. It is as great a thing to us as your magic to you.” He spoke in quite a new voice, and seemed to respect both the children and the Amulet a good deal more than he had done before. “The King sent you, didn’t he?” said Jane. “Yes,” answered Pheles, “he bade me set sail with half a score brave gentlemen and this crew. You shall go with us, and see many wonders.” He bowed and left them. “What are we going to do now?” said Robert, when Pheles had caused them to be left along with a breakfast of dried fruits and a sort of hard biscuit. “Wait till he lands in the Tin Isles,” said Rekh-marā, “then we can get the barbarians to help us. We will attack him by night and tear the sacred Amulet from his accursed heathen neck,” he added, grinding his teeth. “When shall we get to the Tin Isles?” asked Jane. “Oh—six months, perhaps, or a year,” said the Egyptian cheerfully. “A  year  of this?” cried Jane, and Cyril, who was still feeling far too unwell to care about breakfast, hugged himself miserably and shuddered. It was Robert who said— “Look here, we can shorten that year. Jane, out with the Amulet! Wish that we were where the Amulet will be when the ship is twenty miles from the Tin Island. That’ll give us time to mature our plans.” It was done—the work of a moment—and there they were on the same ship, between grey northern sky and grey northern sea. The sun was setting in a pale yellow line. It was the same ship, but it was changed, and so were the crew. Weather-worn and dirty were the sailors, and their clothes torn and ragged. And the children saw that, of course, though they had skipped the nine months, the ship had had to live through them. Pheles looked thinner, and his face was rugged and anxious. “Ha!” he cried, “the charm has brought you back! I have prayed to it daily these nine months—and now you are here? Have you no magic that can help?” “What is your need?” asked the Egyptian quietly. “I need a great wave that shall whelm away the foreign ship that follows us. A month ago it lay in wait for us, by the pillars of the gods, and it follows, follows, to find out the secret of Tyre—the place of the Tin Islands. If I could steer by night I could escape them yet, but tonight there will be no stars.” “My magic will not serve you here,” said the Egyptian. But Robert said, “My magic will not bring up great waves, but I can show you how to steer without stars.” He took out the shilling compass, still, fortunately, in working order, that he had bought off another boy at school for fivepence, a piece of indiarubber, a strip of whalebone, and half a stick of red sealing-wax. And he showed Pheles how it worked. And Pheles wondered at the compass’s magic truth. “I will give it to you,” Robert said, “in return for that charm about your neck.” Pheles made no answer. He first laughed, snatched the compass from Robert’s hand, and turned away still laughing. “Be comforted,” the Priest whispered, “our time will come.” The dusk deepened, and Pheles, crouched beside a dim lantern, steered by the shilling compass from the Crystal Palace. No one ever knew how the other ship sailed, but suddenly, in the deep night, the look-out man at the stern cried out in a terrible voice— “She is close upon us!” “And we,” said Pheles, “are close to the harbour.” He was silent a moment, then suddenly he altered the ship’s course, and then he stood up and spoke. “Good friends and gentlemen,” he said, “who are bound with me in this brave venture by our King’s command, the false, foreign ship is close on our heels. If we land, they land, and only the gods know whether they might not beat us in fight, and themselves survive to carry back the tale of Tyre’s secret island to enrich their own miserable land. Shall this be?” “Never!” cried the half-dozen men near him. The slaves were rowing hard below and could not hear his words. The Egyptian leaped upon him; suddenly, fiercely, as a wild beast leaps. “Give me back my Amulet,” he cried, and caught at the charm. The chain that held it snapped, and it lay in the Priest’s hand. Pheles laughed, standing balanced to the leap of the ship that answered the oarstroke. “This is no time for charms and mummeries,” he said. “We’ve lived like men, and we’ll die like gentlemen for the honour and glory of Tyre, our splendid city. ‘Tyre, Tyre for ever! It’s Tyre that rules the waves.’ I steer her straight for the Dragon rocks, and we go down for our city, as brave men should. The creeping cowards who follow shall go down as slaves—and slaves they shall be to us—when we live again. Tyre, Tyre for ever!” A great shout went up, and the slaves below joined in it. “Quick, the Amulet,” cried Anthea, and held it up. Rekh-marā held up the one he had snatched from Pheles. The word was spoken, and the two great arches grew on the plunging ship in the shrieking wind under the dark sky. From each Amulet a great and beautiful green light streamed and shone far out over the waves. It illuminated, too, the black faces and jagged teeth of the great rocks that lay not two ships’ lengths from the boat’s peaked nose. “Tyre, Tyre for ever! It’s Tyre that rules the waves!” the voices of the doomed rose in a triumphant shout. The children scrambled through the arch, and stood trembling and blinking in the Fitzroy Street parlour, and in their ears still sounded the whistle of the wind, and the rattle of the oars, the crash of the ships bow on the rocks, and the last shout of the brave gentlemen-adventurers who went to their deaths singing, for the sake of the city they loved. “And so we’ve lost the other half of the Amulet again,” said Anthea, when they had told the Psammead all about it. “Nonsense, pooh!” said the Psammead. “That wasn’t the other half. It was the same half that you’ve got—the one that wasn’t crushed and lost.” “But how could it be the same?” said Anthea gently. “Well, not exactly, of course. The one you’ve got is a good many years older, but at any rate it’s not the other one. What did you say when you wished?” “I forget,” said Jane. “I don’t,” said the Psammead. “You said, ‘Take us where  you  are’—and it did, so you see it was the same half.” “I see,” said Anthea. “But you mark my words,” the Psammead went on, “you’ll have trouble with that Priest yet.” “Why, he was quite friendly,” said Anthea. “All the same you’d better beware of the Reverend Rekh-marā.” “Oh, I’m sick of the Amulet,” said Cyril, “we shall never get it.” “Oh yes we shall,” said Robert. “Don’t you remember December 3rd?” “Jinks!” said Cyril, “I’d forgotten that.” “I don’t believe it,” said Jane, “and I don’t feel at all well.” “If I were you,” said the Psammead, “I should not go out into the Past again till that date. You’ll find it safer not to go where you’re likely to meet that Egyptian any more just at present.” “Of course we’ll do as you say,” said Anthea soothingly, “though there’s something about his face that I really do like.” “Still, you don’t want to run after him, I suppose,” snapped the Psammead. “You wait till the 3rd, and then see what happens.” Cyril and Jane were feeling far from well, Anthea was always obliging, so Robert was overruled. And they promised. And none of them, not even the Psammead, at all foresaw, as you no doubt do quite plainly, exactly what it was that  would  happen on that memorable date. CHAPTER XIV. THE HEART’S DESIRE If I only had time I could tell you lots of things. For instance, how, in spite of the advice of the Psammead, the four children did, one very wet day, go through their Amulet Arch into the golden desert, and there find the great Temple of Baalbec and meet with the Phœnix whom they never thought to see again. And how the Phœnix did not remember them at all until it went into a sort of prophetic trance—if that can be called remembering. But, alas! I  haven’t  time, so I must leave all that out though it was a wonderfully thrilling adventure. I must leave out, too, all about the visit of the children to the Hippodrome with the Psammead in its travelling bag, and about how the wishes of the people round about them were granted so suddenly and surprisingly that at last the Psammead had to be taken hurriedly home by Anthea, who consequently missed half the performance. Then there was the time when, Nurse having gone to tea with a friend out Ivalunk way, they were playing “devil in the dark”—and in the midst of that most creepy pastime the postman’s knock frightened Jane nearly out of her life. She took in the letters, however, and put them in the back of the hat-stand drawer, so that they should be safe. And safe they were, for she never thought of them again for weeks and weeks. One really good thing happened when they took the Psammead to a magic-lantern show and lecture at the boys’ school at Camden Town. The lecture was all about our soldiers in South Africa. And the lecturer ended up by saying, “And I hope every boy in this room has in his heart the seeds of courage and heroism and self-sacrifice, and I wish that every one of you may grow up to be noble and brave and unselfish, worthy citizens of this great Empire for whom our soldiers have freely given their lives.” And, of course, this came true—which was a distinct score for Camden Town. As Anthea said, it was unlucky that the lecturer said boys, because now she and Jane would have to be noble and unselfish, if at all, without any outside help. But Jane said, “I daresay we are already because of our beautiful natures. It’s only boys that have to be made brave by magic”—which nearly led to a first-class row. And I daresay you would like to know all about the affair of the fishing rod, and the fish-hooks, and the cook next door—which was amusing from some points of view, though not perhaps the cook’s—but there really is no time even for that. The only thing that there’s time to tell about is the Adventure of Maskelyne and Cooke’s, and the Unexpected Apparition—which is also the beginning of the end. It was Nurse who broke into the gloomy music of the autumn rain on the window panes by suggesting a visit to the Egyptian Hall, England’s Home of Mystery. Though they had good, but private reasons to know that their own particular personal mystery was of a very different brand, the four all brightened at the idea. All children, as well as a good many grown-ups, love conjuring. “It’s in Piccadilly,” said old Nurse, carefully counting out the proper number of shillings into Cyril’s hand, “not so very far down on the left from the Circus. There’s big pillars outside, something like Carter’s seed place in Holborn, as used to be Day and Martin’s blacking when I was a gell. And something like Euston Station, only not so big.” “Yes, I know,” said everybody. So they started. But though they walked along the left-hand side of Piccadilly they saw no pillared building that was at all like Carter’s seed warehouse or Euston Station or England’s Home of Mystery as they remembered it. At last they stopped a hurried lady, and asked her the way to Maskelyne and Cooke’s. “I don’t know, I’m sure,” she said, pushing past them. “I always shop at the Stores.” Which just shows, as Jane said, how ignorant grown-up people are. It was a policeman who at last explained to them that England’s Mysteries are now appropriately enough enacted at St George’s Hall. So they tramped to Langham Place, and missed the first two items in the programme. But they were in time for the most wonderful magic appearances and disappearances, which they could hardly believe—even with all their knowledge of a larger magic—was not really magic after all. “If only the Babylonians could have seen  this  conjuring,” whispered Cyril. “It takes the shine out of their old conjurer, doesn’t it?” “Hush!” said Anthea and several other members of the audience. Now there was a vacant seat next to Robert. And it was when all eyes were fixed on the stage where Mr Devant was pouring out glasses of all sorts of different things to drink, out of one kettle with one spout, and the audience were delightedly tasting them, that Robert felt someone in that vacant seat. He did not feel someone sit down in it. It was just that one moment there was no one sitting there, and the next moment, suddenly, there was someone. Robert turned. The someone who had suddenly filled that empty place was Rekh-marā, the Priest of Amen! Though the eyes of the audience were fixed on Mr David Devant, Mr David Devant’s eyes were fixed on the audience. And it happened that his eyes were more particularly fixed on that empty chair. So that he saw quite plainly the sudden appearance, from nowhere, of the Egyptian Priest. “A jolly good trick,” he said to himself, “and worked under my own eyes, in my own hall. I’ll find out how that’s done.” He had never seen a trick that he could not do himself if he tried. By this time a good many eyes in the audience had turned on the clean-shaven, curiously-dressed figure of the Egyptian Priest. “Ladies and gentlemen,” said Mr Devant, rising to the occasion, “this is a trick I have never before performed. The empty seat, third from the end, second row, gallery—you will now find occupied by an Ancient Egyptian, warranted genuine.” He little knew how true his words were. And now all eyes were turned on the Priest and the children, and the whole audience, after a moment’s breathless surprise, shouted applause. Only the lady on the other side of Rekh-marā drew back a little. She  knew  no one had passed her, and, as she said later, over tea and cold tongue, “it was that sudden it made her flesh creep.” Rekh-marā seemed very much annoyed at the notice he was exciting. “Come out of this crowd,” he whispered to Robert. “I must talk with you apart.” “Oh, no,” Jane whispered. “I did so want to see the Mascot Moth, and the Ventriloquist.” “How did you get here?” was Robert’s return whisper. “How did you get to Egypt and to Tyre?” retorted Rekh-marā. “Come, let us leave this crowd.” “There’s no help for it, I suppose,” Robert shrugged angrily. But they all got up. “Confederates!” said a man in the row behind. “Now they go round to the back and take part in the next scene.” “I wish we did,” said Robert. “Confederate yourself!” said Cyril. And so they got away, the audience applauding to the last. In the vestibule of St George’s Hall they disguised Rekh-marā as well as they could, but even with Robert’s hat and Cyril’s Inverness cape he was too striking a figure for foot-exercise in the London streets. It had to be a cab, and it took the last, least money of all of them. They stopped the cab a few doors from home, and then the girls went in and engaged old Nurse’s attention by an account of the conjuring and a fervent entreaty for dripping-toast with their tea, leaving the front door open so that while Nurse was talking to them the boys could creep quietly in with Rekh-marā and smuggle him, unseen, up the stairs into their bedroom. When the girls came up they found the Egyptian Priest sitting on the side of Cyril’s bed, his hands on his knees, looking like a statue of a king. “Come on,” said Cyril impatiently. “He won’t begin till we’re all here. And shut the door, can’t you?” When the door was shut the Egyptian said— “My interests and yours are one.” “Very interesting,” said Cyril, “and it’ll be a jolly sight more interesting if you keep following us about in a decent country with no more clothes on than  that! ” “Peace,” said the Priest. “What is this country? and what is this  time? ” “The country’s England,” said Anthea, “and the time’s about 6,000 years later than  your  time.” “The Amulet, then,” said the Priest, deeply thoughtful, “gives the power to move to and fro in time as well as in space?” “That’s about it,” said Cyril gruffly. “Look here, it’ll be tea-time directly. What are we to do with you?” “You have one-half of the Amulet, I the other,” said Rekh-marā. “All that is now needed is the pin to join them.” “Don’t you think it,” said Robert. “The half you’ve got is the same half as the one we’ve got.” “But the same thing cannot be in the same place and the same time, and yet be not one, but twain,” said the Priest. “See, here is my half.” He laid it on the Marcella counterpane. “Where is yours?” Jane watching the eyes of the others, unfastened the string of the Amulet and laid it on the bed, but too far off for the Priest to seize it, even if he had been so dishonourable. Cyril and Robert stood beside him, ready to spring on him if one of his hands had moved but ever so little towards the magic treasure that was theirs. But his hands did not move, only his eyes opened very wide, and so did everyone else’s for the Amulet the Priest had now quivered and shook; and then, as steel is drawn to the magnet, it was drawn across the white counterpane, nearer and nearer to the Amulet, warm from the neck of Jane. And then, as one drop of water mingles with another on a rain-wrinkled window-pane, as one bead of quick-silver is drawn into another bead, Rekh-marā’s Amulet slipped into the other one, and, behold! there was no more but the one Amulet! “Black magic!” cried Rekh-marā, and sprang forward to snatch the Amulet that had swallowed his. But Anthea caught it up, and at the same moment the Priest was jerked back by a rope thrown over his head. It drew, tightened with the pull of his forward leap, and bound his elbows to his sides. Before he had time to use his strength to free himself, Robert had knotted the cord behind him and tied it to the bedpost. Then the four children, overcoming the priest’s wrigglings and kickings, tied his legs with more rope. “I thought,” said Robert, breathing hard, and drawing the last knot tight, “he’d have a try for  Ours , so I got the ropes out of the box-room, so as to be ready.” The girls, with rather white faces, applauded his foresight. “Loosen these bonds!” cried Rekh-marā in fury, “before I blast you with the seven secret curses of Amen-Rā!” “We shouldn’t be likely to loose them  after ,” Robert retorted. “Oh, don’t quarrel!” said Anthea desperately. “Look here, he  has  just as much right to the thing as we have. This,” she took up the Amulet that had swallowed the other one, “this has got his in it as well as being ours. Let’s go shares.” “Let me go!” cried the Priest, writhing. “Now, look here,” said Robert, “if you make a row we can just open that window and call the police—the guards, you know—and tell them you’ve been trying to rob us.  Now  will you shut up and listen to reason?” “I suppose so,” said Rekh-marā sulkily. But reason could not be spoken to him till a whispered counsel had been held in the far corner by the washhand-stand and the towel-horse, a counsel rather long and very earnest. At last Anthea detached herself from the group, and went back to the Priest. “Look here,” she said in her kind little voice, “we want to be friends. We want to help you. Let’s make a treaty. Let’s join together to  get  the Amulet—the whole one, I mean. And then it shall belong to you as much as to us, and we shall all get our hearts’ desire.” “Fair words,” said the Priest, “grow no onions.” “ We  say, ‘Butter no parsnips’,” Jane put in. “But don’t you see we  want  to be fair? Only we want to bind you in the chains of honour and upright dealing.” “Will you deal fairly by us?” said Robert. “I will,” said the Priest. “By the sacred, secret name that is written under the Altar of Amen-Rā, I will deal fairly by you. Will you, too, take the oath of honourable partnership?” “No,” said Anthea, on the instant, and added rather rashly, “We don’t swear in England, except in police courts, where the guards are, you know, and you don’t want to go there. But when we  say  we’ll do a thing—it’s the same as an oath to us—we do it. You trust us, and we’ll trust you.” She began to unbind his legs, and the boys hastened to untie his arms. When he was free he stood up, stretched his arms, and laughed. “Now,” he said, “I am stronger than you and my oath is void. I have sworn by nothing, and my oath is nothing likewise. For there  is  no secret, sacred name under the altar of Amen-Rā.” “Oh, yes there is!” said a voice from under the bed. Everyone started—Rekh-marā most of all. Cyril stooped and pulled out the bath of sand where the Psammead slept. “You don’t know everything, though you  are  a Divine Father of the Temple of Amen,” said the Psammead shaking itself till the sand fell tinkling on the bath edge. “There  is  a secret, sacred name beneath the altar of Amen-Rā. Shall I call on that name?” “No, no!” cried the Priest in terror. “No,” said Jane, too. “Don’t let’s have any calling names.” “Besides,” said Rekh-marā, who had turned very white indeed under his natural brownness, “I was only going to say that though there isn’t any name under—” “There  is ,” said the Psammead threateningly. “Well, even if there  wasn’t , I will be bound by the wordless oath of your strangely upright land, and having said that I will be your friend—I will be it.” “Then that’s all right,” said the Psammead; “and there’s the tea-bell. What are you going to do with your distinguished partner? He can’t go down to tea like that, you know.” “You see we can’t do anything till the 3rd of December,” said Anthea, “that’s when we are to find the whole charm. What can we do with Rekh-marā till then?” “Box-room,” said Cyril briefly, “and smuggle up his meals. It will be rather fun.” “Like a fleeing Cavalier concealed from exasperated Roundheads,” said Robert. “Yes.” So Rekh-marā was taken up to the box-room and made as comfortable as possible in a snug nook between an old nursery fender and the wreck of a big four-poster. They gave him a big rag-bag to sit on, and an old, moth-eaten fur coat off the nail on the door to keep him warm. And when they had had their own tea they took him some. He did not like the tea at all, but he liked the bread and butter, and cake that went with it. They took it in turns to sit with him during the evening, and left him fairly happy and quite settled for the night. But when they went up in the morning with a kipper, a quarter of which each of them had gone without at breakfast, Rekh-marā was gone! There was the cosy corner with the rag-bag, and the moth-eaten fur coat—but the cosy corner was empty. “Good riddance!” was naturally the first delightful thought in each mind. The second was less pleasing, because everyone at once remembered that since his Amulet had been swallowed up by theirs—which hung once more round the neck of Jane—he could have no possible means of returning to his Egyptian past. Therefore he must be still in England, and probably somewhere quite near them, plotting mischief. The attic was searched, to prevent mistakes, but quite vainly. “The best thing we can do,” said Cyril, “is to go through the half Amulet straight away, get the whole Amulet, and come back.” “I don’t know,” Anthea hesitated. “Would that be quite fair? Perhaps he isn’t really a base deceiver. Perhaps something’s happened to him.” “Happened?” said Cyril, “not it! Besides, what  could  happen?” “I don’t know,” said Anthea. “Perhaps burglars came in the night, and accidentally killed him, and took away the—all that was mortal of him, you know—to avoid discovery.” “Or perhaps,” said Cyril, “they hid the—all that was mortal, in one of those big trunks in the box-room.  Shall we go back and look? ” he added grimly. “No, no!” Jane shuddered. “Let’s go and tell the Psammead and see what it says.” “No,” said Anthea, “let’s ask the learned gentleman. If anything  has  happened to Rekh-marā a gentleman’s advice would be more useful than a Psammead’s. And the learned gentleman’ll only think it’s a dream, like he always does.” They tapped at the door, and on the “Come in” entered. The learned gentleman was sitting in front of his untasted breakfast. Opposite him, in the easy chair, sat Rekh-marā! “Hush!” said the learned gentleman very earnestly, “please, hush! or the dream will go. I am learning... Oh, what have I not learned in the last hour!” “In the grey dawn,” said the Priest, “I left my hiding-place, and finding myself among these treasures from my own country, I remained. I feel more at home here somehow.” “Of course I know it’s a dream,” said the learned gentleman feverishly, “but, oh, ye gods! what a dream! By Jove!...” “Call not upon the gods,” said the Priest, “lest ye raise greater ones than ye can control. Already,” he explained to the children, “he and I are as brothers, and his welfare is dear to me as my own.” “He has told me,” the learned gentleman began, but Robert interrupted. This was no moment for manners. “Have you told him,” he asked the Priest, “all about the Amulet?” “No,” said Rekh-marā. “Then tell him now. He is very learned. Perhaps he can tell us what to do.” Rekh-marā hesitated, then told—and, oddly enough, none of the children ever could remember afterwards what it was that he did tell. Perhaps he used some magic to prevent their remembering. When he had done the learned gentleman was silent, leaning his elbow on the table and his head on his hand. “Dear Jimmy,” said Anthea gently, “don’t worry about it. We are sure to find it today, somehow.” “Yes,” said Rekh-marā, “and perhaps, with it, Death.” “It’s to bring us our hearts’ desire,” said Robert. “Who knows,” said the Priest, “what things undreamed-of and infinitely desirable lie beyond the dark gates?” “Oh,  don’t ,” said Jane, almost whimpering. The learned gentleman raised his head suddenly. “Why not,” he suggested, “go back into the Past? At a moment when the Amulet is unwatched. Wish to be with it, and that it shall be under your hand.” It was the simplest thing in the world! And yet none of them had ever thought of it. “Come,” cried Rekh-marā, leaping up. “Come  now! ” “May—may I come?” the learned gentleman timidly asked. “It’s only a dream, you know.” “Come, and welcome, oh brother,” Rekh-marā was beginning, but Cyril and Robert with one voice cried, “ No .” “You weren’t with us in Atlantis,” Robert added, “or you’d know better than to let him come.” “Dear Jimmy,” said Anthea, “please don’t ask to come. We’ll go and be back again before you have time to know that we’re gone.” “And he, too?” “We must keep together,” said Rekh-marā, “since there is but one perfect Amulet to which I and these children have equal claims.” Jane held up the Amulet—Rekh-marā went first—and they all passed through the great arch into which the Amulet grew at the Name of Power. The learned gentleman saw through the arch a darkness lighted by smoky gleams. He rubbed his eyes. And he only rubbed them for ten seconds. The children and the Priest were in a small, dark chamber. A square doorway of massive stone let in gleams of shifting light, and the sound of many voices chanting a slow, strange hymn. They stood listening. Now and then the chant quickened and the light grew brighter, as though fuel had been thrown on a fire. “Where are we?” whispered Anthea. “And when?” whispered Robert. “This is some shrine near the beginnings of belief,” said the Egyptian shivering. “Take the Amulet and come away. It is cold here in the morning of the world.” And then Jane felt that her hand was on a slab or table of stone, and, under her hand, something that felt like the charm that had so long hung round her neck, only it was thicker. Twice as thick. “It’s  here! ” she said, “I’ve got it!” And she hardly knew the sound of her own voice. “Come away,” repeated Rekh-marā. “I wish we could see more of this Temple,” said Robert resistingly. “Come away,” the Priest urged, “there is death all about, and strong magic. Listen.” The chanting voices seemed to have grown louder and fiercer, and light stronger. “They are coming!” cried Rekh-marā. “Quick, quick, the Amulet!” Jane held it up. “What a long time you’ve been rubbing your eyes!” said Anthea; “don’t you see we’ve got back?” The learned gentleman merely stared at her. “Miss Anthea—Miss Jane!” It was Nurse’s voice, very much higher and squeaky and more exalted than usual. “Oh, bother!” said everyone. Cyril adding, “You just go on with the dream for a sec, Mr Jimmy, we’ll be back directly. Nurse’ll come up if we don’t.  She  wouldn’t think Rekh-marā was a dream.” Then they went down. Nurse was in the hall, an orange envelope in one hand, and a pink paper in the other. “Your Pa and Ma’s come home. ‘Reach London 11.15. Prepare rooms as directed in letter’, and signed in their two names.” “Oh, hooray! hooray! hooray!” shouted the boys and Jane. But Anthea could not shout, she was nearer crying. “Oh,” she said almost in a whisper, “then it  was  true. And we  have  got our hearts’ desire.” “But I don’t understand about the letter,” Nurse was saying. “I haven’t  had  no letter.” “ Oh! ” said Jane in a queer voice, “I wonder whether it was one of those... they came that night—you know, when we were playing ‘devil in the dark’—and I put them in the hat-stand drawer, behind the clothes-brushes and”—she pulled out the drawer as she spoke—“and here they are!” There was a letter for Nurse and one for the children. The letters told how Father had done being a war-correspondent and was coming home; and how Mother and The Lamb were going to meet him in Italy and all come home together; and how The Lamb and Mother were quite well; and how a telegram would be sent to tell the day and the hour of their home-coming. “Mercy me!” said old Nurse. “I declare if it’s not too bad of you, Miss Jane. I shall have a nice to-do getting things straight for your Pa and Ma.” “Oh, never mind, Nurse,” said Jane, hugging her; “isn’t it just too lovely for anything!” “We’ll come and help you,” said Cyril. “There’s just something upstairs we’ve got to settle up, and then we’ll all come and help you.” “Get along with you,” said old Nurse, but she laughed jollily. “Nice help  you’d  be. I know you. And it’s ten o’clock now.” There was, in fact, something upstairs that they had to settle. Quite a considerable something, too. And it took much longer than they expected. A hasty rush into the boys’ room secured the Psammead, very sandy and very cross. “It doesn’t matter how cross and sandy it is though,” said Anthea, “it ought to be there at the final council.” “It’ll give the learned gentleman fits, I expect,” said Robert, “when he sees it.” But it didn’t. “The dream is growing more and more wonderful,” he exclaimed, when the Psammead had been explained to him by Rekh-marā. “I have dreamed this beast before.” “Now,” said Robert, “Jane has got the half Amulet and I’ve got the whole. Show up, Jane.” Jane untied the string and laid her half Amulet on the table, littered with dusty papers, and the clay cylinders marked all over with little marks like the little prints of birds’ little feet. Robert laid down the whole Amulet, and Anthea gently restrained the eager hand of the learned gentleman as it reached out yearningly towards the “perfect specimen”. And then, just as before on the Marcella quilt, so now on the dusty litter of papers and curiosities, the half Amulet quivered and shook, and then, as steel is drawn to a magnet, it was drawn across the dusty manuscripts, nearer and nearer to the perfect Amulet, warm from the pocket of Robert. And then, as one drop of water mingles with another when the panes of the window are wrinkled with rain, as one bead of mercury is drawn into another bead, the half Amulet, that was the children’s and was also Rekh-marā’s,—slipped into the whole Amulet, and, behold! there was only one—the perfect and ultimate Charm. “And  that’s  all right,” said the Psammead, breaking a breathless silence. “Yes,” said Anthea, “and we’ve got our hearts’ desire. Father and Mother and The Lamb are coming home today.” “But what about me?” said Rekh-marā. “What  is  your heart’s desire?” Anthea asked. “Great and deep learning,” said the Priest, without a moment’s hesitation. “A learning greater and deeper than that of any man of my land and my time. But learning too great is useless. If I go back to my own land and my own age, who will believe my tales of what I have seen in the future? Let me stay here, be the great knower of all that has been, in that our time, so living to me, so old to you, about which your learned men speculate unceasingly, and often,  he  tells me, vainly.” “If I were you,” said the Psammead, “I should ask the Amulet about that. It’s a dangerous thing, trying to live in a time that’s not your own. You can’t breathe an air that’s thousands of centuries ahead of your lungs without feeling the effects of it, sooner or later. Prepare the mystic circle and consult the Amulet.” “Oh,  what  a dream!” cried the learned gentleman. “Dear children, if you love me—and I think you do, in dreams and out of them—prepare the mystic circle and consult the Amulet!” They did. As once before, when the sun had shone in August splendour, they crouched in a circle on the floor. Now the air outside was thick and yellow with the fog that by some strange decree always attends the Cattle Show week. And in the street costers were shouting. “Ur Hekau Setcheh,” Jane said the Name of Power. And instantly the light went out, and all the sounds went out too, so that there was a silence and a darkness, both deeper than any darkness or silence that you have ever even dreamed of imagining. It was like being deaf or blind, only darker and quieter even than that. Then out of that vast darkness and silence came a light and a voice. The light was too faint to see anything by, and the voice was too small for you to hear what it said. But the light and the voice grew. And the light was the light that no man may look on and live, and the voice was the sweetest and most terrible voice in the world. The children cast down their eyes. And so did everyone. “I speak,” said the voice. “What is it that you would hear?” There was a pause. Everyone was afraid to speak. “What are we to do about Rekh-marā?” said Robert suddenly and abruptly. “Shall he go back through the Amulet to his own time, or—” “No one can pass through the Amulet now,” said the beautiful, terrible voice, “to any land or any time. Only when it was imperfect could such things be. But men may pass through the perfect charm to the perfect union, which is not of time or space.” “Would you be so very kind,” said Anthea tremulously, “as to speak so that we can understand you? The Psammead said something about Rekh-marā not being able to live here, and if he can’t get back—” She stopped, her heart was beating desperately in her throat, as it seemed. “Nobody can continue to live in a land and in a time not appointed,” said the voice of glorious sweetness. “But a soul may live, if in that other time and land there be found a soul so akin to it as to offer it refuge, in the body of that land and time, that thus they two may be one soul in one body.” The children exchanged discouraged glances. But the eyes of Rekh-marā and the learned gentleman met, and were kind to each other, and promised each other many things, secret and sacred and very beautiful. Anthea saw the look. “Oh, but,” she said, without at all meaning to say it, “dear Jimmy’s soul isn’t at all like Rekh-marā’s. I’m certain it isn’t. I don’t want to be rude, but it  isn’t , you know. Dear Jimmy’s soul is as good as gold, and—” “Nothing that is not good can pass beneath the double arch of my perfect Amulet,” said the voice. “If both are willing, say the word of Power, and let the two souls become one for ever and ever more.” “Shall I?” asked Jane. “Yes.” “Yes.” The voices were those of the Egyptian Priest and the learned gentleman, and the voices were eager, alive, thrilled with hope and the desire of great things. So Jane took the Amulet from Robert and held it up between the two men, and said, for the last time, the word of Power. “Ur Hekau Setcheh.” The perfect Amulet grew into a double arch; the two arches leaned to each other Λ making a great A. “A stands for Amen,” whispered Jane; “what he was a priest of.” “Hush!” breathed Anthea. The great double arch glowed in and through the green light that had been there since the Name of Power had first been spoken—it glowed with a light more bright yet more soft than the other light—a glory and splendour and sweetness unspeakable. “Come!” cried Rekh-marā, holding out his hands. “Come!” cried the learned gentleman, and he also held out his hands. Each moved forward under the glowing, glorious arch of the perfect Amulet. Then Rekh-marā quavered and shook, and as steel is drawn to a magnet he was drawn, under the arch of magic, nearer and nearer to the learned gentleman. And, as one drop of water mingles with another, when the window-glass is rain-wrinkled, as one quick-silver bead is drawn to another quick-silver bead, Rekh-marā, Divine Father of the Temple of Amen-Rā, was drawn into, slipped into, disappeared into, and was one with Jimmy, the good, the beloved, the learned gentleman. And suddenly it was good daylight and the December sun shone. The fog has passed away like a dream. The Amulet was there—little and complete in Jane’s hand, and there were the other children and the Psammead, and the learned gentleman. But Rekh-marā—or the body of Rekh-marā—was not there any more. As for his soul... “Oh, the horrid thing!” cried Robert, and put his foot on a centipede as long as your finger, that crawled and wriggled and squirmed at the learned gentleman’s feet. “ That ,” said the Psammead, “was the evil in the soul of Rekh-marā.” There was a deep silence. “Then Rekh-marā’s  him  now?” said Jane at last. “All that was good in Rekh-marā,” said the Psammead. “ He  ought to have his heart’s desire, too,” said Anthea, in a sort of stubborn gentleness. “ His  heart’s desire,” said the Psammead, “is the perfect Amulet you hold in your hand. Yes—and has been ever since he first saw the broken half of it.” “We’ve got ours,” said Anthea softly. “Yes,” said the Psammead—its voice was crosser than they had ever heard it—“your parents are coming home. And what’s to become of  me?  I shall be found out, and made a show of, and degraded in every possible way. I  know  they’ll make me go into Parliament—hateful place—all mud and no sand. That beautiful Baalbec temple in the desert! Plenty of good sand there, and no politics! I wish I were there, safe in the Past—that I do.” “I wish you were,” said the learned gentleman absently, yet polite as ever. The Psammead swelled itself up, turned its long snail’s eyes in one last lingering look at Anthea—a loving look, she always said, and thought—and—vanished. “Well,” said Anthea, after a silence, “I suppose it’s happy. The only thing it ever did really care for was  sand .” “My dear children,” said the learned gentleman, “I must have fallen asleep. I’ve had the most extraordinary dream.” “I hope it was a nice one,” said Cyril with courtesy. “Yes.... I feel a new man after it. Absolutely a new man.” There was a ring at the front-door bell. The opening of a door. Voices. “It’s  them! ” cried Robert, and a thrill ran through four hearts. “Here!” cried Anthea, snatching the Amulet from Jane and pressing it into the hand of the learned gentleman. “Here—it’s  yours —your very own—a present from us, because you’re Rekh-marā as well as... I mean, because you’re such a dear.” She hugged him briefly but fervently, and the four swept down the stairs to the hall, where a cabman was bringing in boxes, and where, heavily disguised in travelling cloaks and wraps, was their hearts’ desire—three-fold—Mother, Father, and The Lamb. “Bless me!” said the learned gentleman, left alone, “bless me! What a treasure! The dear children! It must be their affection that has given me these luminous  aperçus . I seem to see so many things now—things I never saw before! The dear children! The dear, dear children!” CHAPTER 1. THE EGG It began with the day when it was almost the Fifth of November, and a doubt arose in some breast, Robert’s, I fancy, as to the quality of the fireworks laid in for the Guy Fawkes celebration. ‘They were jolly cheap,’ said whoever it was, and I think it was Robert, ‘and suppose they didn’t go off on the night? Those Prosser kids would have something to snigger about then.’ ‘The ones  I  got are all right,’ Jane said; ‘I know they are, because the man at the shop said they were worth thribble the money, ’ ‘I’m sure thribble isn’t grammar,’ Anthea said. ‘Of course it isn’t,’ said Cyril; ‘one word can’t be grammar all by itself, so you needn’t be so jolly clever.’ Anthea was rummaging in the corner-drawers of her mind for a very disagreeable answer, when she remembered what a wet day it was, and how the boys had been disappointed of that ride to London and back on the top of the tram, which their mother had promised them as a reward for not having once forgotten, for six whole days, to wipe their boots on the mat when they came home from school. So Anthea only said, ‘Don’t be so jolly clever yourself, Squirrel. And the fireworks look all right, and you’ll have the eightpence that your tram fares didn’t cost to-day, to buy something more with. You ought to get a perfectly lovely Catharine wheel for eightpence.’ ‘I daresay,’ said Cyril, coldly; ‘but it’s not YOUR eightpence anyhow, ’ ‘But look here,’ said Robert, ‘really now, about the fireworks. We don’t want to be disgraced before those kids next door. They think because they wear red plush on Sundays no one else is any good.’ ‘I wouldn’t wear plush if it was ever so, unless it was black to be beheaded in, if I was Mary Queen of Scots,’ said Anthea, with scorn. Robert stuck steadily to his point. One great point about Robert is the steadiness with which he can stick. ‘I think we ought to test them,’ he said. ‘You young duffer,’ said Cyril, ‘fireworks are like postage-stamps. You can only use them once.’ ‘What do you suppose it means by “Carter’s tested seeds” in the advertisement?’ There was a blank silence. Then Cyril touched his forehead with his finger and shook his head. ‘A little wrong here,’ he said. ‘I was always afraid of that with poor Robert. All that cleverness, you know, and being top in algebra so often, it’s bound to tell, ’ ‘Dry up,’ said Robert, fiercely. ‘Don’t you see? You can’t TEST seeds if you do them ALL. You just take a few here and there, and if those grow you can feel pretty sure the others will be, what do you call it?, Father told me, “up to sample”. Don’t you think we ought to sample the fire-works? Just shut our eyes and each draw one out, and then try them.’ ‘But it’s raining cats and dogs,’ said Jane. ‘And Queen Anne is dead,’ rejoined Robert. No one was in a very good temper. ‘We needn’t go out to do them; we can just move back the table, and let them off on the old tea-tray we play toboggans with. I don’t know what YOU think, but  I  think it’s time we did something, and that would be really useful; because then we shouldn’t just HOPE the fireworks would make those Prossers sit up, we should KNOW.’ ‘It WOULD be something to do,’ Cyril owned with languid approval. So the table was moved back. And then the hole in the carpet, that had been near the window till the carpet was turned round, showed most awfully. But Anthea stole out on tip-toe, and got the tray when cook wasn’t looking, and brought it in and put it over the hole. Then all the fireworks were put on the table, and each of the four children shut its eyes very tight and put out its hand and grasped something. Robert took a cracker, Cyril and Anthea had Roman candles; but Jane’s fat paw closed on the gem of the whole collection, the Jack-in-the-box that had cost two shillings, and one at least of the party, I will not say which, because it was sorry afterwards, declared that Jane had done it on purpose. Nobody was pleased. For the worst of it was that these four children, with a very proper dislike of anything even faintly bordering on the sneakish, had a law, unalterable as those of the Medes and Persians, that one had to stand by the results of a toss-up, or a drawing of lots, or any other appeal to chance, however much one might happen to dislike the way things were turning out. ‘I didn’t mean to,’ said Jane, near tears. ‘I don’t care, I’ll draw another, ’ ‘You know jolly well you can’t,’ said Cyril, bitterly. ‘It’s settled. It’s Medium and Persian. You’ve done it, and you’ll have to stand by it, and us too, worse luck. Never mind. YOU’LL have your pocket-money before the Fifth. Anyway, we’ll have the Jack-in-the-box LAST, and get the most out of it we can.’ So the cracker and the Roman candles were lighted, and they were all that could be expected for the money; but when it came to the Jack-in-the-box it simply sat in the tray and laughed at them, as Cyril said. They tried to light it with paper and they tried to light it with matches; they tried to light it with Vesuvian fusees from the pocket of father’s second-best overcoat that was hanging in the hall. And then Anthea slipped away to the cupboard under the stairs where the brooms and dustpans were kept, and the rosiny fire-lighters that smell so nice and like the woods where pine-trees grow, and the old newspapers and the bees-wax and turpentine, and the horrid an stiff dark rags that are used for cleaning brass and furniture, and the paraffin for the lamps. She came back with a little pot that had once cost sevenpence-halfpenny when it was full of red-currant jelly; but the jelly had been all eaten long ago, and now Anthea had filled the jar with paraffin. She came in, and she threw the paraffin over the tray just at the moment when Cyril was trying with the twenty-third match to light the Jack-in-the-box. The Jack-in-the-box did not catch fire any more than usual, but the paraffin acted quite differently, and in an instant a hot flash of flame leapt up and burnt off Cyril’s eyelashes, and scorched the faces of all four before they could spring back. They backed, in four instantaneous bounds, as far as they could, which was to the wall, and the pillar of fire reached from floor to ceiling. ‘My hat,’ said Cyril, with emotion, ‘You’ve done it this time, Anthea.’ The flame was spreading out under the ceiling like the rose of fire in Mr Rider Haggard’s exciting story about Allan Quatermain. Robert and Cyril saw that no time was to be lost. They turned up the edges of the carpet, and kicked them over the tray. This cut off the column of fire, and it disappeared and there was nothing left but smoke and a dreadful smell of lamps that have been turned too low. All hands now rushed to the rescue, and the paraffin fire was only a bundle of trampled carpet, when suddenly a sharp crack beneath their feet made the amateur firemen start back. Another crack, the carpet moved as if it had had a cat wrapped in it; the Jack-in-the-box had at last allowed itself to be lighted, and it was going off with desperate violence inside the carpet. Robert, with the air of one doing the only possible thing, rushed to the window and opened it. Anthea screamed, Jane burst into tears, and Cyril turned the table wrong way up on top of the carpet heap. But the firework went on, banging and bursting and spluttering even underneath the table. Next moment mother rushed in, attracted by the howls of Anthea, and in a few moments the firework desisted and there was a dead silence, and the children stood looking at each other’s black faces, and, out of the corners of their eyes, at mother’s white one. The fact that the nursery carpet was ruined occasioned but little surprise, nor was any one really astonished that bed should prove the immediate end of the adventure. It has been said that all roads lead to Rome; this may be true, but at any rate, in early youth I am quite sure that many roads lead to BED, and stop there, or YOU do. The rest of the fireworks were confiscated, and mother was not pleased when father let them off himself in the back garden, though he said, ‘Well, how else can you get rid of them, my dear?’ You see, father had forgotten that the children were in disgrace, and that their bedroom windows looked out on to the back garden. So that they all saw the fireworks most beautifully, and admired the skill with which father handled them. Next day all was forgotten and forgiven; only the nursery had to be deeply cleaned (like spring-cleaning), and the ceiling had to be whitewashed. And mother went out; and just at tea-time next day a man came with a rolled-up carpet, and father paid him, and mother said,  ‘If the carpet isn’t in good condition, you know, I shall expect you to change it.’ And the man replied,  ‘There ain’t a thread gone in it nowhere, mum. It’s a bargain, if ever there was one, and I’m more’n ‘arf sorry I let it go at the price; but we can’t resist the lydies, can we, sir?’ and he winked at father and went away. Then the carpet was put down in the nursery, and sure enough there wasn’t a hole in it anywhere. As the last fold was unrolled something hard and loud-sounding bumped out of it and trundled along the nursery floor. All the children scrambled for it, and Cyril got it. He took it to the gas. It was shaped like an egg, very yellow and shiny, half-transparent, and it had an odd sort of light in it that changed as you held it in different ways. It was as though it was an egg with a yolk of pale fire that just showed through the stone. ‘I MAY keep it, mayn’t I, mother?’ Cyril asked. And of course mother said no; they must take it back to the man who had brought the carpet, because she had only paid for a carpet, and not for a stone egg with a fiery yolk to it. So she told them where the shop was, and it was in the Kentish Town Road, not far from the hotel that is called the Bull and Gate. It was a poky little shop, and the man was arranging furniture outside on the pavement very cunningly, so that the more broken parts should show as little as possible. And directly he saw the children he knew them again, and he began at once, without giving them a chance to speak. ‘No you don’t’ he cried loudly; ‘I ain’t a-goin’ to take back no carpets, so don’t you make no bloomin’ errer. A bargain’s a bargain, and the carpet’s puffik throughout.’ ‘We don’t want you to take it back,’ said Cyril; ‘but we found something in it.’ ‘It must have got into it up at your place, then,’ said the man, with indignant promptness, ‘for there ain’t nothing in nothing as I sell. It’s all as clean as a whistle.’ ‘I never said it wasn’t CLEAN,’ said Cyril, ‘but, ’ ‘Oh, if it’s MOTHS,’ said the man, ‘that’s easy cured with borax. But I expect it was only an odd one. I tell you the carpet’s good through and through. It hadn’t got no moths when it left my ‘ands, not so much as an hegg.’ ‘But that’s just it,’ interrupted Jane; ‘there WAS so much as an egg.’ The man made a sort of rush at the children and stamped his foot. ‘Clear out, I say!’ he shouted, ‘or I’ll call for the police. A nice thing for customers to ‘ear you a-coming ‘ere a-charging me with finding things in goods what I sells. ‘Ere, be off, afore I sends you off with a flea in your ears. Hi! constable, ’ The children fled, and they think, and their father thinks, that they couldn’t have done anything else. Mother has her own opinion. But father said they might keep the egg. ‘The man certainly didn’t know the egg was there when he brought the carpet,’ said he, ‘any more than your mother did, and we’ve as much right to it as he had.’ So the egg was put on the mantelpiece, where it quite brightened up the dingy nursery. The nursery was dingy, because it was a basement room, and its windows looked out on a stone area with a rockery made of clinkers facing the windows. Nothing grew in the rockery except London pride and snails. The room had been described in the house agent’s list as a ‘convenient breakfast-room in basement,’ and in the daytime it was rather dark. This did not matter so much in the evenings when the gas was alight, but then it was in the evening that the blackbeetles got so sociable, and used to come out of the low cupboards on each side of the fireplace where their homes were, and try to make friends with the children. At least, I suppose that was what they wanted, but the children never would. On the Fifth of November father and mother went to the theatre, and the children were not happy, because the Prossers next door had lots of fireworks and they had none. They were not even allowed to have a bonfire in the garden. ‘No more playing with fire, thank you,’ was father’s answer, when they asked him. When the baby had been put to bed the children sat sadly round the fire in the nursery. ‘I’m beastly bored,’ said Robert. ‘Let’s talk about the Psammead,’ said Anthea, who generally tried to give the conversation a cheerful turn. ‘What’s the good of TALKING?’ said Cyril. ‘What I want is for something to happen. It’s awfully stuffy for a chap not to be allowed out in the evenings. There’s simply nothing to do when you’ve got through your homers.’ Jane finished the last of her home-lessons and shut the book with a bang. ‘We’ve got the pleasure of memory,’ said she. ‘Just think of last holidays.’ Last holidays, indeed, offered something to think of, for they had been spent in the country at a white house between a sand-pit and a gravel-pit, and things had happened. The children had found a Psammead, or sand-fairy, and it had let them have anything they wished for, just exactly anything, with no bother about its not being really for their good, or anything like that. And if you want to know what kind of things they wished for, and how their wishes turned out you can read it all in a book called Five Children and It (It was the Psammead). If you’ve not read it, perhaps I ought to tell you that the fifth child was the baby brother, who was called the Lamb, because the first thing he ever said was ‘Baa!’ and that the other children were not particularly handsome, nor were they extra clever, nor extraordinarily good. But they were not bad sorts on the whole; in fact, they were rather like you. ‘I don’t want to think about the pleasures of memory,’ said Cyril; ‘I want some more things to happen.’ ‘We’re very much luckier than any one else, as it is,’ said Jane. ‘Why, no one else ever found a Psammead. We ought to be grateful.’ ‘Why shouldn’t we GO ON being, though?’ Cyril asked, ‘lucky, I mean, not grateful. Why’s it all got to stop?’ ‘Perhaps something will happen,’ said Anthea, comfortably. ‘Do you know, sometimes I think we are the sort of people that things DO happen to.’ ‘It’s like that in history,’ said Jane: ‘some kings are full of interesting things, and others, nothing ever happens to them, except their being born and crowned and buried, and sometimes not that.’ ‘I think Panther’s right,’ said Cyril: ‘I think we are the sort of people things do happen to. I have a sort of feeling things would happen right enough if we could only give them a shove. It just wants something to start it. That’s all.’ ‘I wish they taught magic at school,’ Jane sighed. ‘I believe if we could do a little magic it might make something happen.’ ‘I wonder how you begin?’ Robert looked round the room, but he got no ideas from the faded green curtains, or the drab Venetian blinds, or the worn brown oil-cloth on the floor. Even the new carpet suggested nothing, though its pattern was a very wonderful one, and always seemed as though it were just going to make you think of something. ‘I could begin right enough,’ said Anthea; ‘I’ve read lots about it. But I believe it’s wrong in the Bible.’ ‘It’s only wrong in the Bible because people wanted to hurt other people. I don’t see how things can be wrong unless they hurt somebody, and we don’t want to hurt anybody; and what’s more, we jolly well couldn’t if we tried. Let’s get the Ingoldsby Legends. There’s a thing about Abra-cadabra there,’ said Cyril, yawning. ‘We may as well play at magic. Let’s be Knights Templars. They were awfully gone on magic. They used to work spells or something with a goat and a goose. Father says so.’ ‘Well, that’s all right,’ said Robert, unkindly; ‘you can play the goat right enough, and Jane knows how to be a goose.’ ‘I’ll get Ingoldsby,’ said Anthea, hastily. ‘You turn up the hearthrug.’ So they traced strange figures on the linoleum, where the hearthrug had kept it clean. They traced them with chalk that Robert had nicked from the top of the mathematical master’s desk at school. You know, of course, that it is stealing to take a new stick of chalk, but it is not wrong to take a broken piece, so long as you only take one. (I do not know the reason of this rule, nor who made it.) And they chanted all the gloomiest songs they could think of. And, of course, nothing happened. So then Anthea said, ‘I’m sure a magic fire ought to be made of sweet-smelling wood, and have magic gums and essences and things in it.’ ‘I don’t know any sweet-smelling wood, except cedar,’ said Robert; ‘but I’ve got some ends of cedar-wood lead pencil.’ So they burned the ends of lead pencil. And still nothing happened. ‘Let’s burn some of the eucalyptus oil we have for our colds,’ said Anthea. And they did. It certainly smelt very strong. And they burned lumps of camphor out of the big chest. It was very bright, and made a horrid black smoke, which looked very magical. But still nothing happened. Then they got some clean tea-cloths from the dresser drawer in the kitchen, and waved them over the magic chalk-tracings, and sang ‘The Hymn of the Moravian Nuns at Bethlehem’, which is very impressive. And still nothing happened. So they waved more and more wildly, and Robert’s tea-cloth caught the golden egg and whisked it off the mantelpiece, and it fell into the fender and rolled under the grate. ‘Oh, crikey!’ said more than one voice. And every one instantly fell down flat on its front to look under the grate, and there lay the egg, glowing in a nest of hot ashes. ‘It’s not smashed, anyhow,’ said Robert, and he put his hand under the grate and picked up the egg. But the egg was much hotter than any one would have believed it could possibly get in such a short time, and Robert had to drop it with a cry of ‘Bother!’ It fell on the top bar of the grate, and bounced right into the glowing red-hot heart of the fire. ‘The tongs!’ cried Anthea. But, alas, no one could remember where they were. Every one had forgotten that the tongs had last been used to fish up the doll’s teapot from the bottom of the water-butt, where the Lamb had dropped it. So the nursery tongs were resting between the water-butt and the dustbin, and cook refused to lend the kitchen ones. ‘Never mind,’ said Robert, ‘we’ll get it out with the poker and the shovel.’ ‘Oh, stop,’ cried Anthea. ‘Look at it! Look! look! look! I do believe something IS going to happen!’ For the egg was now red-hot, and inside it something was moving. Next moment there was a soft cracking sound; the egg burst in two, and out of it came a flame-coloured bird. It rested a moment among the flames, and as it rested there the four children could see it growing bigger and bigger under their eyes. Every mouth was a-gape, every eye a-goggle. The bird rose in its nest of fire, stretched its wings, and flew out into the room. It flew round and round, and round again, and where it passed the air was warm. Then it perched on the fender. The children looked at each other. Then Cyril put out a hand towards the bird. It put its head on one side and looked up at him, as you may have seen a parrot do when it is just going to speak, so that the children were hardly astonished at all when it said, ‘Be careful; I am not nearly cool yet.’ They were not astonished, but they were very, very much interested. They looked at the bird, and it was certainly worth looking at. Its feathers were like gold. It was about as large as a bantam, only its beak was not at all bantam-shaped. ‘I believe I know what it is,’ said Robert. ‘I’ve seen a picture.’ He hurried away. A hasty dash and scramble among the papers on father’s study table yielded, as the sum-books say, ‘the desired result’. But when he came back into the room holding out a paper, and crying, ‘I say, look here,’ the others all said ‘Hush!’ and he hushed obediently and instantly, for the bird was speaking. ‘Which of you,’ it was saying, ‘put the egg into the fire?’ ‘He did,’ said three voices, and three fingers pointed at Robert. The bird bowed; at least it was more like that than anything else. ‘I am your grateful debtor,’ it said with a high-bred air. The children were all choking with wonder and curiosity, all except Robert. He held the paper in his hand, and he KNEW. He said so. He said,  ‘ I  know who you are.’ And he opened and displayed a printed paper, at the head of which was a little picture of a bird sitting in a nest of flames. ‘You are the Phoenix,’ said Robert; and the bird was quite pleased. ‘My fame has lived then for two thousand years,’ it said. ‘Allow me to look at my portrait.’ It looked at the page which Robert, kneeling down, spread out in the fender, and said,  ‘It’s not a flattering likeness... And what are these characters?’ it asked, pointing to the printed part. ‘Oh, that’s all dullish; it’s not much about YOU, you know,’ said Cyril, with unconscious politeness; ‘but you’re in lots of books.’ ‘With portraits?’ asked the Phoenix. ‘Well, no,’ said Cyril; ‘in fact, I don’t think I ever saw any portrait of you but that one, but I can read you something about yourself, if you like.’ The Phoenix nodded, and Cyril went off and fetched Volume X of the old Encyclopedia, and on page 246 he found the following:,  ‘Phoenix, in ornithology, a fabulous bird of antiquity.’ ‘Antiquity is quite correct,’ said the Phoenix, ‘but fabulous, well, do I look it?’ Every one shook its head. Cyril went on,  ‘The ancients speak of this bird as single, or the only one of its kind.’ ‘That’s right enough,’ said the Phoenix. ‘They describe it as about the size of an eagle.’ ‘Eagles are of different sizes,’ said the Phoenix; ‘it’s not at all a good description.’ All the children were kneeling on the hearthrug, to be as near the Phoenix as possible. ‘You’ll boil your brains,’ it said. ‘Look out, I’m nearly cool now;’ and with a whirr of golden wings it fluttered from the fender to the table. It was so nearly cool that there was only a very faint smell of burning when it had settled itself on the table-cloth. ‘It’s only a very little scorched,’ said the Phoenix, apologetically; ‘it will come out in the wash. Please go on reading.’ The children gathered round the table. ‘The size of an eagle,’ Cyril went on, ‘its head finely crested with a beautiful plumage, its neck covered with feathers of a gold colour, and the rest of its body purple; only the tail white, and the eyes sparkling like stars. They say that it lives about five hundred years in the wilderness, and when advanced in age it builds itself a pile of sweet wood and aromatic gums, fires it with the wafting of its wings, and thus burns itself; and that from its ashes arises a worm, which in time grows up to be a Phoenix. Hence the Phoenicians gave, ’ ‘Never mind what they gave,’ said the Phoenix, ruffling its golden feathers. ‘They never gave much, anyway; they always were people who gave nothing for nothing. That book ought to be destroyed. It’s most inaccurate. The rest of my body was never purple, and as for my, tail, well, I simply ask you, IS it white?’ It turned round and gravely presented its golden tail to the children. ‘No, it’s not,’ said everybody. ‘No, and it never was,’ said the Phoenix. ‘And that about the worm is just a vulgar insult. The Phoenix has an egg, like all respectable birds. It makes a pile, that part’s all right, and it lays its egg, and it burns itself; and it goes to sleep and wakes up in its egg, and comes out and goes on living again, and so on for ever and ever. I can’t tell you how weary I got of it, such a restless existence; no repose.’ ‘But how did your egg get HERE?’ asked Anthea. ‘Ah, that’s my life-secret,’ said the Phoenix. ‘I couldn’t tell it to any one who wasn’t really sympathetic. I’ve always been a misunderstood bird. You can tell that by what they say about the worm. I might tell YOU,’ it went on, looking at Robert with eyes that were indeed starry. ‘You put me on the fire, ’ Robert looked uncomfortable. ‘The rest of us made the fire of sweet-scented woods and gums, though,’ said Cyril. ‘And, and it was an accident my putting you on the fire,’ said Robert, telling the truth with some difficulty, for he did not know how the Phoenix might take it. It took it in the most unexpected manner. ‘Your candid avowal,’ it said, ‘removes my last scruple. I will tell you my story.’ ‘And you won’t vanish, or anything sudden will you? asked Anthea, anxiously. ‘Why?’ it asked, puffing out the golden feathers, ‘do you wish me to stay here?’ ‘Oh YES,’ said every one, with unmistakable sincerity. ‘Why?’ asked the Phoenix again, looking modestly at the table-cloth. ‘Because,’ said every one at once, and then stopped short; only Jane added after a pause, ‘you are the most beautiful person we’ve ever seen.’ ‘You are a sensible child,’ said the Phoenix, ‘and I will NOT vanish or anything sudden. And I will tell you my tale. I had resided, as your book says, for many thousand years in the wilderness, which is a large, quiet place with very little really good society, and I was becoming weary of the monotony of my existence. But I acquired the habit of laying my egg and burning myself every five hundred years, and you know how difficult it is to break yourself of a habit.’ ‘Yes,’ said Cyril; ‘Jane used to bite her nails.’ ‘But I broke myself of it,’ urged Jane, rather hurt, ‘You know I did.’ ‘Not till they put bitter aloes on them,’ said Cyril. ‘I doubt,’ said the bird, gravely, ‘whether even bitter aloes (the aloe, by the way, has a bad habit of its own, which it might well cure before seeking to cure others; I allude to its indolent practice of flowering but once a century), I doubt whether even bitter aloes could have cured ME. But I WAS cured. I awoke one morning from a feverish dream, it was getting near the time for me to lay that tiresome fire and lay that tedious egg upon it, and I saw two people, a man and a woman. They were sitting on a carpet, and when I accosted them civilly they narrated to me their life-story, which, as you have not yet heard it, I will now proceed to relate. They were a prince and princess, and the story of their parents was one which I am sure you will like to hear. In early youth the mother of the princess happened to hear the story of a certain enchanter, and in that story I am sure you will be interested. The enchanter, ’ ‘Oh, please don’t,’ said Anthea. ‘I can’t understand all these beginnings of stories, and you seem to be getting deeper and deeper in them every minute. Do tell us your OWN story. That’s what we really want to hear.’ ‘Well,’ said the Phoenix, seeming on the whole rather flattered, ‘to cut about seventy long stories short (though  I  had to listen to them all, but to be sure in the wilderness there is plenty of time), this prince and princess were so fond of each other that they did not want any one else, and the enchanter, don’t be alarmed, I won’t go into his history, had given them a magic carpet (you’ve heard of a magic carpet?), and they had just sat on it and told it to take them right away from every one, and it had brought them to the wilderness. And as they meant to stay there they had no further use for the carpet, so they gave it to me. That was indeed the chance of a lifetime!’ ‘I don’t see what you wanted with a carpet,’ said Jane, ‘when you’ve got those lovely wings.’ ‘They ARE nice wings, aren’t they?’ said the Phoenix, simpering and spreading them out. ‘Well, I got the prince to lay out the carpet, and I laid my egg on it; then I said to the carpet, “Now, my excellent carpet, prove your worth. Take that egg somewhere where it can’t be hatched for two thousand years, and where, when that time’s up, some one will light a fire of sweet wood and aromatic gums, and put the egg in to hatch;”  and you see it’s all come out exactly as I said. The words were no sooner out of my beak than egg and carpet disappeared. The royal lovers assisted to arrange my pile, and soothed my last moments. I burnt myself up and knew no more till I awoke on yonder altar.’ It pointed its claw at the grate. ‘But the carpet,’ said Robert, ‘the magic carpet that takes you anywhere you wish. What became of that?’ ‘Oh, THAT?’ said the Phoenix, carelessly, ‘I should say that that is the carpet. I remember the pattern perfectly.’ It pointed as it spoke to the floor, where lay the carpet which mother had bought in the Kentish Town Road for twenty-two shillings and ninepence. At that instant father’s latch-key was heard in the door. ‘OH,’ whispered Cyril, ‘now we shall catch it for not being in bed!’ ‘Wish yourself there,’ said the Phoenix, in a hurried whisper, ‘and then wish the carpet back in its place.’ No sooner said than done. It made one a little giddy, certainly, and a little breathless; but when things seemed right way up again, there the children were, in bed, and the lights were out. They heard the soft voice of the Phoenix through the darkness. ‘I shall sleep on the cornice above your curtains,’ it said. ‘Please don’t mention me to your kinsfolk.’ ‘Not much good,’ said Robert, ‘they’d never believe us. I say,’ he called through the half-open door to the girls; ‘talk about adventures and things happening. We ought to be able to get some fun out of a magic carpet AND a Phoenix.’ ‘Rather,’ said the girls, in bed. ‘Children,’ said father, on the stairs, ‘go to sleep at once. What do you mean by talking at this time of night?’ No answer was expected to this question, but under the bedclothes Cyril murmured one. ‘Mean?’ he said. ‘Don’t know what we mean. I don’t know what anything means.’ ‘But we’ve got a magic carpet AND a Phoenix,’ said Robert. ‘You’ll get something else if father comes in and catches you,’ said Cyril. ‘Shut up, I tell you.’ Robert shut up. But he knew as well as you do that the adventures of that carpet and that Phoenix were only just beginning. Father and mother had not the least idea of what had happened in their absence. This is often the case, even when there are no magic carpets or Phoenixes in the house. The next morning, but I am sure you would rather wait till the next chapter before you hear about THAT. CHAPTER 2. THE TOPLESS TOWER The children had seen the Phoenix-egg hatched in the flames in their own nursery grate, and had heard from it how the carpet on their own nursery floor was really the wishing carpet, which would take them anywhere they chose. The carpet had transported them to bed just at the right moment, and the Phoenix had gone to roost on the cornice supporting the window-curtains of the boys’ room. ‘Excuse me,’ said a gentle voice, and a courteous beak opened, very kindly and delicately, the right eye of Cyril. ‘I hear the slaves below preparing food. Awaken! A word of explanation and arrangement... I do wish you wouldn’t, ’ The Phoenix stopped speaking and fluttered away crossly to the cornice-pole; for Cyril had hit out, as boys do when they are awakened suddenly, and the Phoenix was not used to boys, and his feelings, if not his wings, were hurt. ‘Sorry,’ said Cyril, coming awake all in a minute. ‘Do come back! What was it you were saying? Something about bacon and rations?’ The Phoenix fluttered back to the brass rail at the foot of the bed. ‘I say, you ARE real,’ said Cyril. ‘How ripping! And the carpet?’ ‘The carpet is as real as it ever was,’ said the Phoenix, rather contemptuously; ‘but, of course, a carpet’s only a carpet, whereas a Phoenix is superlatively a Phoenix.’ ‘Yes, indeed,’ said Cyril, ‘I see it is. Oh, what luck! Wake up, Bobs! There’s jolly well something to wake up for today. And it’s Saturday, too.’ ‘I’ve been reflecting,’ said the Phoenix, ‘during the silent watches of the night, and I could not avoid the conclusion that you were quite insufficiently astonished at my appearance yesterday. The ancients were always VERY surprised. Did you, by chance, EXPECT my egg to hatch?’ ‘Not us,’ Cyril said. ‘And if we had,’ said Anthea, who had come in in her nightie when she heard the silvery voice of the Phoenix, ‘we could never, never have expected it to hatch anything so splendid as you.’ The bird smiled. Perhaps you’ve never seen a bird smile? ‘You see,’ said Anthea, wrapping herself in the boys’ counterpane, for the morning was chill, ‘we’ve had things happen to us before;’ and she told the story of the Psammead, or sand-fairy. ‘Ah yes,’ said the Phoenix; ‘Psammeads were rare, even in my time. I remember I used to be called the Psammead of the Desert. I was always having compliments paid me; I can’t think why.’ ‘Can YOU give wishes, then?’ asked Jane, who had now come in too. ‘Oh, dear me, no,’ said the Phoenix, contemptuously, ‘at least, but I hear footsteps approaching. I hasten to conceal myself.’ And it did. I think I said that this day was Saturday. It was also cook’s birthday, and mother had allowed her and Eliza to go to the Crystal Palace with a party of friends, so Jane and Anthea of course had to help to make beds and to wash up the breakfast cups, and little things like that. Robert and Cyril intended to spend the morning in conversation with the Phoenix, but the bird had its own ideas about this. ‘I must have an hour or two’s quiet,’ it said, ‘I really must. My nerves will give way unless I can get a little rest. You must remember it’s two thousand years since I had any conversation, I’m out of practice, and I must take care of myself. I’ve often been told that mine is a valuable life.’ So it nestled down inside an old hatbox of father’s, which had been brought down from the box-room some days before, when a helmet was suddenly needed for a game of tournaments, with its golden head under its golden wing, and went to sleep. So then Robert and Cyril moved the table back and were going to sit on the carpet and wish themselves somewhere else. But before they could decide on the place, Cyril said,  ‘I don’t know. Perhaps it’s rather sneakish to begin without the girls.’ ‘They’ll be all the morning,’ said Robert, impatiently. And then a thing inside him, which tiresome books sometimes call the ‘inward monitor’, said, ‘Why don’t you help them, then?’ Cyril’s ‘inward monitor’ happened to say the same thing at the same moment, so the boys went and helped to wash up the tea-cups, and to dust the drawing-room. Robert was so interested that he proposed to clean the front doorsteps, a thing he had never been allowed to do. Nor was he allowed to do it on this occasion. One reason was that it had already been done by cook. When all the housework was finished, the girls dressed the happy, wriggling baby in his blue highwayman coat and three-cornered hat, and kept him amused while mother changed her dress and got ready to take him over to granny’s. Mother always went to granny’s every Saturday, and generally some of the children went with her; but today they were to keep house. And their hearts were full of joyous and delightful feelings every time they remembered that the house they would have to keep had a Phoenix in it, AND a wishing carpet. You can always keep the Lamb good and happy for quite a long time if you play the Noah’s Ark game with him. It is quite simple. He just sits on your lap and tells you what animal he is, and then you say the little poetry piece about whatever animal he chooses to be. Of course, some of the animals, like the zebra and the tiger, haven’t got any poetry, because they are so difficult to rhyme to. The Lamb knows quite well which are the poetry animals. ‘I’m a baby bear!’ said the Lamb, snugging down; and Anthea began:      ‘I love my little baby bear,      I love his nose and toes and hair;      I like to hold him in my arm,      And keep him VERY safe and warm.’ And when she said ‘very’, of course there was a real bear’s hug. Then came the eel, and the Lamb was tickled till he wriggled exactly like a real one:      ‘I love my little baby eel,      He is so squidglety to feel;      He’ll be an eel when he is big,       But now he’s just, a, tiny SNIG!’ Perhaps you didn’t know that a snig was a baby eel? It is, though, and the Lamb knew it. ‘Hedgehog now-!’ he said; and Anthea went on:      ‘My baby hedgehog, how I like ye,      Though your back’s so prickly-spiky;      Your front is very soft, I’ve found,      So I must love you front ways round!’ And then she loved him front ways round, while he squealed with pleasure. It is a very baby game, and, of course, the rhymes are only meant for very, very small people, not for people who are old enough to read books, so I won’t tell you any more of them. By the time the Lamb had been a baby lion and a baby weazel, and a baby rabbit and a baby rat, mother was ready; and she and the Lamb, having been kissed by everybody and hugged as thoroughly as it is possible to be when you’re dressed for out-of-doors, were seen to the tram by the boys. When the boys came back, every one looked at every one else and said,  ‘Now!’ They locked the front door and they locked the back door, and they fastened all the windows. They moved the table and chairs off the carpet, and Anthea swept it. ‘We must show it a LITTLE attention,’ she said kindly. ‘We’ll give it tea-leaves next time. Carpets like tea-leaves.’ Then every one put on its out-door things, because as Cyril said, they didn’t know where they might be going, and it makes people stare if you go out of doors in November in pinafores and without hats. Then Robert gently awoke the Phoenix, who yawned and stretched itself, and allowed Robert to lift it on to the middle of the carpet, where it instantly went to sleep again with its crested head tucked under its golden wing as before. Then every one sat down on the carpet. ‘Where shall we go?’ was of course the question, and it was warmly discussed. Anthea wanted to go to Japan. Robert and Cyril voted for America, and Jane wished to go to the seaside. ‘Because there are donkeys there,’ said she. ‘Not in November, silly,’ said Cyril; and the discussion got warmer and warmer, and still nothing was settled. ‘I vote we let the Phoenix decide,’ said Robert, at last. So they stroked it till it woke. ‘We want to go somewhere abroad,’ they said, ‘and we can’t make up our minds where.’ ‘Let the carpet make up ITS mind, if it has one,’ said the Phoenix. ‘Just say you wish to go abroad.’ So they did; and the next moment the world seemed to spin upside down, and when it was right way up again and they were ungiddy enough to look about them, they were out of doors. Out of doors, this is a feeble way to express where they were. They were out of, out of the earth, or off it. In fact, they were floating steadily, safely, splendidly, in the crisp clear air, with the pale bright blue of the sky above them, and far down below the pale bright sun-diamonded waves of the sea. The carpet had stiffened itself somehow, so that it was square and firm like a raft, and it steered itself so beautifully and kept on its way so flat and fearless that no one was at all afraid of tumbling off. In front of them lay land. ‘The coast of France,’ said the Phoenix, waking up and pointing with its wing. ‘Where do you wish to go? I should always keep one wish, of course, for emergencies, otherwise you may get into an emergency from which you can’t emerge at all.’ But the children were far too deeply interested to listen. ‘I tell you what,’ said Cyril: ‘let’s let the thing go on and on, and when we see a place we really want to stop at, why, we’ll just stop. Isn’t this ripping?’ ‘It’s like trains,’ said Anthea, as they swept over the low-lying coast-line and held a steady course above orderly fields and straight roads bordered with poplar trees, ‘like express trains, only in trains you never can see anything because of grown-ups wanting the windows shut; and then they breathe on them, and it’s like ground glass, and nobody can see anything, and then they go to sleep.’ ‘It’s like tobogganing,’ said Robert, ‘so fast and smooth, only there’s no door-mat to stop short on, it goes on and on.’ ‘You darling Phoenix,’ said Jane, ‘it’s all your doing. Oh, look at that ducky little church and the women with flappy cappy things on their heads.’ ‘Don’t mention it,’ said the Phoenix, with sleepy politeness. ‘OH!’ said Cyril, summing up all the rapture that was in every heart. ‘Look at it all, look at it, and think of the Kentish Town Road!’ Every one looked and every one thought. And the glorious, gliding, smooth, steady rush went on, and they looked down on strange and beautiful things, and held their breath and let it go in deep sighs, and said ‘Oh!’ and ‘Ah!’ till it was long past dinner-time. It was Jane who suddenly said, ‘I wish we’d brought that jam tart and cold mutton with us. It would have been jolly to have a picnic in the air.’ The jam tart and cold mutton were, however, far away, sitting quietly in the larder of the house in Camden Town which the children were supposed to be keeping. A mouse was at that moment tasting the outside of the raspberry jam part of the tart (she had nibbled a sort of gulf, or bay, through the pastry edge) to see whether it was the sort of dinner she could ask her little mouse-husband to sit down to. She had had a very good dinner herself. It is an ill wind that blows nobody any good. ‘We’ll stop as soon as we see a nice place,’ said Anthea. ‘I’ve got threepence, and you boys have the fourpence each that your trams didn’t cost the other day, so we can buy things to eat. I expect the Phoenix can speak French.’ The carpet was sailing along over rocks and rivers and trees and towns and farms and fields. It reminded everybody of a certain time when all of them had had wings, and had flown up to the top of a church tower, and had had a feast there of chicken and tongue and new bread and soda-water. And this again reminded them how hungry they were. And just as they were all being reminded of this very strongly indeed, they saw ahead of them some ruined walls on a hill, and strong and upright, and really, to look at, as good as new, a great square tower. ‘The top of that’s just the exactly same size as the carpet,’ said Jane. ‘ I  think it would be good to go to the top of that, because then none of the Abby-what’s-its-names, I mean natives, would be able to take the carpet away even if they wanted to. And some of us could go out and get things to eat, buy them honestly, I mean, not take them out of larder windows.’ ‘I think it would be better if we went, ’ Anthea was beginning; but Jane suddenly clenched her hands. ‘I don’t see why I should never do anything I want, just because I’m the youngest. I wish the carpet would fit itself in at the top of that tower, so there!’ The carpet made a disconcerting bound, and next moment it was hovering above the square top of the tower. Then slowly and carefully it began to sink under them. It was like a lift going down with you at the Army and Navy Stores. ‘I don’t think we ought to wish things without all agreeing to them first,’ said Robert, huffishly. ‘Hullo! What on earth?’ For unexpectedly and greyly something was coming up all round the four sides of the carpet. It was as if a wall were being built by magic quickness. It was a foot high, it was two feet high, three, four, five. It was shutting out the light, more and more. Anthea looked up at the sky and the walls that now rose six feet above them. ‘We’re dropping into the tower,’ she screamed. ‘THERE WASN’T ANY TOP TO IT. So the carpet’s going to fit itself in at the bottom.’ Robert sprang to his feet. ‘We ought to have, Hullo! an owl’s nest.’ He put his knee on a jutting smooth piece of grey stone, and reached his hand into a deep window slit, broad to the inside of the tower, and narrowing like a funnel to the outside. ‘Look sharp!’ cried every one, but Robert did not look sharp enough. By the time he had drawn his hand out of the owl’s nest, there were no eggs there, the carpet had sunk eight feet below him. ‘Jump, you silly cuckoo!’ cried Cyril, with brotherly anxiety. But Robert couldn’t turn round all in a minute into a jumping position. He wriggled and twisted and got on to the broad ledge, and by the time he was ready to jump the walls of the tower had risen up thirty feet above the others, who were still sinking with the carpet, and Robert found himself in the embrasure of a window; alone, for even the owls were not at home that day. The wall was smoothish; there was no climbing up, and as for climbing down, Robert hid his face in his hands, and squirmed back and back from the giddy verge, until the back part of him was wedged quite tight in the narrowest part of the window slit. He was safe now, of course, but the outside part of his window was like a frame to a picture of part of the other side of the tower. It was very pretty, with moss growing between the stones and little shiny gems; but between him and it there was the width of the tower, and nothing in it but empty air. The situation was terrible. Robert saw in a flash that the carpet was likely to bring them into just the same sort of tight places that they used to get into with the wishes the Psammead granted them. And the others, imagine their feelings as the carpet sank slowly and steadily to the very bottom of the tower, leaving Robert clinging to the wall. Robert did not even try to imagine their feelings, he had quite enough to do with his own; but you can. As soon as the carpet came to a stop on the ground at the bottom of the inside of the tower it suddenly lost that raft-like stiffness which had been such a comfort during the journey from Camden Town to the topless tower, and spread itself limply over the loose stones and little earthy mounds at the bottom of the tower, just exactly like any ordinary carpet. Also it shrank suddenly, so that it seemed to draw away from under their feet, and they stepped quickly off the edges and stood on the firm ground, while the carpet drew itself in till it was its proper size, and no longer fitted exactly into the inside of the tower, but left quite a big space all round it. Then across the carpet they looked at each other, and then every chin was tilted up and every eye sought vainly to see where poor Robert had got to. Of course, they couldn’t see him. ‘I wish we hadn’t come,’ said Jane. ‘You always do,’ said Cyril, briefly. ‘Look here, we can’t leave Robert up there. I wish the carpet would fetch him down.’ The carpet seemed to awake from a dream and pull itself together. It stiffened itself briskly and floated up between the four walls of the tower. The children below craned their heads back, and nearly broke their necks in doing it. The carpet rose and rose. It hung poised darkly above them for an anxious moment or two; then it dropped down again, threw itself on the uneven floor of the tower, and as it did so it tumbled Robert out on the uneven floor of the tower. ‘Oh, glory!’ said Robert, ‘that was a squeak. You don’t know how I felt. I say, I’ve had about enough for a bit. Let’s wish ourselves at home again and have a go at that jam tart and mutton. We can go out again afterwards.’ ‘Righto!’ said every one, for the adventure had shaken the nerves of all. So they all got on to the carpet again, and said,  ‘I wish we were at home.’ And lo and behold, they were no more at home than before. The carpet never moved. The Phoenix had taken the opportunity to go to sleep. Anthea woke it up gently. ‘Look here,’ she said. ‘I’m looking,’ said the Phoenix. ‘We WISHED to be at home, and we’re still here,’ complained Jane. ‘No,’ said the Phoenix, looking about it at the high dark walls of the tower. ‘No; I quite see that.’ ‘But we wished to be at home,’ said Cyril. ‘No doubt,’ said the bird, politely. ‘And the carpet hasn’t moved an inch,’ said Robert. ‘No,’ said the Phoenix, ‘I see it hasn’t.’ ‘But I thought it was a wishing carpet?’ ‘So it is,’ said the Phoenix. ‘Then why, ?’ asked the children, altogether. ‘I did tell you, you know,’ said the Phoenix, ‘only you are so fond of listening to the music of your own voices. It is, indeed, the most lovely music to each of us, and therefore, ’ ‘You did tell us WHAT?’ interrupted an Exasperated. ‘Why, that the carpet only gives you three wishes a day and YOU’VE HAD THEM.’ There was a heartfelt silence. ‘Then how are we going to get home?’ said Cyril, at last. ‘I haven’t any idea,’ replied the Phoenix, kindly. ‘Can I fly out and get you any little thing?’ ‘How could you carry the money to pay for it?’ ‘It isn’t necessary. Birds always take what they want. It is not regarded as stealing, except in the case of magpies.’ The children were glad to find they had been right in supposing this to be the case, on the day when they had wings, and had enjoyed somebody else’s ripe plums. ‘Yes; let the Phoenix get us something to eat, anyway,’ Robert urged, ’ [‘If it will be so kind you mean,’ corrected Anthea, in a whisper); ‘if it will be so kind, and we can be thinking while it’s gone.’ So the Phoenix fluttered up through the grey space of the tower and vanished at the top, and it was not till it had quite gone that Jane said,  ‘Suppose it never comes back.’ It was not a pleasant thought, and though Anthea at once said, ‘Of course it will come back; I’m certain it’s a bird of its word,’ a further gloom was cast by the idea. For, curiously enough, there was no door to the tower, and all the windows were far, far too high to be reached by the most adventurous climber. It was cold, too, and Anthea shivered. ‘Yes,’ said Cyril, ‘it’s like being at the bottom of a well.’ The children waited in a sad and hungry silence, and got little stiff necks with holding their little heads back to look up the inside of the tall grey tower, to see if the Phoenix were coming. At last it came. It looked very big as it fluttered down between the walls, and as it neared them the children saw that its bigness was caused by a basket of boiled chestnuts which it carried in one claw. In the other it held a piece of bread. And in its beak was a very large pear. The pear was juicy, and as good as a very small drink. When the meal was over every one felt better, and the question of how to get home was discussed without any disagreeableness. But no one could think of any way out of the difficulty, or even out of the tower; for the Phoenix, though its beak and claws had fortunately been strong enough to carry food for them, was plainly not equal to flying through the air with four well-nourished children. ‘We must stay here, I suppose,’ said Robert at last, ‘and shout out every now and then, and some one will hear us and bring ropes and ladders, and rescue us like out of mines; and they’ll get up a subscription to send us home, like castaways.’ ‘Yes; but we shan’t be home before mother is, and then father’ll take away the carpet and say it’s dangerous or something,’ said Cyril. ‘I DO wish we hadn’t come,’ said Jane. And every one else said ‘Shut up,’ except Anthea, who suddenly awoke the Phoenix and said,  ‘Look here, I believe YOU can help us. Oh, I do wish you would!’ ‘I will help you as far as lies in my power,’ said the Phoenix, at once. ‘What is it you want now?’ ‘Why, we want to get home,’ said every one. ‘Oh,’ said the Phoenix. ‘Ah, hum! Yes. Home, you said? Meaning?’ ‘Where we live, where we slept last night, where the altar is that your egg was hatched on.’ ‘Oh, there!’ said the Phoenix. ‘Well, I’ll do my best.’ It fluttered on to the carpet and walked up and down for a few minutes in deep thought. Then it drew itself up proudly. ‘I CAN help you,’ it said. ‘I am almost sure I can help you. Unless I am grossly deceived I can help you. You won’t mind my leaving you for an hour or two?’ and without waiting for a reply it soared up through the dimness of the tower into the brightness above. ‘Now,’ said Cyril, firmly, ‘it said an hour or two. But I’ve read about captives and people shut up in dungeons and catacombs and things awaiting release, and I know each moment is an eternity. Those people always do something to pass the desperate moments. It’s no use our trying to tame spiders, because we shan’t have time.’ ‘I HOPE not,’ said Jane, doubtfully. ‘But we ought to scratch our names on the stones or something.’ ‘I say, talking of stones,’ said Robert, ‘you see that heap of stones against the wall over in that corner. Well, I’m certain there’s a hole in the wall there, and I believe it’s a door. Yes, look here, the stones are round like an arch in the wall; and here’s the hole, it’s all black inside.’ He had walked over to the heap as he spoke and climbed up to it, dislodged the top stone of the heap and uncovered a little dark space. Next moment every one was helping to pull down the heap of stones, and very soon every one threw off its jacket, for it was warm work. ‘It IS a door,’ said Cyril, wiping his face, ‘and not a bad thing either, if, ’ He was going to add ‘if anything happens to the Phoenix,’ but he didn’t for fear of frightening Jane. He was not an unkind boy when he had leisure to think of such things. The arched hole in the wall grew larger and larger. It was very, very black, even compared with the sort of twilight at the bottom of the tower; it grew larger because the children kept pulling off the stones and throwing them down into another heap. The stones must have been there a very long time, for they were covered with moss, and some of them were stuck together by it. So it was fairly hard work, as Robert pointed out. When the hole reached to about halfway between the top of the arch and the tower, Robert and Cyril let themselves down cautiously on the inside, and lit matches. How thankful they felt then that they had a sensible father, who did not forbid them to carry matches, as some boys’ fathers do. The father of Robert and Cyril only insisted on the matches being of the kind that strike only on the box. ‘It’s not a door, it’s a sort of tunnel,’ Robert cried to the girls, after the first match had flared up, flickered, and gone out. ‘Stand off, we’ll push some more stones down!’ They did, amid deep excitement. And now the stone heap was almost gone, and before them the girls saw the dark archway leading to unknown things. All doubts and fears as to getting home were forgotten in this thrilling moment. It was like Monte Cristo, it was like,  ‘I say,’ cried Anthea, suddenly, ‘come out! There’s always bad air in places that have been shut up. It makes your torches go out, and then you die. It’s called fire-damp, I believe. Come out, I tell you.’ The urgency of her tone actually brought the boys out, and then every one took up its jacket and fanned the dark arch with it, so as to make the air fresh inside. When Anthea thought the air inside ‘must be freshened by now,’ Cyril led the way into the arch. The girls followed, and Robert came last, because Jane refused to tail the procession lest ‘something’ should come in after her, and catch at her from behind. Cyril advanced cautiously, lighting match after match, and peering before him. ‘It’s a vaulting roof,’ he said, ‘and it’s all stone, all right, Panther, don’t keep pulling at my jacket! The air must be all right because of the matches, silly, and there are, look out, there are steps down.’ ‘Oh, don’t let’s go any farther,’ said Jane, in an agony of reluctance (a very painful thing, by the way, to be in). ‘I’m sure there are snakes, or dens of lions, or something. Do let’s go back, and come some other time, with candles, and bellows for the fire-damp.’ ‘Let me get in front of you, then,’ said the stern voice of Robert, from behind. ‘This is exactly the place for buried treasure, and I’m going on, anyway; you can stay behind if you like.’ And then, of course, Jane consented to go on. So, very slowly and carefully, the children went down the steps, there were seventeen of them, and at the bottom of the steps were more passages branching four ways, and a sort of low arch on the right-hand side made Cyril wonder what it could be, for it was too low to be the beginning of another passage. So he knelt down and lit a match, and stooping very low he peeped in. ‘There’s SOMETHING,’ he said, and reached out his hand. It touched something that felt more like a damp bag of marbles than anything else that Cyril had ever touched. ‘I believe it IS a buried treasure,’ he cried. And it was; for even as Anthea cried, ‘Oh, hurry up, Squirrel, fetch it out!’ Cyril pulled out a rotting canvas bag, about as big as the paper ones the greengrocer gives you with Barcelona nuts in for sixpence. ‘There’s more of it, a lot more,’ he said. As he pulled the rotten bag gave way, and the gold coins ran and span and jumped and bumped and chinked and clinked on the floor of the dark passage. I wonder what you would say if you suddenly came upon a buried treasure? What Cyril said was, ‘Oh, bother, I’ve burnt my fingers!’ and as he spoke he dropped the match. ‘AND IT WAS THE LAST!’ he added. There was a moment of desperate silence. Then Jane began to cry. ‘Don’t,’ said Anthea, ‘don’t, Pussy, you’ll exhaust the air if you cry. We can get out all right.’ ‘Yes,’ said Jane, through her sobs, ‘and find the Phoenix has come back and gone away again, because it thought we’d gone home some other way, and, Oh, I WISH we hadn’t come.’ Every one stood quite still, only Anthea cuddled Jane up to her and tried to wipe her eyes in the dark. ‘D-DON’T,’ said Jane; ‘that’s my EAR, I’m not crying with my ears.’ ‘Come, let’s get on out,’ said Robert; but that was not so easy, for no one could remember exactly which way they had come. It is very difficult to remember things in the dark, unless you have matches with you, and then of course it is quite different, even if you don’t strike one. Every one had come to agree with Jane’s constant wish, and despair was making the darkness blacker than ever, when quite suddenly the floor seemed to tip up, and a strong sensation of being in a whirling lift came upon every one. All eyes were closed, one’s eyes always are in the dark, don’t you think? When the whirling feeling stopped, Cyril said ‘Earthquakes!’ and they all opened their eyes. They were in their own dingy breakfast-room at home, and oh, how light and bright and safe and pleasant and altogether delightful it seemed after that dark underground tunnel! The carpet lay on the floor, looking as calm as though it had never been for an excursion in its life. On the mantelpiece stood the Phoenix, waiting with an air of modest yet sterling worth for the thanks of the children. ‘But how DID you do it?’ they asked, when every one had thanked the Phoenix again and again. ‘Oh, I just went and got a wish from your friend the Psammead.’ ‘But how DID you know where to find it?’ ‘I found that out from the carpet; these wishing creatures always know all about each other, they’re so clannish; like the Scots, you know, all related.’ ‘But, the carpet can’t talk, can it?’ ‘No.’ ‘Then how, ’ ‘How did I get the Psammead’s address? I tell you I got it from the carpet.’ ‘DID it speak then?’ ‘No,’ said the Phoenix, thoughtfully, ‘it didn’t speak, but I gathered my information from something in its manner. I was always a singularly observant bird.’ It was not till after the cold mutton and the jam tart, as well as the tea and bread-and-butter, that any one found time to regret the golden treasure which had been left scattered on the floor of the underground passage, and which, indeed, no one had thought of till now, since the moment when Cyril burnt his fingers at the flame of the last match. ‘What owls and goats we were!’ said Robert. ‘Look how we’ve always wanted treasure, and now, ’ ‘Never mind,’ said Anthea, trying as usual to make the best of it. ‘We’ll go back again and get it all, and then we’ll give everybody presents.’ More than a quarter of an hour passed most agreeably in arranging what presents should be given to whom, and, when the claims of generosity had been satisfied, the talk ran for fifty minutes on what they would buy for themselves. It was Cyril who broke in on Robert’s almost too technical account of the motor-car on which he meant to go to and from school,  ‘There!’ he said. ‘Dry up. It’s no good. We can’t ever go back. We don’t know where it is.’ ‘Don’t YOU know?’ Jane asked the Phoenix, wistfully. ‘Not in the least,’ the Phoenix replied, in a tone of amiable regret. ‘Then we’ve lost the treasure,’ said Cyril. And they had. ‘But we’ve got the carpet and the Phoenix,’ said Anthea. ‘Excuse me,’ said the bird, with an air of wounded dignity, ‘I do SO HATE to seem to interfere, but surely you MUST mean the Phoenix and the carpet?’ CHAPTER 3. THE QUEEN COOK It was on a Saturday that the children made their first glorious journey on the wishing carpet. Unless you are too young to read at all, you will know that the next day must have been Sunday. Sunday at 18, Camden Terrace, Camden Town, was always a very pretty day. Father always brought home flowers on Saturday, so that the breakfast-table was extra beautiful. In November, of course, the flowers were chrysanthemums, yellow and coppery coloured. Then there were always sausages on toast for breakfast, and these are rapture, after six days of Kentish Town Road eggs at fourteen a shilling. On this particular Sunday there were fowls for dinner, a kind of food that is generally kept for birthdays and grand occasions, and there was an angel pudding, when rice and milk and oranges and white icing do their best to make you happy. After dinner father was very sleepy indeed, because he had been working hard all the week; but he did not yield to the voice that said, ‘Go and have an hour’s rest.’ He nursed the Lamb, who had a horrid cough that cook said was whooping-cough as sure as eggs, and he said,  ‘Come along, kiddies; I’ve got a ripping book from the library, called The Golden Age, and I’ll read it to you.’ Mother settled herself on the drawing-room sofa, and said she could listen quite nicely with her eyes shut. The Lamb snugged into the ‘armchair corner’ of daddy’s arm, and the others got into a happy heap on the hearth-rug. At first, of course, there were too many feet and knees and shoulders and elbows, but real comfort was actually settling down on them, and the Phoenix and the carpet were put away on the back top shelf of their minds (beautiful things that could be taken out and played with later), when a surly solid knock came at the drawing-room door. It opened an angry inch, and the cook’s voice said, ‘Please, m’, may I speak to you a moment?’ Mother looked at father with a desperate expression. Then she put her pretty sparkly Sunday shoes down from the sofa, and stood up in them and sighed. ‘As good fish in the sea,’ said father, cheerfully, and it was not till much later that the children understood what he meant. Mother went out into the passage, which is called ‘the hall’, where the umbrella-stand is, and the picture of the ‘Monarch of the Glen’ in a yellow shining frame, with brown spots on the Monarch from the damp in the house before last, and there was cook, very red and damp in the face, and with a clean apron tied on all crooked over the dirty one that she had dished up those dear delightful chickens in. She stood there and she seemed to get redder and damper, and she twisted the corner of her apron round her fingers, and she said very shortly and fiercely,  ‘If you please ma’am, I should wish to leave at my day month.’ Mother leaned against the hatstand. The children could see her looking pale through the crack of the door, because she had been very kind to the cook, and had given her a holiday only the day before, and it seemed so very unkind of the cook to want to go like this, and on a Sunday too. ‘Why, what’s the matter?’ mother said. ‘It’s them children,’ the cook replied, and somehow the children all felt that they had known it from the first. They did not remember having done anything extra wrong, but it is so frightfully easy to displease a cook. ‘It’s them children: there’s that there new carpet in their room, covered thick with mud, both sides, beastly yellow mud, and sakes alive knows where they got it. And all that muck to clean up on a Sunday! It’s not my place, and it’s not my intentions, so I don’t deceive you, ma’am, and but for them limbs, which they is if ever there was, it’s not a bad place, though I says it, and I wouldn’t wish to leave, but, ’ ‘I’m very sorry,’ said mother, gently. ‘I will speak to the children. And you had better think it over, and if you REALLY wish to go, tell me to-morrow.’ Next day mother had a quiet talk with cook, and cook said she didn’t mind if she stayed on a bit, just to see. But meantime the question of the muddy carpet had been gone into thoroughly by father and mother. Jane’s candid explanation that the mud had come from the bottom of a foreign tower where there was buried treasure was received with such chilling disbelief that the others limited their defence to an expression of sorrow, and of a determination ‘not to do it again’. But father said (and mother agreed with him, because mothers have to agree with fathers, and not because it was her own idea) that children who coated a carpet on both sides with thick mud, and when they were asked for an explanation could only talk silly nonsense, that meant Jane’s truthful statement, were not fit to have a carpet at all, and, indeed, SHOULDN’T have one for a week! So the carpet was brushed (with tea-leaves, too) which was the only comfort Anthea could think of, and folded up and put away in the cupboard at the top of the stairs, and daddy put the key in his trousers pocket. ‘Till Saturday,’ said he. ‘Never mind,’ said Anthea, ‘we’ve got the Phoenix.’ But, as it happened, they hadn’t. The Phoenix was nowhere to be found, and everything had suddenly settled down from the rosy wild beauty of magic happenings to the common damp brownness of ordinary November life in Camden Town, and there was the nursery floor all bare boards in the middle and brown oilcloth round the outside, and the bareness and yellowness of the middle floor showed up the blackbeetles with terrible distinctness, when the poor things came out in the evening, as usual, to try to make friends with the children. But the children never would. The Sunday ended in gloom, which even junket for supper in the blue Dresden bowl could hardly lighten at all. Next day the Lamb’s cough was worse. It certainly seemed very whoopy, and the doctor came in his brougham carriage. Every one tried to bear up under the weight of the sorrow which it was to know that the wishing carpet was locked up and the Phoenix mislaid. A good deal of time was spent in looking for the Phoenix. ‘It’s a bird of its word,’ said Anthea. ‘I’m sure it’s not deserted us. But you know it had a most awfully long fly from wherever it was to near Rochester and back, and I expect the poor thing’s feeling tired out and wants rest. I am sure we may trust it.’ The others tried to feel sure of this, too, but it was hard. No one could be expected to feel very kindly towards the cook, since it was entirely through her making such a fuss about a little foreign mud that the carpet had been taken away. ‘She might have told us,’ said Jane, ‘and Panther and I would have cleaned it with tea-leaves.’ ‘She’s a cantankerous cat,’ said Robert. ‘I shan’t say what I think about her,’ said Anthea, primly, ‘because it would be evil speaking, lying, and slandering.’ ‘It’s not lying to say she’s a disagreeable pig, and a beastly blue-nosed Bozwoz,’ said Cyril, who had read The Eyes of Light, and intended to talk like Tony as soon as he could teach Robert to talk like Paul. And all the children, even Anthea, agreed that even if she wasn’t a blue-nosed Bozwoz, they wished cook had never been born. But I ask you to believe that they didn’t do all the things on purpose which so annoyed the cook during the following week, though I daresay the things would not have happened if the cook had been a favourite. This is a mystery. Explain it if you can. The things that had happened were as follows: Sunday., Discovery of foreign mud on both sides of the carpet. Monday., Liquorice put on to boil with aniseed balls in a saucepan. Anthea did this, because she thought it would be good for the Lamb’s cough. The whole thing forgotten, and bottom of saucepan burned out. It was the little saucepan lined with white that was kept for the baby’s milk. Tuesday., A dead mouse found in pantry. Fish-slice taken to dig grave with. By regrettable accident fish-slice broken. Defence: ‘The cook oughtn’t to keep dead mice in pantries.’ Wednesday., Chopped suet left on kitchen table. Robert added chopped soap, but he says he thought the suet was soap too. Thursday., Broke the kitchen window by falling against it during a perfectly fair game of bandits in the area. Friday., Stopped up grating of kitchen sink with putty and filled sink with water to make a lake to sail paper boats in. Went away and left the tap running. Kitchen hearthrug and cook’s shoes ruined. On Saturday the carpet was restored. There had been plenty of time during the week to decide where it should be asked to go when they did get it back. Mother had gone over to granny’s, and had not taken the Lamb because he had a bad cough, which, cook repeatedly said, was whooping-cough as sure as eggs is eggs. ‘But we’ll take him out, a ducky darling,’ said Anthea. ‘We’ll take him somewhere where you can’t have whooping-cough. Don’t be so silly, Robert. If he DOES talk about it no one’ll take any notice. He’s always talking about things he’s never seen.’ So they dressed the Lamb and themselves in out-of-doors clothes, and the Lamb chuckled and coughed, and laughed and coughed again, poor dear, and all the chairs and tables were moved off the carpet by the boys, while Jane nursed the Lamb, and Anthea rushed through the house in one last wild hunt for the missing Phoenix. ‘It’s no use waiting for it,’ she said, reappearing breathless in the breakfast-room. ‘But I know it hasn’t deserted us. It’s a bird of its word.’ ‘Quite so,’ said the gentle voice of the Phoenix from beneath the table. Every one fell on its knees and looked up, and there was the Phoenix perched on a crossbar of wood that ran across under the table, and had once supported a drawer, in the happy days before the drawer had been used as a boat, and its bottom unfortunately trodden out by Raggett’s Really Reliable School Boots on the feet of Robert. ‘I’ve been here all the time,’ said the Phoenix, yawning politely behind its claw. ‘If you wanted me you should have recited the ode of invocation; it’s seven thousand lines long, and written in very pure and beautiful Greek.’ ‘Couldn’t you tell it us in English?’ asked Anthea. ‘It’s rather long, isn’t it?’ said Jane, jumping the Lamb on her knee. ‘Couldn’t you make a short English version, like Tate and Brady?’ ‘Oh, come along, do,’ said Robert, holding out his hand. ‘Come along, good old Phoenix.’ ‘Good old BEAUTIFUL Phoenix,’ it corrected shyly. ‘Good old BEAUTIFUL Phoenix, then. Come along, come along,’ said Robert, impatiently, with his hand still held out. The Phoenix fluttered at once on to his wrist. ‘This amiable youth,’ it said to the others, ‘has miraculously been able to put the whole meaning of the seven thousand lines of Greek invocation into one English hexameter, a little misplaced some of the words, but,  ‘Oh, come along, come along, good old beautiful Phoenix!’ ‘Not perfect, I admit, but not bad for a boy of his age.’ ‘Well, now then,’ said Robert, stepping back on to the carpet with the golden Phoenix on his wrist. ‘You look like the king’s falconer,’ said Jane, sitting down on the carpet with the baby on her lap. Robert tried to go on looking like it. Cyril and Anthea stood on the carpet. ‘We shall have to get back before dinner,’ said Cyril, ‘or cook will blow the gaff.’ ‘She hasn’t sneaked since Sunday,’ said Anthea. ‘She, ’ Robert was beginning, when the door burst open and the cook, fierce and furious, came in like a whirlwind and stood on the corner of the carpet, with a broken basin in one hand and a threat in the other, which was clenched. ‘Look ‘ere!’ she cried, ‘my only basin; and what the powers am I to make the beefsteak and kidney pudding in that your ma ordered for your dinners? You don’t deserve no dinners, so yer don’t.’ ‘I’m awfully sorry, cook,’ said Anthea gently; ‘it was my fault, and I forgot to tell you about it. It got broken when we were telling our fortunes with melted lead, you know, and I meant to tell you.’ ‘Meant to tell me,’ replied the cook; she was red with anger, and really I don’t wonder, ‘meant to tell! Well,  I  mean to tell, too. I’ve held my tongue this week through, because the missus she said to me quiet like, “We mustn’t expect old heads on young shoulders,” but now I shan’t hold it no longer. There was the soap you put in our pudding, and me and Eliza never so much as breathed it to your ma, though well we might, and the saucepan, and the fish-slice, and, My gracious cats alive! what ‘ave you got that blessed child dressed up in his outdoors for?’ ‘We aren’t going to take him out,’ said Anthea; ‘at least, ’ She stopped short, for though they weren’t going to take him out in the Kentish Town Road, they certainly intended to take him elsewhere. But not at all where cook meant when she said ‘out’. This confused the truthful Anthea. ‘Out!’ said the cook, ‘that I’ll take care you don’t;’ and she snatched the Lamb from the lap of Jane, while Anthea and Robert caught her by the skirts and apron. ‘Look here,’ said Cyril, in stern desperation, ‘will you go away, and make your pudding in a pie-dish, or a flower-pot, or a hot-water can, or something?’ ‘Not me,’ said the cook, briefly; ‘and leave this precious poppet for you to give his deathercold to.’ ‘I warn you,’ said Cyril, solemnly. ‘Beware, ere yet it be too late.’ ‘Late yourself the little popsey-wopsey,’ said the cook, with angry tenderness. ‘They shan’t take it out, no more they shan’t. And, Where did you get that there yellow fowl?’ She pointed to the Phoenix. Even Anthea saw that unless the cook lost her situation the loss would be theirs. ‘I wish,’ she said suddenly, ‘we were on a sunny southern shore, where there can’t be any whooping-cough.’ She said it through the frightened howls of the Lamb, and the sturdy scoldings of the cook, and instantly the giddy-go-round-and-falling-lift feeling swept over the whole party, and the cook sat down flat on the carpet, holding the screaming Lamb tight to her stout print-covered self, and calling on St Bridget to help her. She was an Irishwoman. The moment the tipsy-topsy-turvy feeling stopped, the cook opened her eyes, gave one sounding screech and shut them again, and Anthea took the opportunity to get the desperately howling Lamb into her own arms. ‘It’s all right,’ she said; ‘own Panther’s got you. Look at the trees, and the sand, and the shells, and the great big tortoises. Oh DEAR, how hot it is!’ It certainly was; for the trusty carpet had laid itself out on a southern shore that was sunny and no mistake, as Robert remarked. The greenest of green slopes led up to glorious groves where palm-trees and all the tropical flowers and fruits that you read of in Westward Ho! and Fair Play were growing in rich profusion. Between the green, green slope and the blue, blue sea lay a stretch of sand that looked like a carpet of jewelled cloth of gold, for it was not greyish as our northern sand is, but yellow and changing, opal-coloured like sunshine and rainbows. And at the very moment when the wild, whirling, blinding, deafening, tumbling upside-downness of the carpet-moving stopped, the children had the happiness of seeing three large live turtles waddle down to the edge of the sea and disappear in the water. And it was hotter than you can possibly imagine, unless you think of ovens on a baking-day. Every one without an instant’s hesitation tore off its London-in-November outdoor clothes, and Anthea took off the Lamb’s highwayman blue coat and his three-cornered hat, and then his jersey, and then the Lamb himself suddenly slipped out of his little blue tight breeches and stood up happy and hot in his little white shirt. ‘I’m sure it’s much warmer than the seaside in the summer,’ said Anthea. ‘Mother always lets us go barefoot then.’ So the Lamb’s shoes and socks and gaiters came off, and he stood digging his happy naked pink toes into the golden smooth sand. ‘I’m a little white duck-dickie,’ said he, ‘a little white duck-dickie what swims,’ and splashed quacking into a sandy pool. ‘Let him,’ said Anthea; ‘it can’t hurt him. Oh, how hot it is!’ The cook suddenly opened her eyes and screamed, shut them, screamed again, opened her eyes once more and said,  ‘Why, drat my cats alive, what’s all this? It’s a dream, I expect. Well, it’s the best I ever dreamed. I’ll look it up in the dream-book to-morrow. Seaside and trees and a carpet to sit on. I never did!’ ‘Look here,’ said Cyril, ‘it isn’t a dream; it’s real.’ ‘Ho yes!’ said the cook; ‘they always says that in dreams.’ ‘It’s REAL, I tell you,’ Robert said, stamping his foot. ‘I’m not going to tell you how it’s done, because that’s our secret.’ He winked heavily at each of the others in turn. ‘But you wouldn’t go away and make that pudding, so we HAD to bring you, and I hope you like it.’ ‘I do that, and no mistake,’ said the cook unexpectedly; ‘and it being a dream it don’t matter what I say; and I WILL say, if it’s my last word, that of all the aggravating little varmints, ’ ‘Calm yourself, my good woman,’ said the Phoenix. ‘Good woman, indeed,’ said the cook; ‘good woman yourself’ Then she saw who it was that had spoken. ‘Well, if I ever,’ said she; ‘this is something like a dream! Yellow fowls a-talking and all! I’ve heard of such, but never did I think to see the day.’ ‘Well, then,’ said Cyril, impatiently, ‘sit here and see the day now. It’s a jolly fine day. Here, you others, a council!’ They walked along the shore till they were out of earshot of the cook, who still sat gazing about her with a happy, dreamy, vacant smile. ‘Look here,’ said Cyril, ‘we must roll the carpet up and hide it, so that we can get at it at any moment. The Lamb can be getting rid of his whooping-cough all the morning, and we can look about; and if the savages on this island are cannibals, we’ll hook it, and take her back. And if not, we’ll LEAVE HER HERE.’ ‘Is that being kind to servants and animals, like the clergyman said?’ asked Jane. ‘Nor she isn’t kind,’ retorted Cyril. ‘Well, anyway,’ said Anthea, ‘the safest thing is to leave the carpet there with her sitting on it. Perhaps it’ll be a lesson to her, and anyway, if she thinks it’s a dream it won’t matter what she says when she gets home.’ So the extra coats and hats and mufflers were piled on the carpet. Cyril shouldered the well and happy Lamb, the Phoenix perched on Robert’s wrist, and ‘the party of explorers prepared to enter the interior’. The grassy slope was smooth, but under the trees there were tangled creepers with bright, strange-shaped flowers, and it was not easy to walk. ‘We ought to have an explorer’s axe,’ said Robert. ‘I shall ask father to give me one for Christmas.’ There were curtains of creepers with scented blossoms hanging from the trees, and brilliant birds darted about quite close to their faces. ‘Now, tell me honestly,’ said the Phoenix, ‘are there any birds here handsomer than I am? Don’t be afraid of hurting my feelings, I’m a modest bird, I hope.’ ‘Not one of them,’ said Robert, with conviction, ‘is a patch upon you!’ ‘I was never a vain bird,’ said the Phoenix, ‘but I own that you confirm my own impression. I will take a flight.’ It circled in the air for a moment, and, returning to Robert’s wrist, went on, ‘There is a path to the left.’ And there was. So now the children went on through the wood more quickly and comfortably, the girls picking flowers and the Lamb inviting the ‘pretty dickies’ to observe that he himself was a ‘little white real-water-wet duck!’ And all this time he hadn’t whooping-coughed once. The path turned and twisted, and, always threading their way amid a tangle of flowers, the children suddenly passed a corner and found themselves in a forest clearing, where there were a lot of pointed huts, the huts, as they knew at once, of SAVAGES. The boldest heart beat more quickly. Suppose they WERE cannibals. It was a long way back to the carpet. ‘Hadn’t we better go back?’ said Jane. ‘Go NOW,’ she said, and her voice trembled a little. ‘Suppose they eat us.’ ‘Nonsense, Pussy,’ said Cyril, firmly. ‘Look, there’s a goat tied up. That shows they don’t eat PEOPLE.’ ‘Let’s go on and say we’re missionaries,’ Robert suggested. ‘I shouldn’t advise THAT,’ said the Phoenix, very earnestly. ‘Why not?’ ‘Well, for one thing, it isn’t true,’ replied the golden bird. It was while they stood hesitating on the edge of the clearing that a tall man suddenly came out of one of the huts. He had hardly any clothes, and his body all over was a dark and beautiful coppery colour, just like the chrysanthemums father had brought home on Saturday. In his hand he held a spear. The whites of his eyes and the white of his teeth were the only light things about him, except that where the sun shone on his shiny brown body it looked white, too. If you will look carefully at the next shiny savage you meet with next to nothing on, you will see at once, if the sun happens to be shining at the time, that I am right about this. The savage looked at the children. Concealment was impossible. He uttered a shout that was more like ‘Oo goggery bag-wag’ than anything else the children had ever heard, and at once brown coppery people leapt out of every hut, and swarmed like ants about the clearing. There was no time for discussion, and no one wanted to discuss anything, anyhow. Whether these coppery people were cannibals or not now seemed to matter very little. Without an instant’s hesitation the four children turned and ran back along the forest path; the only pause was Anthea’s. She stood back to let Cyril pass, because he was carrying the Lamb, who screamed with delight. (He had not whooping-coughed a single once since the carpet landed him on the island.) ‘Gee-up, Squirrel; gee-gee,’ he shouted, and Cyril did gee-up. The path was a shorter cut to the beach than the creeper-covered way by which they had come, and almost directly they saw through the trees the shining blue-and-gold-and-opal of sand and sea. ‘Stick to it,’ cried Cyril, breathlessly. They did stick to it; they tore down the sands, they could hear behind them as they ran the patter of feet which they knew, too well, were copper-coloured. The sands were golden and opal-coloured, and BARE. There were wreaths of tropic seaweed, there were rich tropic shells of the kind you would not buy in the Kentish Town Road under at least fifteen pence a pair. There were turtles basking lumpily on the water’s edge, but no cook, no clothes, and no carpet. ‘On, on! Into the sea!’ gasped Cyril. ‘They MUST hate water. I’ve, heard, savages always, dirty.’ Their feet were splashing in the warm shallows before his breathless words were ended. The calm baby-waves were easy to go through. It is warm work running for your life in the tropics, and the coolness of the water was delicious. They were up to their arm-pits now, and Jane was up to her chin. ‘Look!’ said the Phoenix. ‘What are they pointing at?’ The children turned; and there, a little to the west was a head, a head they knew, with a crooked cap upon it. It was the head of the cook. For some reason or other the savages had stopped at the water’s edge and were all talking at the top of their voices, and all were pointing copper-coloured fingers, stiff with interest and excitement, at the head of the cook. The children hurried towards her as quickly as the water would let them. ‘What on earth did you come out here for?’ Robert shouted; ‘and where on earth’s the carpet?’ ‘It’s not on earth, bless you,’ replied the cook, happily; ‘it’s UNDER ME, in the water. I got a bit warm setting there in the sun, and I just says, “I wish I was in a cold bath”, just like that, and next minute here I was! It’s all part of the dream.’ Every one at once saw how extremely fortunate it was that the carpet had had the sense to take the cook to the nearest and largest bath, the sea, and how terrible it would have been if the carpet had taken itself and her to the stuffy little bath-room of the house in Camden Town! ‘Excuse me,’ said the Phoenix’s soft voice, breaking in on the general sigh of relief, ‘but I think these brown people want your cook.’ ‘To, to eat?’ whispered Jane, as well as she could through the water which the plunging Lamb was dashing in her face with happy fat hands and feet. ‘Hardly,’ rejoined the bird. ‘Who wants cooks to EAT? Cooks are ENGAGED, not eaten. They wish to engage her.’ ‘How can you understand what they say?’ asked Cyril, doubtfully. ‘It’s as easy as kissing your claw,’ replied the bird. ‘I speak and understand ALL languages, even that of your cook, which is difficult and unpleasing. It’s quite easy, when you know how it’s done. It just comes to you. I should advise you to beach the carpet and land the cargo, the cook, I mean. You can take my word for it, the copper-coloured ones will not harm you now.’ It is impossible not to take the word of a Phoenix when it tells you to. So the children at once got hold of the corners of the carpet, and, pulling it from under the cook, towed it slowly in through the shallowing water, and at last spread it on the sand. The cook, who had followed, instantly sat down on it, and at once the copper-coloured natives, now strangely humble, formed a ring round the carpet, and fell on their faces on the rainbow-and-gold sand. The tallest savage spoke in this position, which must have been very awkward for him; and Jane noticed that it took him quite a long time to get the sand out of his mouth afterwards. ‘He says,’ the Phoenix remarked after some time, ‘that they wish to engage your cook permanently.’ ‘Without a character?’ asked Anthea, who had heard her mother speak of such things. ‘They do not wish to engage her as cook, but as queen; and queens need not have characters.’ There was a breathless pause. ‘WELL,’ said Cyril, ‘of all the choices! But there’s no accounting for tastes.’ Every one laughed at the idea of the cook’s being engaged as queen; they could not help it. ‘I do not advise laughter,’ warned the Phoenix, ruffling out his golden feathers, which were extremely wet. ‘And it’s not their own choice. It seems that there is an ancient prophecy of this copper-coloured tribe that a great queen should some day arise out of the sea with a white crown on her head, and, and, well, you see! There’s the crown!’ It pointed its claw at cook’s cap; and a very dirty cap it was, because it was the end of the week. ‘That’s the white crown,’ it said; ‘at least, it’s nearly white, very white indeed compared to the colour THEY are, and anyway, it’s quite white enough.’ Cyril addressed the cook. ‘Look here!’ said he, ‘these brown people want you to be their queen. They’re only savages, and they don’t know any better. Now would you really like to stay? or, if you’ll promise not to be so jolly aggravating at home, and not to tell any one a word about to-day, we’ll take you back to Camden Town.’ ‘No, you don’t,’ said the cook, in firm, undoubting tones. ‘I’ve always wanted to be the Queen, God bless her! and I always thought what a good one I should make; and now I’m going to. IF it’s only in a dream, it’s well worth while. And I don’t go back to that nasty underground kitchen, and me blamed for everything; that I don’t, not till the dream’s finished and I wake up with that nasty bell a rang-tanging in my ears, so I tell you.’ ‘Are you SURE,’ Anthea anxiously asked the Phoenix, ‘that she will be quite safe here?’ ‘She will find the nest of a queen a very precious and soft thing,’ said the bird, solemnly. ‘There, you hear,’ said Cyril. ‘You’re in for a precious soft thing, so mind you’re a good queen, cook. It’s more than you’d any right to expect, but long may you reign.’ Some of the cook’s copper-coloured subjects now advanced from the forest with long garlands of beautiful flowers, white and sweet-scented, and hung them respectfully round the neck of their new sovereign. ‘What! all them lovely bokays for me!’ exclaimed the enraptured cook. ‘Well, this here is something LIKE a dream, I must say.’ She sat up very straight on the carpet, and the copper-coloured ones, themselves wreathed in garlands of the gayest flowers, madly stuck parrot feathers in their hair and began to dance. It was a dance such as you have never seen; it made the children feel almost sure that the cook was right, and that they were all in a dream. Small, strange-shaped drums were beaten, odd-sounding songs were sung, and the dance got faster and faster and odder and odder, till at last all the dancers fell on the sand tired out. The new queen, with her white crown-cap all on one side, clapped wildly. ‘Brayvo!’ she cried, ‘brayvo! It’s better than the Albert Edward Music-hall in the Kentish Town Road. Go it again!’ But the Phoenix would not translate this request into the copper-coloured language; and when the savages had recovered their breath, they implored their queen to leave her white escort and come with them to their huts. ‘The finest shall be yours, O queen,’ said they. ‘Well, so long!’ said the cook, getting heavily on to her feet, when the Phoenix had translated this request. ‘No more kitchens and attics for me, thank you. I’m off to my royal palace, I am; and I only wish this here dream would keep on for ever and ever.’ She picked up the ends of the garlands that trailed round her feet, and the children had one last glimpse of her striped stockings and worn elastic-side boots before she disappeared into the shadow of the forest, surrounded by her dusky retainers, singing songs of rejoicing as they went. ‘WELL!’ said Cyril, ‘I suppose she’s all right, but they don’t seem to count us for much, one way or the other.’ ‘Oh,’ said the Phoenix, ‘they think you’re merely dreams. The prophecy said that the queen would arise from the waves with a white crown and surrounded by white dream-children. That’s about what they think YOU are!’ ‘And what about dinner?’ said Robert, abruptly. ‘There won’t be any dinner, with no cook and no pudding-basin,’ Anthea reminded him; ‘but there’s always bread-and-butter.’ ‘Let’s get home,’ said Cyril. The Lamb was furiously unwishful to be dressed in his warm clothes again, but Anthea and Jane managed it, by force disguised as coaxing, and he never once whooping-coughed. Then every one put on its own warm things and took its place on the carpet. A sound of uncouth singing still came from beyond the trees where the copper-coloured natives were crooning songs of admiration and respect to their white-crowned queen. Then Anthea said ‘Home,’ just as duchesses and other people do to their coachmen, and the intelligent carpet in one whirling moment laid itself down in its proper place on the nursery floor. And at that very moment Eliza opened the door and said,  ‘Cook’s gone! I can’t find her anywhere, and there’s no dinner ready. She hasn’t taken her box nor yet her outdoor things. She just ran out to see the time, I shouldn’t wonder, the kitchen clock never did give her satisfaction, and she’s got run over or fell down in a fit as likely as not. You’ll have to put up with the cold bacon for your dinners; and what on earth you’ve got your outdoor things on for I don’t know. And then I’ll slip out and see if they know anything about her at the police-station.’ But nobody ever knew anything about the cook any more, except the children, and, later, one other person. Mother was so upset at losing the cook, and so anxious about her, that Anthea felt most miserable, as though she had done something very wrong indeed. She woke several times in the night, and at last decided that she would ask the Phoenix to let her tell her mother all about it. But there was no opportunity to do this next day, because the Phoenix, as usual, had gone to sleep in some out-of-the-way spot, after asking, as a special favour, not to be disturbed for twenty-four hours. The Lamb never whooping-coughed once all that Sunday, and mother and father said what good medicine it was that the doctor had given him. But the children knew that it was the southern shore where you can’t have whooping-cough that had cured him. The Lamb babbled of coloured sand and water, but no one took any notice of that. He often talked of things that hadn’t happened. It was on Monday morning, very early indeed, that Anthea woke and suddenly made up her mind. She crept downstairs in her night-gown (it was very chilly), sat down on the carpet, and with a beating heart wished herself on the sunny shore where you can’t have whooping-cough, and next moment there she was. The sand was splendidly warm. She could feel it at once, even through the carpet. She folded the carpet, and put it over her shoulders like a shawl, for she was determined not to be parted from it for a single instant, no matter how hot it might be to wear. Then trembling a little, and trying to keep up her courage by saying over and over, ‘It is my DUTY, it IS my duty,’ she went up the forest path. ‘Well, here you are again,’ said the cook, directly she saw Anthea. ‘This dream does keep on!’ The cook was dressed in a white robe; she had no shoes and stockings and no cap and she was sitting under a screen of palm-leaves, for it was afternoon in the island, and blazing hot. She wore a flower wreath on her hair, and copper-coloured boys were fanning her with peacock’s feathers. ‘They’ve got the cap put away,’ she said. ‘They seem to think a lot of it. Never saw one before, I expect.’ ‘Are you happy?’ asked Anthea, panting; the sight of the cook as queen quite took her breath away. ‘I believe you, my dear,’ said the cook, heartily. ‘Nothing to do unless you want to. But I’m getting rested now. Tomorrow I’m going to start cleaning out my hut, if the dream keeps on, and I shall teach them cooking; they burns everything to a cinder now unless they eats it raw.’ ‘But can you talk to them?’ ‘Lor’ love a duck, yes!’ the happy cook-queen replied; ‘it’s quite easy to pick up. I always thought I should be quick at foreign languages. I’ve taught them to understand “dinner,” and “I want a drink,” and “You leave me be,” already.’ ‘Then you don’t want anything?’ Anthea asked earnestly and anxiously. ‘Not me, miss; except if you’d only go away. I’m afraid of me waking up with that bell a-going if you keep on stopping here a-talking to me. Long as this here dream keeps up I’m as happy as a queen.’ ‘Goodbye, then,’ said Anthea, gaily, for her conscience was clear now. She hurried into the wood, threw herself on the ground, and said ‘Home’, and there she was, rolled in the carpet on the nursery floor. ‘SHE’S all right, anyhow,’ said Anthea, and went back to bed. ‘I’m glad somebody’s pleased. But mother will never believe me when I tell her.’ The story is indeed a little difficult to believe. Still, you might try. CHAPTER 4. TWO BAZAARS Mother was really a great dear. She was pretty and she was loving, and most frightfully good when you were ill, and always kind, and almost always just. That is, she was just when she understood things. But of course she did not always understand things. No one understands everything, and mothers are not angels, though a good many of them come pretty near it. The children knew that mother always WANTED to do what was best for them, even if she was not clever enough to know exactly what was the best. That was why all of them, but much more particularly Anthea, felt rather uncomfortable at keeping the great secret from her of the wishing carpet and the Phoenix. And Anthea, whose inside mind was made so that she was able to be much more uncomfortable than the others, had decided that she MUST tell her mother the truth, however little likely it was that her mother would believe it. ‘Then I shall have done what’s right,’ said she to the Phoenix; ‘and if she doesn’t believe me it won’t be my fault, will it?’ ‘Not in the least,’ said the golden bird. ‘And she won’t, so you’re quite safe.’ Anthea chose a time when she was doing her home-lessons, they were Algebra and Latin, German, English, and Euclid, and she asked her mother whether she might come and do them in the drawing-room, ‘so as to be quiet,’ she said to her mother; and to herself she said, ‘And that’s not the real reason. I hope I shan’t grow up a LIAR.’ Mother said, ‘Of course, dearie,’ and Anthea started swimming through a sea of x’s and y’s and z’s. Mother was sitting at the mahogany bureau writing letters. ‘Mother dear,’ said Anthea. ‘Yes, love-a-duck,’ said mother. ‘About cook,’ said Anthea. ‘ I  know where she is.’ ‘Do you, dear?’ said mother. ‘Well, I wouldn’t take her back after the way she has behaved.’ ‘It’s not her fault,’ said Anthea. ‘May I tell you about it from the beginning?’ Mother laid down her pen, and her nice face had a resigned expression. As you know, a resigned expression always makes you want not to tell anybody anything. ‘It’s like this,’ said Anthea, in a hurry: ‘that egg, you know, that came in the carpet; we put it in the fire and it hatched into the Phoenix, and the carpet was a wishing carpet, and, ’ ‘A very nice game, darling,’ said mother, taking up her pen. ‘Now do be quiet. I’ve got a lot of letters to write. I’m going to Bournemouth to-morrow with the Lamb, and there’s that bazaar.’ Anthea went back to x y z, and mother’s pen scratched busily. ‘But, mother,’ said Anthea, when mother put down the pen to lick an envelope, ‘the carpet takes us wherever we like, and, ’ ‘I wish it would take you where you could get a few nice Eastern things for my bazaar,’ said mother. ‘I promised them, and I’ve no time to go to Liberty’s now.’ ‘It shall,’ said Anthea, ‘but, mother, ’ ‘Well, dear,’ said mother, a little impatiently, for she had taken up her pen again. ‘The carpet took us to a place where you couldn’t have whooping-cough, and the Lamb hasn’t whooped since, and we took cook because she was so tiresome, and then she would stay and be queen of the savages. They thought her cap was a crown, and, ’ ‘Darling one,’ said mother, ‘you know I love to hear the things you make up, but I am most awfully busy.’ ‘But it’s true,’ said Anthea, desperately. ‘You shouldn’t say that, my sweet,’ said mother, gently. And then Anthea knew it was hopeless. ‘Are you going away for long?’ asked Anthea. ‘I’ve got a cold,’ said mother, ‘and daddy’s anxious about it, and the Lamb’s cough.’ ‘He hasn’t coughed since Saturday,’ the Lamb’s eldest sister interrupted. ‘I wish I could think so,’ mother replied. ‘And daddy’s got to go to Scotland. I do hope you’ll be good children.’ ‘We will, we will,’ said Anthea, fervently. ‘When’s the bazaar?’ ‘On Saturday,’ said mother, ‘at the schools. Oh, don’t talk any more, there’s a treasure! My head’s going round, and I’ve forgotten how to spell whooping-cough.’ Mother and the Lamb went away, and father went away, and there was a new cook who looked so like a frightened rabbit that no one had the heart to do anything to frighten her any more than seemed natural to her. The Phoenix begged to be excused. It said it wanted a week’s rest, and asked that it might not be disturbed. And it hid its golden gleaming self, and nobody could find it. So that when Wednesday afternoon brought an unexpected holiday, and every one decided to go somewhere on the carpet, the journey had to be undertaken without the Phoenix. They were debarred from any carpet excursions in the evening by a sudden promise to mother, exacted in the agitation of parting, that they would not be out after six at night, except on Saturday, when they were to go to the bazaar, and were pledged to put on their best clothes, to wash themselves to the uttermost, and to clean their nails, not with scissors, which are scratchy and bad, but with flat-sharpened ends of wooden matches, which do no harm to any one’s nails. ‘Let’s go and see the Lamb,’ said Jane. But every one was agreed that if they appeared suddenly in Bournemouth it would frighten mother out of her wits, if not into a fit. So they sat on the carpet, and thought and thought and thought till they almost began to squint. ‘Look here,’ said Cyril, ‘I know. Please carpet, take us somewhere where we can see the Lamb and mother and no one can see us.’ ‘Except the Lamb,’ said Jane, quickly. And the next moment they found themselves recovering from the upside-down movement, and there they were sitting on the carpet, and the carpet was laid out over another thick soft carpet of brown pine-needles. There were green pine-trees overhead, and a swift clear little stream was running as fast as ever it could between steep banks, and there, sitting on the pine-needle carpet, was mother, without her hat; and the sun was shining brightly, although it was November, and there was the Lamb, as jolly as jolly and not whooping at all. ‘The carpet’s deceived us,’ said Robert, gloomily; ‘mother will see us directly she turns her head.’ But the faithful carpet had not deceived them. Mother turned her dear head and looked straight at them, and DID NOT SEE THEM! ‘We’re invisible,’ Cyril whispered: ‘what awful larks!’ But to the girls it was not larks at all. It was horrible to have mother looking straight at them, and her face keeping the same, just as though they weren’t there. ‘I don’t like it,’ said Jane. ‘Mother never looked at us like that before. Just as if she didn’t love us, as if we were somebody else’s children, and not very nice ones either, as if she didn’t care whether she saw us or not.’ ‘It is horrid,’ said Anthea, almost in tears. But at this moment the Lamb saw them, and plunged towards the carpet, shrieking, ‘Panty, own Panty, an’ Pussy, an’ Squiggle, an’ Bobs, oh, oh!’ Anthea caught him and kissed him, so did Jane; they could not help it, he looked such a darling, with his blue three-cornered hat all on one side, and his precious face all dirty, quite in the old familiar way. ‘I love you, Panty; I love you, and you, and you, and you,’ cried the Lamb. It was a delicious moment. Even the boys thumped their baby brother joyously on the back. Then Anthea glanced at mother, and mother’s face was a pale sea-green colour, and she was staring at the Lamb as if she thought he had gone mad. And, indeed, that was exactly what she did think. ‘My Lamb, my precious! Come to mother,’ she cried, and jumped up and ran to the baby. She was so quick that the invisible children had to leap back, or she would have felt them; and to feel what you can’t see is the worst sort of ghost-feeling. Mother picked up the Lamb and hurried away from the pinewood. ‘Let’s go home,’ said Jane, after a miserable silence. ‘It feels just exactly as if mother didn’t love us.’ But they couldn’t bear to go home till they had seen mother meet another lady, and knew that she was safe. You cannot leave your mother to go green in the face in a distant pinewood, far from all human aid, and then go home on your wishing carpet as though nothing had happened. When mother seemed safe the children returned to the carpet, and said ‘Home’, and home they went. ‘I don’t care about being invisible myself,’ said Cyril, ‘at least, not with my own family. It would be different if you were a prince, or a bandit, or a burglar.’ And now the thoughts of all four dwelt fondly on the dear greenish face of mother. ‘I wish she hadn’t gone away,’ said Jane; ‘the house is simply beastly without her.’ ‘I think we ought to do what she said,’ Anthea put in. ‘I saw something in a book the other day about the wishes of the departed being sacred.’ ‘That means when they’ve departed farther off,’ said Cyril. ‘India’s coral or Greenland’s icy, don’t you know; not Bournemouth. Besides, we don’t know what her wishes are.’ ‘She SAID’, Anthea was very much inclined to cry, ‘she said, “Get Indian things for my bazaar;” but I know she thought we couldn’t, and it was only play.’ ‘Let’s get them all the same,’ said Robert. ‘We’ll go the first thing on Saturday morning.’ And on Saturday morning, the first thing, they went. There was no finding the Phoenix, so they sat on the beautiful wishing carpet, and said,  ‘We want Indian things for mother’s bazaar. Will you please take us where people will give us heaps of Indian things?’ The docile carpet swirled their senses away, and restored them on the outskirts of a gleaming white Indian town. They knew it was Indian at once, by the shape of the domes and roofs; and besides, a man went by on an elephant, and two English soldiers went along the road, talking like in Mr Kipling’s books, so after that no one could have any doubt as to where they were. They rolled up the carpet and Robert carried it, and they walked bodily into the town. It was very warm, and once more they had to take off their London-in-November coats, and carry them on their arms. The streets were narrow and strange, and the clothes of the people in the streets were stranger and the talk of the people was strangest of all. ‘I can’t understand a word,’ said Cyril. ‘How on earth are we to ask for things for our bazaar?’ ‘And they’re poor people, too,’ said Jane; ‘I’m sure they are. What we want is a rajah or something.’ Robert was beginning to unroll the carpet, but the others stopped him, imploring him not to waste a wish. ‘We asked the carpet to take us where we could get Indian things for bazaars,’ said Anthea, ‘and it will.’ Her faith was justified. Just as she finished speaking a very brown gentleman in a turban came up to them and bowed deeply. He spoke, and they thrilled to the sound of English words. ‘My ranee, she think you very nice childs. She asks do you lose yourselves, and do you desire to sell carpet? She see you from her palkee. You come see her, yes?’ They followed the stranger, who seemed to have a great many more teeth in his smile than are usual, and he led them through crooked streets to the ranee’s palace. I am not going to describe the ranee’s palace, because I really have never seen the palace of a ranee, and Mr Kipling has. So you can read about it in his books. But I know exactly what happened there. The old ranee sat on a low-cushioned seat, and there were a lot of other ladies with her, all in trousers and veils, and sparkling with tinsel and gold and jewels. And the brown, turbaned gentleman stood behind a sort of carved screen, and interpreted what the children said and what the queen said. And when the queen asked to buy the carpet, the children said ‘No.’ ‘Why?’ asked the ranee. And Jane briefly said why, and the interpreter interpreted. The queen spoke, and then the interpreter said,  ‘My mistress says it is a good story, and you tell it all through without thought of time.’ And they had to. It made a long story, especially as it had all to be told twice, once by Cyril and once by the interpreter. Cyril rather enjoyed himself. He warmed to his work, and told the tale of the Phoenix and the Carpet, and the Lone Tower, and the Queen-Cook, in language that grew insensibly more and more Arabian Nightsy, and the ranee and her ladies listened to the interpreter, and rolled about on their fat cushions with laughter. When the story was ended she spoke, and the interpreter explained that she had said, ‘Little one, thou art a heaven-born teller of tales,’ and she threw him a string of turquoises from round her neck. ‘OH, how lovely!’ cried Jane and Anthea. Cyril bowed several times, and then cleared his throat and said,  ‘Thank her very, very much; but I would much rather she gave me some of the cheap things in the bazaar. Tell her I want them to sell again, and give the money to buy clothes for poor people who haven’t any.’ ‘Tell him he has my leave to sell my gift and clothe the naked with its price,’ said the queen, when this was translated. But Cyril said very firmly, ‘No, thank you. The things have got to be sold to-day at our bazaar, and no one would buy a turquoise necklace at an English bazaar. They’d think it was sham, or else they’d want to know where we got it.’ So then the queen sent out for little pretty things, and her servants piled the carpet with them. ‘I must needs lend you an elephant to carry them away,’ she said, laughing. But Anthea said, ‘If the queen will lend us a comb and let us wash our hands and faces, she shall see a magic thing. We and the carpet and all these brass trays and pots and carved things and stuffs and things will just vanish away like smoke.’ The queen clapped her hands at this idea, and lent the children a sandal-wood comb inlaid with ivory lotus-flowers. And they washed their faces and hands in silver basins. Then Cyril made a very polite farewell speech, and quite suddenly he ended with the words,  ‘And I wish we were at the bazaar at our schools.’ And of course they were. And the queen and her ladies were left with their mouths open, gazing at the bare space on the inlaid marble floor where the carpet and the children had been. ‘That is magic, if ever magic was!’ said the queen, delighted with the incident; which, indeed, has given the ladies of that court something to talk about on wet days ever since. Cyril’s stories had taken some time, so had the meal of strange sweet foods that they had had while the little pretty things were being bought, and the gas in the schoolroom was already lighted. Outside, the winter dusk was stealing down among the Camden Town houses. ‘I’m glad we got washed in India,’ said Cyril. ‘We should have been awfully late if we’d had to go home and scrub.’ ‘Besides,’ Robert said, ‘it’s much warmer washing in India. I shouldn’t mind it so much if we lived there.’ The thoughtful carpet had dumped the children down in a dusky space behind the point where the corners of two stalls met. The floor was littered with string and brown paper, and baskets and boxes were heaped along the wall. The children crept out under a stall covered with all sorts of table-covers and mats and things, embroidered beautifully by idle ladies with no real work to do. They got out at the end, displacing a sideboard-cloth adorned with a tasteful pattern of blue geraniums. The girls got out unobserved, so did Cyril; but Robert, as he cautiously emerged, was actually walked on by Mrs Biddle, who kept the stall. Her large, solid foot stood firmly on the small, solid hand of Robert and who can blame Robert if he DID yell a little? A crowd instantly collected. Yells are very unusual at bazaars, and every one was intensely interested. It was several seconds before the three free children could make Mrs Biddle understand that what she was walking on was not a schoolroom floor, or even, as she presently supposed, a dropped pin-cushion, but the living hand of a suffering child. When she became aware that she really had hurt him, she grew very angry indeed. When people have hurt other people by accident, the one who does the hurting is always much the angriest. I wonder why. ‘I’m very sorry, I’m sure,’ said Mrs Biddle; but she spoke more in anger than in sorrow. ‘Come out! whatever do you mean by creeping about under the stalls, like earwigs?’ ‘We were looking at the things in the corner.’ ‘Such nasty, prying ways,’ said Mrs Biddle, ‘will never make you successful in life. There’s nothing there but packing and dust.’ ‘Oh, isn’t there!’ said Jane. ‘That’s all you know.’ ‘Little girl, don’t be rude,’ said Mrs Biddle, flushing violet. ‘She doesn’t mean to be; but there ARE some nice things there, all the same,’ said Cyril; who suddenly felt how impossible it was to inform the listening crowd that all the treasures piled on the carpet were mother’s contributions to the bazaar. No one would believe it; and if they did, and wrote to thank mother, she would think, well, goodness only knew what she would think. The other three children felt the same. ‘I should like to see them,’ said a very nice lady, whose friends had disappointed her, and who hoped that these might be belated contributions to her poorly furnished stall. She looked inquiringly at Robert, who said, ‘With pleasure, don’t mention it,’ and dived back under Mrs Biddle’s stall. ‘I wonder you encourage such behaviour,’ said Mrs Biddle. ‘I always speak my mind, as you know, Miss Peasmarsh; and, I must say, I am surprised.’ She turned to the crowd. ‘There is no entertainment here,’ she said sternly. ‘A very naughty little boy has accidentally hurt himself, but only slightly. Will you please disperse? It will only encourage him in naughtiness if he finds himself the centre of attraction.’ The crowd slowly dispersed. Anthea, speechless with fury, heard a nice curate say, ‘Poor little beggar!’ and loved the curate at once and for ever. Then Robert wriggled out from under the stall with some Benares brass and some inlaid sandalwood boxes. ‘Liberty!’ cried Miss Peasmarsh. ‘Then Charles has not forgotten, after all.’ ‘Excuse me,’ said Mrs Biddle, with fierce politeness, ‘these objects are deposited behind MY stall. Some unknown donor who does good by stealth, and would blush if he could hear you claim the things. Of course they are for me.’ ‘My stall touches yours at the corner,’ said poor Miss Peasmarsh, timidly, ‘and my cousin did promise, ’ The children sidled away from the unequal contest and mingled with the crowd. Their feelings were too deep for words, till at last Robert said,  ‘That stiff-starched PIG!’ ‘And after all our trouble! I’m hoarse with gassing to that trousered lady in India.’ ‘The pig-lady’s very, very nasty,’ said Jane. It was Anthea who said, in a hurried undertone, ‘She isn’t very nice, and Miss Peasmarsh is pretty and nice too. Who’s got a pencil?’ It was a long crawl, under three stalls, but Anthea did it. A large piece of pale blue paper lay among the rubbish in the corner. She folded it to a square and wrote upon it, licking the pencil at every word to make it mark quite blackly: ‘All these Indian things are for pretty, nice Miss Peasmarsh’s stall.’ She thought of adding, ‘There is nothing for Mrs Biddle;’ but she saw that this might lead to suspicion, so she wrote hastily: ‘From an unknown donna,’ and crept back among the boards and trestles to join the others. So that when Mrs Biddle appealed to the bazaar committee, and the corner of the stall was lifted and shifted, so that stout clergymen and heavy ladies could get to the corner without creeping under stalls, the blue paper was discovered, and all the splendid, shining Indian things were given over to Miss Peasmarsh, and she sold them all, and got thirty-five pounds for them. ‘I don’t understand about that blue paper,’ said Mrs Biddle. ‘It looks to me like the work of a lunatic. And saying you were nice and pretty! It’s not the work of a sane person.’ Anthea and Jane begged Miss Peasmarsh to let them help her to sell the things, because it was their brother who had announced the good news that the things had come. Miss Peasmarsh was very willing, for now her stall, that had been SO neglected, was surrounded by people who wanted to buy, and she was glad to be helped. The children noted that Mrs Biddle had not more to do in the way of selling than she could manage quite well. I hope they were not glad, for you should forgive your enemies, even if they walk on your hands and then say it is all your naughty fault. But I am afraid they were not so sorry as they ought to have been. It took some time to arrange the things on the stall. The carpet was spread over it, and the dark colours showed up the brass and silver and ivory things. It was a happy and busy afternoon, and when Miss Peasmarsh and the girls had sold every single one of the little pretty things from the Indian bazaar, far, far away, Anthea and Jane went off with the boys to fish in the fishpond, and dive into the bran-pie, and hear the cardboard band, and the phonograph, and the chorus of singing birds that was done behind a screen with glass tubes and glasses of water. They had a beautiful tea, suddenly presented to them by the nice curate, and Miss Peasmarsh joined them before they had had more than three cakes each. It was a merry party, and the curate was extremely pleasant to every one, ‘even to Miss Peasmarsh,’ as Jane said afterwards. ‘We ought to get back to the stall,’ said Anthea, when no one could possibly eat any more, and the curate was talking in a low voice to Miss Peas marsh about ‘after Easter’. ‘There’s nothing to go back for,’ said Miss Peasmarsh gaily; ‘thanks to you dear children we’ve sold everything.’ ‘There, there’s the carpet,’ said Cyril. ‘Oh,’ said Miss Peasmarsh, radiantly, ‘don’t bother about the carpet. I’ve sold even that. Mrs Biddle gave me ten shillings for it. She said it would do for her servant’s bedroom.’ ‘Why,’ said Jane, ‘her servants don’t HAVE carpets. We had cook from her, and she told us so.’ ‘No scandal about Queen Elizabeth, if YOU please,’ said the curate, cheerfully; and Miss Peasmarsh laughed, and looked at him as though she had never dreamed that any one COULD be so amusing. But the others were struck dumb. How could they say, ‘The carpet is ours!’ For who brings carpets to bazaars? The children were now thoroughly wretched. But I am glad to say that their wretchedness did not make them forget their manners, as it does sometimes, even with grown-up people, who ought to know ever so much better. They said, ‘Thank you very much for the jolly tea,’ and ‘Thanks for being so jolly,’ and ‘Thanks awfully for giving us such a jolly time;’ for the curate had stood fish-ponds, and bran-pies, and phonographs, and the chorus of singing birds, and had stood them like a man. The girls hugged Miss Peasmarsh, and as they went away they heard the curate say,  ‘Jolly little kids, yes, but what about, you will let it be directly after Easter. Ah, do say you will, ’ And Jane ran back and said, before Anthea could drag her away, ‘What are you going to do after Easter?’ Miss Peasmarsh smiled and looked very pretty indeed. And the curate said,  ‘I hope I am going to take a trip to the Fortunate Islands.’ ‘I wish we could take you on the wishing carpet,’ said Jane. ‘Thank you,’ said the curate, ‘but I’m afraid I can’t wait for that. I must go to the Fortunate Islands before they make me a bishop. I should have no time afterwards.’ ‘I’ve always thought I should marry a bishop,’ said Jane: ‘his aprons would come in so useful. Wouldn’t YOU like to marry a bishop, Miss Peasmarsh?’ It was then that they dragged her away. As it was Robert’s hand that Mrs Biddle had walked on, it was decided that he had better not recall the incident to her mind, and so make her angry again. Anthea and Jane had helped to sell things at the rival stall, so they were not likely to be popular. A hasty council of four decided that Mrs Biddle would hate Cyril less than she would hate the others, so the others mingled with the crowd, and it was he who said to her,  ‘Mrs Biddle, WE meant to have that carpet. Would you sell it to us? We would give you, ’ ‘Certainly not,’ said Mrs Biddle. ‘Go away, little boy.’ There was that in her tone which showed Cyril, all too plainly, the hopelessness of persuasion. He found the others and said,  ‘It’s no use; she’s like a lioness robbed of its puppies. We must watch where it goes, and, Anthea, I don’t care what you say. It’s our own carpet. It wouldn’t be burglary. It would be a sort of forlorn hope rescue party, heroic and daring and dashing, and not wrong at all.’ The children still wandered among the gay crowd, but there was no pleasure there for them any more. The chorus of singing birds sounded just like glass tubes being blown through water, and the phonograph simply made a horrid noise, so that you could hardly hear yourself speak. And the people were buying things they couldn’t possibly want, and it all seemed very stupid. And Mrs Biddle had bought the wishing carpet for ten shillings. And the whole of life was sad and grey and dusty, and smelt of slight gas escapes, and hot people, and cake and crumbs, and all the children were very tired indeed. They found a corner within sight of the carpet, and there they waited miserably, till it was far beyond their proper bedtime. And when it was ten the people who had bought things went away, but the people who had been selling stayed to count up their money. ‘And to jaw about it,’ said Robert. ‘I’ll never go to another bazaar as long as ever I live. My hand is swollen as big as a pudding. I expect the nails in her horrible boots were poisoned.’ Just then some one who seemed to have a right to interfere said,  ‘Everything is over now; you had better go home.’ So they went. And then they waited on the pavement under the gas lamp, where ragged children had been standing all the evening to listen to the band, and their feet slipped about in the greasy mud till Mrs Biddle came out and was driven away in a cab with the many things she hadn’t sold, and the few things she had bought, among others the carpet. The other stall-holders left their things at the school till Monday morning, but Mrs Biddle was afraid some one would steal some of them, so she took them in a cab. The children, now too desperate to care for mud or appearances, hung on behind the cab till it reached Mrs Biddle’s house. When she and the carpet had gone in and the door was shut Anthea said,  ‘Don’t let’s burgle, I mean do daring and dashing rescue acts, till we’ve given her a chance. Let’s ring and ask to see her.’ The others hated to do this, but at last they agreed, on condition that Anthea would not make any silly fuss about the burglary afterwards, if it really had to come to that. So they knocked and rang, and a scared-looking parlourmaid opened the front door. While they were asking for Mrs Biddle they saw her. She was in the dining-room, and she had already pushed back the table and spread out the carpet to see how it looked on the floor. ‘I knew she didn’t want it for her servants’ bedroom,’ Jane muttered. Anthea walked straight past the uncomfortable parlourmaid, and the others followed her. Mrs Biddle had her back to them, and was smoothing down the carpet with the same boot that had trampled on the hand of Robert. So that they were all in the room, and Cyril, with great presence of mind, had shut the room door before she saw them. ‘Who is it, Jane?’ she asked in a sour voice; and then turning suddenly, she saw who it was. Once more her face grew violet, a deep, dark violet. ‘You wicked daring little things!’ she cried, ‘how dare you come here? At this time of night, too. Be off, or I’ll send for the police.’ ‘Don’t be angry,’ said Anthea, soothingly, ‘we only wanted to ask you to let us have the carpet. We have quite twelve shillings between us, and, ’ ‘How DARE you?’ cried Mrs Biddle, and her voice shook with angriness. ‘You do look horrid,’ said Jane suddenly. Mrs Biddle actually stamped that booted foot of hers. ‘You rude, barefaced child!’ she said. Anthea almost shook Jane; but Jane pushed forward in spite of her. ‘It really IS our nursery carpet,’ she said, ‘you ask ANY ONE if it isn’t.’ ‘Let’s wish ourselves home,’ said Cyril in a whisper. ‘No go,’ Robert whispered back, ‘she’d be there too, and raving mad as likely as not. Horrid thing, I hate her!’ ‘I wish Mrs Biddle was in an angelic good temper,’ cried Anthea, suddenly. ‘It’s worth trying,’ she said to herself. Mrs Biddle’s face grew from purple to violet, and from violet to mauve, and from mauve to pink. Then she smiled quite a jolly smile. ‘Why, so I am!’ she said, ‘what a funny idea! Why shouldn’t I be in a good temper, my dears.’ Once more the carpet had done its work, and not on Mrs Biddle alone. The children felt suddenly good and happy. ‘You’re a jolly good sort,’ said Cyril. ‘I see that now. I’m sorry we vexed you at the bazaar to-day.’ ‘Not another word,’ said the changed Mrs Biddle. ‘Of course you shall have the carpet, my dears, if you’ve taken such a fancy to it. No, no; I won’t have more than the ten shillings I paid.’ ‘It does seem hard to ask you for it after you bought it at the bazaar,’ said Anthea; ‘but it really IS our nursery carpet. It got to the bazaar by mistake, with some other things.’ ‘Did it really, now? How vexing!’ said Mrs Biddle, kindly. ‘Well, my dears, I can very well give the extra ten shillings; so you take your carpet and we’ll say no more about it. Have a piece of cake before you go! I’m so sorry I stepped on your hand, my boy. Is it all right now?’ ‘Yes, thank you,’ said Robert. ‘I say, you ARE good.’ ‘Not at all,’ said Mrs Biddle, heartily. ‘I’m delighted to be able to give any little pleasure to you dear children.’ And she helped them to roll up the carpet, and the boys carried it away between them. ‘You ARE a dear,’ said Anthea, and she and Mrs Biddle kissed each other heartily. ‘WELL!’ said Cyril as they went along the street. ‘Yes,’ said Robert, ‘and the odd part is that you feel just as if it was REAL, her being so jolly, I mean, and not only the carpet making her nice.’ ‘Perhaps it IS real,’ said Anthea, ‘only it was covered up with crossness and tiredness and things, and the carpet took them away.’ ‘I hope it’ll keep them away,’ said Jane; ‘she isn’t ugly at all when she laughs.’ The carpet has done many wonders in its day; but the case of Mrs Biddle is, I think, the most wonderful. For from that day she was never anything like so disagreeable as she was before, and she sent a lovely silver tea-pot and a kind letter to Miss Peasmarsh when the pretty lady married the nice curate; just after Easter it was, and they went to Italy for their honeymoon. CHAPTER 5. THE TEMPLE ‘I wish we could find the Phoenix,’ said Jane. ‘It’s much better company than the carpet.’ ‘Beastly ungrateful, little kids are,’ said Cyril. ‘No, I’m not; only the carpet never says anything, and it’s so helpless. It doesn’t seem able to take care of itself. It gets sold, and taken into the sea, and things like that. You wouldn’t catch the Phoenix getting sold.’ It was two days after the bazaar. Every one was a little cross, some days are like that, usually Mondays, by the way. And this was a Monday. ‘I shouldn’t wonder if your precious Phoenix had gone off for good,’ said Cyril; ‘and I don’t know that I blame it. Look at the weather!’ ‘It’s not worth looking at,’ said Robert. And indeed it wasn’t. ‘The Phoenix hasn’t gone, I’m sure it hasn’t,’ said Anthea. ‘I’ll have another look for it.’ Anthea looked under tables and chairs, and in boxes and baskets, in mother’s work-bag and father’s portmanteau, but still the Phoenix showed not so much as the tip of one shining feather. Then suddenly Robert remembered how the whole of the Greek invocation song of seven thousand lines had been condensed by him into one English hexameter, so he stood on the carpet and chanted,    ‘Oh, come along, come along, you good old beautiful Phoenix,’ and almost at once there was a rustle of wings down the kitchen stairs, and the Phoenix sailed in on wide gold wings. ‘Where on earth HAVE you been?’ asked Anthea. ‘I’ve looked everywhere for you.’ ‘Not EVERYWHERE,’ replied the bird, ‘because you did not look in the place where I was. Confess that that hallowed spot was overlooked by you.’ ‘WHAT hallowed spot?’ asked Cyril, a little impatiently, for time was hastening on, and the wishing carpet still idle. ‘The spot,’ said the Phoenix, ‘which I hallowed by my golden presence was the Lutron.’ ‘The WHAT?’ ‘The bath, the place of washing.’ ‘I’m sure you weren’t,’ said Jane. ‘I looked there three times and moved all the towels.’ ‘I was concealed,’ said the Phoenix, ‘on the summit of a metal column, enchanted, I should judge, for it felt warm to my golden toes, as though the glorious sun of the desert shone ever upon it.’ ‘Oh, you mean the cylinder,’ said Cyril: ‘it HAS rather a comforting feel, this weather. And now where shall we go?’ And then, of course, the usual discussion broke out as to where they should go and what they should do. And naturally, every one wanted to do something that the others did not care about. ‘I am the eldest,’ Cyril remarked, ‘let’s go to the North Pole.’ ‘This weather! Likely!’ Robert rejoined. ‘Let’s go to the Equator.’ ‘I think the diamond mines of Golconda would be nice,’ said Anthea; ‘don’t you agree, Jane?’ ‘No, I don’t,’ retorted Jane, ‘I don’t agree with you. I don’t agree with anybody.’ The Phoenix raised a warning claw. ‘If you cannot agree among yourselves, I fear I shall have to leave you,’ it said. ‘Well, where shall we go? You decide!’ said all. ‘If I were you,’ said the bird, thoughtfully, ‘I should give the carpet a rest. Besides, you’ll lose the use of your legs if you go everywhere by carpet. Can’t you take me out and explain your ugly city to me?’ ‘We will if it clears up,’ said Robert, without enthusiasm. ‘Just look at the rain. And why should we give the carpet a rest?’ ‘Are you greedy and grasping, and heartless and selfish?’ asked the bird, sharply. ‘NO!’ said Robert, with indignation. ‘Well then!’ said the Phoenix. ‘And as to the rain, well, I am not fond of rain myself. If the sun knew  I  was here, he’s very fond of shining on me because I look so bright and golden. He always says I repay a little attention. Haven’t you some form of words suitable for use in wet weather?’ ‘There’s “Rain, rain, go away,”’ said Anthea; ‘but it never DOES go.’ ‘Perhaps you don’t say the invocation properly,’ said the bird.      ‘Rain, rain, go away,      Come again another day,      Little baby wants to play,’ said Anthea. ‘That’s quite wrong; and if you say it in that sort of dull way, I can quite understand the rain not taking any notice. You should open the window and shout as loud as you can,       ‘Rain, rain, go away,      Come again another day;      Now we want the sun, and so,      Pretty rain, be kind and go! ‘You should always speak politely to people when you want them to do things, and especially when it’s going away that you want them to do. And to-day you might add,       ‘Shine, great sun, the lovely Phoe-      Nix is here, and wants to be      Shone on, splendid sun, by thee!’ ‘That’s poetry!’ said Cyril, decidedly. ‘It’s like it,’ said the more cautious Robert. ‘I was obliged to put in “lovely”,’ said the Phoenix, modestly, ‘to make the line long enough.’ ‘There are plenty of nasty words just that length,’ said Jane; but every one else said ‘Hush!’ And then they opened the window and shouted the seven lines as loud as they could, and the Phoenix said all the words with them, except ‘lovely’, and when they came to that it looked down and coughed bashfully. The rain hesitated a moment and then went away. ‘There’s true politeness,’ said the Phoenix, and the next moment it was perched on the window-ledge, opening and shutting its radiant wings and flapping out its golden feathers in such a flood of glorious sunshine as you sometimes have at sunset in autumn time. People said afterwards that there had not been such sunshine in December for years and years and years. ‘And now,’ said the bird, ‘we will go out into the city, and you shall take me to see one of my temples.’ ‘Your temples?’ ‘I gather from the carpet that I have many temples in this land.’ ‘I don’t see how you CAN find anything out from it,’ said Jane: ‘it never speaks.’ ‘All the same, you can pick up things from a carpet,’ said the bird; ‘I’ve seen YOU do it. And I have picked up several pieces of information in this way. That papyrus on which you showed me my picture, I understand that it bears on it the name of the street of your city in which my finest temple stands, with my image graved in stone and in metal over against its portal.’ ‘You mean the fire insurance office,’ said Robert. ‘It’s not really a temple, and they don’t, ’ ‘Excuse me,’ said the Phoenix, coldly, ‘you are wholly misinformed. It IS a temple, and they do.’ ‘Don’t let’s waste the sunshine,’ said Anthea; ‘we might argue as we go along, to save time.’ So the Phoenix consented to make itself a nest in the breast of Robert’s Norfolk jacket, and they all went out into the splendid sunshine. The best way to the temple of the Phoenix seemed to be to take the tram, and on the top of it the children talked, while the Phoenix now and then put out a wary beak, cocked a cautious eye, and contradicted what the children were saying. It was a delicious ride, and the children felt how lucky they were to have had the money to pay for it. They went with the tram as far as it went, and when it did not go any farther they stopped too, and got off. The tram stops at the end of the Gray’s Inn Road, and it was Cyril who thought that one might well find a short cut to the Phoenix Office through the little streets and courts that lie tightly packed between Fetter Lane and Ludgate Circus. Of course, he was quite mistaken, as Robert told him at the time, and afterwards Robert did not forbear to remind his brother how he had said so. The streets there were small and stuffy and ugly, and crowded with printers’ boys and binders’ girls coming out from work; and these stared so hard at the pretty red coats and caps of the sisters that they wished they had gone some other way. And the printers and binders made very personal remarks, advising Jane to get her hair cut, and inquiring where Anthea had bought that hat. Jane and Anthea scorned to reply, and Cyril and Robert found that they were hardly a match for the rough crowd. They could think of nothing nasty enough to say. They turned a corner sharply, and then Anthea pulled Jane into an archway, and then inside a door; Cyril and Robert quickly followed, and the jeering crowd passed by without seein them. Anthea drew a long breath. ‘How awful!’ she said. ‘I didn’t know there were such people, except in books.’ ‘It was a bit thick; but it’s partly you girls’ fault, coming out in those flashy coats.’ ‘We thought we ought to, when we were going out with the Phoenix,’ said Jane; and the bird said, ‘Quite right, too’, and incautiously put out his head to give her a wink of encouragement. And at the same instant a dirty hand reached through the grim balustrade of the staircase beside them and clutched the Phoenix, and a hoarse voice said,  ‘I say, Urb, blowed if this ain’t our Poll parrot what we lost. Thank you very much, lidy, for bringin’ ‘im home to roost.’ The four turned swiftly. Two large and ragged boys were crouched amid the dark shadows of the stairs. They were much larger than Robert and Cyril, and one of them had snatched the Phoenix away and was holding it high above their heads. ‘Give me that bird,’ said Cyril, sternly: ‘it’s ours.’ ‘Good arternoon, and thankin’ you,’ the boy went on, with maddening mockery. ‘Sorry I can’t give yer tuppence for yer trouble, but I’ve ‘ad to spend my fortune advertising for my vallyable bird in all the newspapers. You can call for the reward next year.’ ‘Look out, Ike,’ said his friend, a little anxiously; ‘it ‘ave a beak on it.’ ‘It’s other parties as’ll have the Beak on to ‘em presently,’ said Ike, darkly, ‘if they come a-trying to lay claims on my Poll parrot. You just shut up, Urb. Now then, you four little gells, get out er this.’ ‘Little girls!’ cried Robert. ‘I’ll little girl you!’ He sprang up three stairs and hit out. There was a squawk, the most bird-like noise any one had ever heard from the Phoenix, and a fluttering, and a laugh in the darkness, and Ike said,  ‘There now, you’ve been and gone and strook my Poll parrot right in the fevvers, strook ‘im something crool, you ‘ave.’ Robert stamped with fury. Cyril felt himself growing pale with rage, and with the effort of screwing up his brain to make it clever enough to think of some way of being even with those boys. Anthea and Jane were as angry as the boys, but it made them want to cry. Yet it was Anthea who said,  ‘Do, PLEASE, let us have the bird.’ ‘Dew, PLEASE, get along and leave us an’ our bird alone.’ ‘If you don’t,’ said Anthea, ‘I shall fetch the police.’ ‘You better!’ said he who was named Urb. ‘Say, Ike, you twist the bloomin’ pigeon’s neck; he ain’t worth tuppence.’ ‘Oh, no,’ cried Jane, ‘don’t hurt it. Oh, don’t; it is such a pet.’ ‘I won’t hurt it,’ said Ike; ‘I’m ‘shamed of you, Urb, for to think of such a thing. Arf a shiner, miss, and the bird is yours for life.’ ‘Half a WHAT?’ asked Anthea. ‘Arf a shiner, quid, thick ‘un, half a sov, then.’ ‘I haven’t got it, and, besides, it’s OUR bird,’ said Anthea. ‘Oh, don’t talk to him,’ said Cyril and then Jane said suddenly,  ‘Phoenix, dear Phoenix, we can’t do anything. YOU must manage it.’ ‘With pleasure,’ said the Phoenix, and Ike nearly dropped it in his amazement. ‘I say, it do talk, suthin’ like,’ said he. ‘Youths,’ said the Phoenix, ‘sons of misfortune, hear my words.’ ‘My eyes!’ said Ike. ‘Look out, Ike,’ said Urb, ‘you’ll throttle the joker, and I see at wunst ‘e was wuth ‘is weight in flimsies.’00 ‘Hearken, O Eikonoclastes, despiser of sacred images, and thou, Urbanus, dweller in the sordid city. Forbear this adventure lest a worse thing befall.’ ‘Luv’ us!’ said Ike, ‘ain’t it been taught its schoolin’ just!’ ‘Restore me to my young acolytes and escape unscathed. Retain me, and, ’ ‘They must ha’ got all this up, case the Polly got pinched,’ said Ike. ‘Lor’ lumme, the artfulness of them young uns!’ ‘I say, slosh ‘em in the geseech and get clear off with the swag’s wot I say,’ urged Herbert. ‘Right O,’ said Isaac. ‘Forbear,’ repeated the Phoenix, sternly. ‘Who pinched the click off of the old bloke in Aldermanbury?’ it added, in a changed tone. ‘Who sneaked the nose-rag out of the young gell’s ‘and in Bell Court? Who, ’ ‘Stow it,’ said Ike. ‘You! ugh! yah!, leave go of me. Bash him off, Urb; ‘e’ll have my bloomin’ eyes outer my ed.’ There were howls, a scuffle, a flutter; Ike and Urb fled up the stairs, and the Phoenix swept out through the doorway. The children followed and the Phoenix settled on Robert, ‘like a butterfly on a rose,’ as Anthea said afterwards, and wriggled into the breast of his Norfolk jacket, ‘like an eel into mud,’ as Cyril later said. ‘Why ever didn’t you burn him? You could have, couldn’t you?’ asked Robert, when the hurried flight through the narrow courts had ended in the safe wideness of Farringdon Street. ‘I could have, of course,’ said the bird, ‘but I didn’t think it would be dignified to allow myself to get warm about a little thing like that. The Fates, after all, have not been illiberal to me. I have a good many friends among the London sparrows, and I have a beak and claws.’ These happenings had somewhat shaken the adventurous temper of the children, and the Phoenix had to exert its golden self to hearten them up. Presently the children came to a great house in Lombard Street, and there, on each side of the door, was the image of the Phoenix carved in stone, and set forth on shining brass were the words,       PHOENIX FIRE OFFICE ‘One moment,’ said the bird. ‘Fire? For altars, I suppose?’ ‘ I  don’t know,’ said Robert; he was beginning to feel shy, and that always made him rather cross. ‘Oh, yes, you do,’ Cyril contradicted. ‘When people’s houses are burnt down the Phoenix gives them new houses. Father told me; I asked him.’ ‘The house, then, like the Phoenix, rises from its ashes? Well have my priests dealt with the sons of men!’ ‘The sons of men pay, you know,’ said Anthea; ‘but it’s only a little every year.’ ‘That is to maintain my priests,’ said the bird, ‘who, in the hour of affliction, heal sorrows and rebuild houses. Lead on; inquire for the High Priest. I will not break upon them too suddenly in all my glory. Noble and honour-deserving are they who make as nought the evil deeds of the lame-footed and unpleasing Hephaestus.’ ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about, and I wish you wouldn’t muddle us with new names. Fire just happens. Nobody does it, not as a deed, you know,’ Cyril explained. ‘If they did the Phoenix wouldn’t help them, because its a crime to set fire to things. Arsenic, or something they call it, because it’s as bad as poisoning people. The Phoenix wouldn’t help THEM, father told me it wouldn’t.’ ‘My priests do well,’ said the Phoenix. ‘Lead on.’ ‘I don’t know what to say,’ said Cyril; and the Others said the same. ‘Ask for the High Priest,’ said the Phoenix. ‘Say that you have a secret to unfold that concerns my worship, and he will lead you to the innermost sanctuary.’ So the children went in, all four of them, though they didn’t like it, and stood in a large and beautiful hall adorned with Doulton tiles, like a large and beautiful bath with no water in it, and stately pillars supporting the roof. An unpleasing representation of the Phoenix in brown pottery disfigured one wall. There were counters and desks of mahogany and brass, and clerks bent over the desks and walked behind the counters. There was a great clock over an inner doorway. ‘Inquire for the High Priest,’ whispered the Phoenix. An attentive clerk in decent black, who controlled his mouth but not his eyebrows, now came towards them. He leaned forward on the counter, and the children thought he was going to say, ‘What can I have the pleasure of showing you?’ like in a draper’s; instead of which the young man said,  ‘And what do YOU want?’ ‘We want to see the High Priest.’ ‘Get along with you,’ said the young man. An elder man, also decent in black coat, advanced. ‘Perhaps it’s Mr Blank’ (not for worlds would I give the name). ‘He’s a Masonic High Priest, you know.’ A porter was sent away to look for Mr Asterisk (I cannot give his name), and the children were left there to look on and be looked on by all the gentlemen at the mahogany desks. Anthea and Jane thought that they looked kind. The boys thought they stared, and that it was like their cheek. The porter returned with the news that Mr Dot Dash Dot (I dare not reveal his name) was out, but that Mr,  Here a really delightful gentleman appeared. He had a beard and a kind and merry eye, and each one of the four knew at once that this was a man who had kiddies of his own and could understand what you were talking about. Yet it was a difficult thing to explain. ‘What is it?’ he asked. ‘Mr’, he named the name which I will never reveal, ‘is out. Can I do anything?’ ‘Inner sanctuary,’ murmured the Phoenix. ‘I beg your pardon,’ said the nice gentleman, who thought it was Robert who had spoken. ‘We have something to tell you,’ said Cyril, ‘but’, he glanced at the porter, who was lingering much nearer than he need have done, ‘this is a very public place.’ The nice gentleman laughed. ‘Come upstairs then,’ he said, and led the way up a wide and beautiful staircase. Anthea says the stairs were of white marble, but I am not sure. On the corner-post of the stairs, at the top, was a beautiful image of the Phoenix in dark metal, and on the wall at each side was a flat sort of image of it. The nice gentleman led them into a room where the chairs, and even the tables, were covered with reddish leather. He looked at the children inquiringly. ‘Don’t be frightened,’ he said; ‘tell me exactly what you want.’ ‘May I shut the door?’ asked Cyril. The gentleman looked surprised, but he shut the door. ‘Now,’ said Cyril, firmly, ‘I know you’ll be awfully surprised, and you’ll think it’s not true and we are lunatics; but we aren’t, and it is. Robert’s got something inside his Norfolk, that’s Robert, he’s my young brother. Now don’t be upset and have a fit or anything sir. Of course, I know when you called your shop the “Phoenix” you never thought there was one; but there is, and Robert’s got it buttoned up against his chest!’ ‘If it’s an old curio in the form of a Phoenix, I dare say the Board, ’ said the nice gentleman, as Robert began to fumble with his buttons. ‘It’s old enough,’ said Anthea, ‘going by what it says, but, ’ ‘My goodness gracious!’ said the gentleman, as the Phoenix, with one last wriggle that melted into a flutter, got out of its nest in the breast of Robert and stood up on the leather-covered table. ‘What an extraordinarily fine bird!’ he went on. ‘I don’t think I ever saw one just like it.’ ‘I should think not,’ said the Phoenix, with pardonable pride. And the gentleman jumped. ‘Oh, it’s been taught to speak! Some sort of parrot, perhaps?’ ‘I am,’ said the bird, simply, ‘the Head of your House, and I have come to my temple to receive your homage. I am no parrot’, its beak curved scornfully, ‘I am the one and only Phoenix, and I demand the homage of my High Priest.’ ‘In the absence of our manager,’ the gentleman began, exactly as though he were addressing a valued customer, ‘in the absence of our manager, I might perhaps be able, What am I saying?’ He turned pale, and passed his hand across his brow. ‘My dears,’ he said, ‘the weather is unusually warm for the time of year, and I don’t feel quite myself. Do you know, for a moment I really thought that that remarkable bird of yours had spoken and said it was the Phoenix, and, what’s more, that I’d believed it.’ ‘So it did, sir,’ said Cyril, ‘and so did you.’ ‘It really, Allow me.’ A bell was rung. The porter appeared. ‘Mackenzie,’ said the gentleman, ‘you see that golden bird?’ ‘Yes, sir.’ The other breathed a sigh of relief. ‘It IS real, then?’ ‘Yes, sir, of course, sir. You take it in your hand, sir,’ said the porter, sympathetically, and reached out his hand to the Phoenix, who shrank back on toes curved with agitated indignation. ‘Forbear!’ it cried; ‘how dare you seek to lay hands on me?’ The porter saluted. ‘Beg pardon, sir,’ he said, ‘I thought you was a bird.’ ‘I AM a bird, THE bird, the Phoenix.’ ‘Of course you are, sir,’ said the porter. ‘I see that the first minute, directly I got my breath, sir.’ ‘That will do,’ said the gentleman. ‘Ask Mr Wilson and Mr Sterry to step up here for a moment, please.’ Mr Sterry and Mr Wilson were in their turn overcome by amazement, quickly followed by conviction. To the surprise of the children every one in the office took the Phoenix at its word, and after the first shock of surprise it seemed to be perfectly natural to every one that the Phoenix should be alive, and that, passing through London, it should call at its temple. ‘We ought to have some sort of ceremony,’ said the nicest gentleman, anxiously. ‘There isn’t time to summon the directors and shareholders, we might do that tomorrow, perhaps. Yes, the board-room would be best. I shouldn’t like it to feel we hadn’t done everything in our power to show our appreciation of its condescension in looking in on us in this friendly way.’ The children could hardly believe their ears, for they had never thought that any one but themselves would believe in the Phoenix. And yet every one did; all the men in the office were brought in by twos and threes, and the moment the Phoenix opened its beak it convinced the cleverest of them, as well as those who were not so clever. Cyril wondered how the story would look in the papers next day. He seemed to see the posters in the streets:     PHOENIX FIRE OFFICE     THE PHOENIX AT ITS TEMPLE     MEETING TO WELCOME IT     DELIGHT OF THE MANAGER AND EVERYBODY. ‘Excuse our leaving you a moment,’ said the nice gentleman, and he went away with the others; and through the half-closed door the children could hear the sound of many boots on stairs, the hum of excited voices explaining, suggesting, arguing, the thumpy drag of heavy furniture being moved about. The Phoenix strutted up and down the leather-covered table, looking over its shoulder at its pretty back. ‘You see what a convincing manner I have,’ it said proudly. And now a new gentleman came in and said, bowing low,  ‘Everything is prepared, we have done our best at so short a notice; the meeting, the ceremony, will be in the board-room. Will the Honourable Phoenix walk, it is only a few steps, or would it like to be, would it like some sort of conveyance?’ ‘My Robert will bear me to the board-room, if that be the unlovely name of my temple’s inmost court,’ replied the bird. So they all followed the gentleman. There was a big table in the board-room, but it had been pushed right up under the long windows at one side, and chairs were arranged in rows across the room, like those you have at schools when there is a magic lantern on ‘Our Eastern Empire’, or on ‘The Way We Do in the Navy’. The doors were of carved wood, very beautiful, with a carved Phoenix above. Anthea noticed that the chairs in the front rows were of the kind that her mother so loved to ask the price of in old furniture shops, and never could buy, because the price was always nearly twenty pounds each. On the mantelpiece were some heavy bronze candlesticks and a clock, and on the top of the clock was another image of the Phoenix. ‘Remove that effigy,’ said the Phoenix to the gentlemen who were there, and it was hastily taken down. Then the Phoenix fluttered to the middle of the mantelpiece and stood there, looking more golden than ever. Then every one in the house and the office came in, from the cashier to the women who cooked the clerks’ dinners in the beautiful kitchen at the top of the house. And every one bowed to the Phoenix and then sat down in a chair. ‘Gentlemen,’ said the nicest gentleman, ‘we have met here today, ’ The Phoenix was turning its golden beak from side to side. ‘I don’t notice any incense,’ it said, with an injured sniff. A hurried consultation ended in plates being fetched from the kitchen. Brown sugar, sealing-wax, and tobacco were placed on these, and something from a square bottle was poured over it all. Then a match was applied. It was the only incense that was handy in the Phoenix office, and it certainly burned very briskly and smoked a great deal. ‘We have met here today,’ said the gentleman again, ‘on an occasion unparalleled in the annals of this office. Our respected Phoenix, ’ ‘Head of the House,’ said the Phoenix, in a hollow voice. ‘I was coming to that. Our respected Phoenix, the Head of this ancient House, has at length done us the honour to come among us. I think I may say, gentlemen, that we are not insensible to this honour, and that we welcome with no uncertain voice one whom we have so long desired to see in our midst.’ Several of the younger clerks thought of saying ‘Hear, hear,’ but they feared it might seem disrespectful to the bird. ‘I will not take up your time,’ the speaker went on, ‘by recapitulating the advantages to be derived from a proper use of our system of fire insurance. I know, and you know, gentlemen, that our aim has ever been to be worthy of that eminent bird whose name we bear, and who now adorns our mantelpiece with his presence. Three cheers, gentlemen, for the winged Head of the House!’ The cheers rose, deafening. When they had died away the Phoenix was asked to say a few words. It expressed in graceful phrases the pleasure it felt in finding itself at last in its own temple. ‘And,’ it went on, ‘You must not think me wanting in appreciation of your very hearty and cordial reception when I ask that an ode may be recited or a choric song sung. It is what I have always been accustomed to.’ The four children, dumb witnesses of this wonderful scene, glanced a little nervously across the foam of white faces above the sea of black coats. It seemed to them that the Phoenix was really asking a little too much. ‘Time presses,’ said the Phoenix, ‘and the original ode of invocation is long, as well as being Greek; and, besides, it’s no use invoking me when here I am; but is there not a song in your own tongue for a great day such as this?’ Absently the manager began to sing, and one by one the rest joined,       ‘Absolute security!      No liability!      All kinds of property      insured against fire.      Terms most favourable,      Expenses reasonable,      Moderate rates for annual      Insurance.’ ‘That one is NOT my favourite,’ interrupted the Phoenix, ‘and I think you’ve forgotten part of it.’ The manager hastily began another,       ‘O Golden Phoenix, fairest bird,      The whole great world has often heard      Of all the splendid things we do,      Great Phoenix, just to honour you.’ ‘That’s better,’ said the bird. And every one sang,       ‘Class one, for private dwelling-house,      For household goods and shops allows;      Provided these are built of brick      Or stone, and tiled and slated thick.’ ‘Try another verse,’ said the Phoenix, ‘further on.’ And again arose the voices of all the clerks and employees and managers and secretaries and cooks,      ‘In Scotland our insurance yields      The price of burnt-up stacks in fields.’ ‘Skip that verse,’ said the Phoenix.      ‘Thatched dwellings and their whole contents      We deal with, also with their rents;      Oh, glorious Phoenix, look and see      That these are dealt with in class three.      ‘The glories of your temple throng      Too thick to go in any song;      And we attend, O good and wise,      To “days of grace” and merchandise.      ‘When people’s homes are burned away      They never have a cent to pay      If they have done as all should do,      O Phoenix, and have honoured you.      ‘So let us raise our voice and sing      The praises of the Phoenix King.      In classes one and two and three,      Oh, trust to him, for kind is he!’ ‘I’m sure YOU’RE very kind,’ said the Phoenix; ‘and now we must be going. An thank you very much for a very pleasant time. May you all prosper as you deserve to do, for I am sure a nicer, pleasanter-spoken lot of temple attendants I have never met, and never wish to meet. I wish you all good-day!’ It fluttered to the wrist of Robert and drew the four children from the room. The whole of the office staff followed down the wide stairs and filed into their accustomed places, and the two most important officials stood on the steps bowing till Robert had buttoned the golden bird in his Norfolk bosom, and it and he and the three other children were lost in the crowd. The two most important gentlemen looked at each other earnestly and strangely for a moment, and then retreated to those sacred inner rooms, where they toil without ceasing for the good of the House. And the moment they were all in their places, managers, secretaries, clerks, and porters, they all started, and each looked cautiously round to see if any one was looking at him. For each thought that he had fallen asleep for a few minutes, and had dreamed a very odd dream about the Phoenix and the board-room. And, of course, no one mentioned it to any one else, because going to sleep at your office is a thing you simply MUST NOT do. The extraordinary confusion of the board-room, with the remains of the incense in the plates, would have shown them at once that the visit of the Phoenix had been no dream, but a radiant reality, but no one went into the board-room again that day; and next day, before the office was opened, it was all cleaned and put nice and tidy by a lady whose business asking questions was not part of. That is why Cyril read the papers in vain on the next day and the day after that; because no sensible person thinks his dreams worth putting in the paper, and no one will ever own that he has been asleep in the daytime. The Phoenix was very pleased, but it decided to write an ode for itself. It thought the ones it had heard at its temple had been too hastily composed. Its own ode began,       ‘For beauty and for modest worth      The Phoenix has not its equal on earth.’ And when the children went to bed that night it was still trying to cut down the last line to the proper length without taking out any of what it wanted to say. That is what makes poetry so difficult. CHAPTER 6. DOING GOOD ‘We shan’t be able to go anywhere on the carpet for a whole week, though,’ said Robert. ‘And I’m glad of it,’ said Jane, unexpectedly. ‘Glad?’ said Cyril; ‘GLAD?’ It was breakfast-time, and mother’s letter, telling them how they were all going for Christmas to their aunt’s at Lyndhurst, and how father and mother would meet them there, having been read by every one, lay on the table, drinking hot bacon-fat with one corner and eating marmalade with the other. ‘Yes, glad,’ said Jane. ‘I don’t want any more things to happen just now. I feel like you do when you’ve been to three parties in a week, like we did at granny’s once, and extras in between, toys and chocs and things like that. I want everything to be just real, and no fancy things happening at all.’ ‘I don’t like being obliged to keep things from mother,’ said Anthea. ‘I don’t know why, but it makes me feel selfish and mean.’ ‘If we could only get the mater to believe it, we might take her to the jolliest places,’ said Cyril, thoughtfully. ‘As it is, we’ve just got to be selfish and mean, if it is that, but I don’t feel it is.’ ‘I KNOW it isn’t, but I FEEL it is,’ said Anthea, ‘and that’s just as bad.’ ‘It’s worse,’ said Robert; ‘if you knew it and didn’t feel it, it wouldn’t matter so much.’ ‘That’s being a hardened criminal, father says,’ put in Cyril, and he picked up mother’s letter and wiped its corners with his handkerchief, to whose colour a trifle of bacon-fat and marmalade made but little difference. ‘We’re going to-morrow, anyhow,’ said Robert. ‘Don’t,’ he added, with a good-boy expression on his face, ‘don’t let’s be ungrateful for our blessings; don’t let’s waste the day in saying how horrid it is to keep secrets from mother, when we all know Anthea tried all she knew to give her the secret, and she wouldn’t take it. Let’s get on the carpet and have a jolly good wish. You’ll have time enough to repent of things all next week.’ ‘Yes,’ said Cyril, ‘let’s. It’s not really wrong.’ ‘Well, look here,’ said Anthea. ‘You know there’s something about Christmas that makes you want to be good, however little you wish it at other times. Couldn’t we wish the carpet to take us somewhere where we should have the chance to do some good and kind action? It would be an adventure just the same,’ she pleaded. ‘I don’t mind,’ said Cyril. ‘We shan’t know where we’re going, and that’ll be exciting. No one knows what’ll happen. We’d best put on our outers in case, ’ ‘We might rescue a traveller buried in the snow, like St Bernard dogs, with barrels round our necks,’ said Jane, beginning to be interested. ‘Or we might arrive just in time to witness a will being signed, more tea, please,’ said Robert, ‘and we should see the old man hide it away in the secret cupboard; and then, after long years, when the rightful heir was in despair, we should lead him to the hidden panel and, ’ ‘Yes,’ interrupted Anthea; ‘or we might be taken to some freezing garret in a German town, where a poor little pale, sick child, ’ ‘We haven’t any German money,’ interrupted Cyril, ‘so THAT’S no go. What I should like would be getting into the middle of a war and getting hold of secret intelligence and taking it to the general, and he would make me a lieutenant or a scout, or a hussar.’ When breakfast was cleared away, Anthea swept the carpet, and the children sat down on it, together with the Phoenix, who had been especially invited, as a Christmas treat, to come with them and witness the good and kind action they were about to do. Four children and one bird were ready, and the wish was wished. Every one closed its eyes, so as to feel the topsy-turvy swirl of the carpet’s movement as little as possible. When the eyes were opened again the children found themselves on the carpet, and the carpet was in its proper place on the floor of their own nursery at Camden Town. ‘I say,’ said Cyril, ‘here’s a go!’ ‘Do you think it’s worn out? The wishing part of it, I mean?’ Robert anxiously asked the Phoenix. ‘It’s not that,’ said the Phoenix; ‘but, well, what did you wish, ?’ ‘Oh! I see what it means,’ said Robert, with deep disgust; ‘it’s like the end of a fairy story in a Sunday magazine. How perfectly beastly!’ ‘You mean it means we can do kind and good actions where we are? I see. I suppose it wants us to carry coals for the cook or make clothes for the bare heathens. Well, I simply won’t. And the last day and everything. Look here!’ Cyril spoke loudly and firmly. ‘We want to go somewhere really interesting, where we have a chance of doing something good and kind; we don’t want to do it here, but somewhere else. See? Now, then.’ The obedient carpet started instantly, and the four children and one bird fell in a heap together, and as they fell were plunged in perfect darkness. ‘Are you all there?’ said Anthea, breathlessly, through the black dark. Every one owned that it was there. ‘Where are we? Oh! how shivery and wet it is! Ugh!, oh!, I’ve put my hand in a puddle!’ ‘Has any one got any matches?’ said Anthea, hopelessly. She felt sure that no one would have any. It was then that Robert, with a radiant smile of triumph that was quite wasted in the darkness, where, of course, no one could see anything, drew out of his pocket a box of matches, struck a match and lighted a candle, two candles. And every one, with its mouth open, blinked at the sudden light. ‘Well done Bobs,’ said his sisters, and even Cyril’s natural brotherly feelings could not check his admiration of Robert’s foresight. ‘I’ve always carried them about ever since the lone tower day,’ said Robert, with modest pride. ‘I knew we should want them some day. I kept the secret well, didn’t I?’ ‘Oh, yes,’ said Cyril, with fine scorn. ‘I found them the Sunday after, when I was feeling in your Norfolks for the knife you borrowed off me. But I thought you’d only sneaked them for Chinese lanterns, or reading in bed by.’ ‘Bobs,’ said Anthea, suddenly, ‘do you know where we are? This is the underground passage, and look there, there’s the money and the money-bags, and everything.’ By this time the ten eyes had got used to the light of the candles, and no one could help seeing that Anthea spoke the truth. ‘It seems an odd place to do good and kind acts in, though,’ said Jane. ‘There’s no one to do them to.’ ‘Don’t you be too sure,’ said Cyril; ‘just round the next turning we might find a prisoner who has languished here for years and years, and we could take him out on our carpet and restore him to his sorrowing friends.’ ‘Of course we could,’ said Robert, standing up and holding the candle above his head to see further off; ‘or we might find the bones of a poor prisoner and take them to his friends to be buried properly, that’s always a kind action in books, though I never could see what bones matter.’ ‘I wish you wouldn’t,’ said Jane. ‘I know exactly where we shall find the bones, too,’ Robert went on. ‘You see that dark arch just along the passage? Well, just inside there, ’ ‘If you don’t stop going on like that,’ said Jane, firmly, ‘I shall scream, and then I’ll faint, so now then!’ ‘And  I  will, too,’ said Anthea. Robert was not pleased at being checked in his flight of fancy. ‘You girls will never be great writers,’ he said bitterly. ‘They just love to think of things in dungeons, and chains, and knobbly bare human bones, and, ’ Jane had opened her mouth to scream, but before she could decide how you began when you wanted to faint, the golden voice of the Phoenix spoke through the gloom. ‘Peace!’ it said; ‘there are no bones here except the small but useful sets that you have inside you. And you did not invite me to come out with you to hear you talk about bones, but to see you do some good and kind action.’ ‘We can’t do it here,’ said Robert, sulkily. ‘No,’ rejoined the bird. ‘The only thing we can do here, it seems, is to try to frighten our little sisters.’ ‘He didn’t, really, and I’m not so VERY little,’ said Jane, rather ungratefully. Robert was silent. It was Cyril who suggested that perhaps they had better take the money and go. ‘That wouldn’t be a kind act, except to ourselves; and it wouldn’t be good, whatever way you look at it,’ said Anthea, ‘to take money that’s not ours.’ ‘We might take it and spend it all on benefits to the poor and aged,’ said Cyril. ‘That wouldn’t make it right to steal,’ said Anthea, stoutly. ‘I don’t know,’ said Cyril. They were all standing up now. ‘Stealing is taking things that belong to some one else, and there’s no one else.’ ‘It can’t be stealing if, ’ ‘That’s right,’ said Robert, with ironical approval; ‘stand here all day arguing while the candles burn out. You’ll like it awfully when it’s all dark again, and bony.’ ‘Let’s get out, then,’ said Anthea. ‘We can argue as we go.’ So they rolled up the carpet and went. But when they had crept along to the place where the passage led into the topless tower they found the way blocked by a great stone, which they could not move. ‘There!’ said Robert. ‘I hope you’re satisfied!’ ‘Everything has two ends,’ said the Phoenix, softly; ‘even a quarrel or a secret passage.’ So they turned round and went back, and Robert was made to go first with one of the candles, because he was the one who had begun to talk about bones. And Cyril carried the carpet. ‘I wish you hadn’t put bones into our heads,’ said Jane, as they went along. ‘I didn’t; you always had them. More bones than brains,’ said Robert. The passage was long, and there were arches and steps and turnings and dark alcoves that the girls did not much like passing. The passage ended in a flight of steps. Robert went up them. Suddenly he staggered heavily back on to the following feet of Jane, and everybody screamed, ‘Oh! what is it?’ ‘I’ve only bashed my head in,’ said Robert, when he had groaned for some time; ‘that’s all. Don’t mention it; I like it. The stairs just go right slap into the ceiling, and it’s a stone ceiling. You can’t do good and kind actions underneath a paving-stone.’ ‘Stairs aren’t made to lead just to paving-stones as a general rule,’ said the Phoenix. ‘Put your shoulder to the wheel.’ ‘There isn’t any wheel,’ said the injured Robert, still rubbing his head. But Cyril had pushed past him to the top stair, and was already shoving his hardest against the stone above. Of course, it did not give in the least. ‘If it’s a trap-door, ’ said Cyril. And he stopped shoving and began to feel about with his hands. ‘Yes, there is a bolt. I can’t move it.’ By a happy chance Cyril had in his pocket the oil-can of his father’s bicycle; he put the carpet down at the foot of the stairs, and he lay on his back, with his head on the top step and his feet straggling down among his young relations, and he oiled the bolt till the drops of rust and oil fell down on his face. One even went into his mouth, open, as he panted with the exertion of keeping up this unnatural position. Then he tried again, but still the bolt would not move. So now he tied his handkerchief, the one with the bacon-fat and marmalade on it, to the bolt, and Robert’s handkerchief to that, in a reef knot, which cannot come undone however much you pull, and, indeed, gets tighter and tighter the more you pull it. This must not be confused with a granny knot, which comes undone if you look at it. And then he and Robert pulled, and the girls put their arms round their brothers and pulled too, and suddenly the bolt gave way with a rusty scrunch, and they all rolled together to the bottom of the stairs, all but the Phoenix, which had taken to its wings when the pulling began. Nobody was hurt much, because the rolled-up carpet broke their fall; and now, indeed, the shoulders of the boys were used to some purpose, for the stone allowed them to heave it up. They felt it give; dust fell freely on them. ‘Now, then,’ cried Robert, forgetting his head and his temper, ‘push all together. One, two, three!’ The stone was heaved up. It swung up on a creaking, unwilling hinge, and showed a growing oblong of dazzling daylight; and it fell back with a bang against something that kept it upright. Every one climbed out, but there was not room for every one to stand comfortably in the little paved house where they found themselves, so when the Phoenix had fluttered up from the darkness they let the stone down, and it closed like a trap-door, as indeed it was. You can have no idea how dusty and dirty the children were. Fortunately there was no one to see them but each other. The place they were in was a little shrine, built on the side of a road that went winding up through yellow-green fields to the topless tower. Below them were fields and orchards, all bare boughs and brown furrows, and little houses and gardens. The shrine was a kind of tiny chapel with no front wall, just a place for people to stop and rest in and wish to be good. So the Phoenix told them. There was an image that had once been brightly coloured, but the rain and snow had beaten in through the open front of the shrine, and the poor image was dull and weather-stained. Under it was written: ‘St Jean de Luz. Priez pour nous.’ It was a sad little place, very neglected and lonely, and yet it was nice, Anthea thought, that poor travellers should come to this little rest-house in the hurry and worry of their journeyings and be quiet for a few minutes, and think about being good. The thought of St Jean de Luz, who had, no doubt, in his time, been very good and kind, made Anthea want more than ever to do something kind and good. ‘Tell us,’ she said to the Phoenix, ‘what is the good and kind action the carpet brought us here to do?’ ‘I think it would be kind to find the owners of the treasure and tell them about it,’ said Cyril. ‘And give it them ALL?’ said Jane. ‘Yes. But whose is it?’ ‘I should go to the first house and ask the name of the owner of the castle,’ said the golden bird, and really the idea seemed a good one. They dusted each other as well as they could and went down the road. A little way on they found a tiny spring, bubbling out of the hillside and falling into a rough stone basin surrounded by draggled hart’s-tongue ferns, now hardly green at all. Here the children washed their hands and faces and dried them on their pocket-handkerchiefs, which always, on these occasions, seem unnaturally small. Cyril’s and Robert’s handkerchiefs, indeed, rather undid the effects of the wash. But in spite of this the party certainly looked cleaner than before. The first house they came to was a little white house with green shutters and a slate roof. It stood in a prim little garden, and down each side of the neat path were large stone vases for flowers to grow in; but all the flowers were dead now. Along one side of the house was a sort of wide veranda, built of poles and trellis-work, and a vine crawled all over it. It was wider than our English verandas, and Anthea thought it must look lovely when the green leaves and the grapes were there; but now there were only dry, reddish-brown stalks and stems, with a few withered leaves caught in them. The children walked up to the front door. It was green and narrow. A chain with a handle hung beside it, and joined itself quite openly to a rusty bell that hung under the porch. Cyril had pulled the bell and its noisy clang was dying away before the terrible thought came to all. Cyril spoke it. ‘My hat!’ he breathed. ‘We don’t know any French!’ At this moment the door opened. A very tall, lean lady, with pale ringlets like whitey-brown paper or oak shavings, stood before them. She had an ugly grey dress and a black silk apron. Her eyes were small and grey and not pretty, and the rims were red, as though she had been crying. She addressed the party in something that sounded like a foreign language, and ended with something which they were sure was a question. Of course, no one could answer it. ‘What does she say?’ Robert asked, looking down into the hollow of his jacket, where the Phoenix was nestling. But before the Phoenix could answer, the whitey-brown lady’s face was lighted up by a most charming smile. ‘You, you ar-r-re fr-r-rom the England!’ she cried. ‘I love so much the England. Mais entrez, entrez donc tous! Enter, then, enter all. One essuyes his feet on the carpet.’ She pointed to the mat. ‘We only wanted to ask, ’ ‘I shall say you all that what you wish,’ said the lady. ‘Enter only!’ So they all went in, wiping their feet on a very clean mat, and putting the carpet in a safe corner of the veranda. ‘The most beautiful days of my life,’ said the lady, as she shut the door, ‘did pass themselves in England. And since long time I have not heard an English voice to repeal me the past.’ This warm welcome embarrassed every one, but most the boys, for the floor of the hall was of such very clean red and white tiles, and the floor of the sitting-room so very shiny, like a black looking-glass, that each felt as though he had on far more boots than usual, and far noisier. There was a wood fire, very small and very bright, on the hearth, neat little logs laid on brass fire-dogs. Some portraits of powdered ladies and gentlemen hung in oval frames on the pale walls. There were silver candlesticks on the mantelpiece, and there were chairs and a table, very slim and polite, with slender legs. The room was extremely bare, but with a bright foreign bareness that was very cheerful, in an odd way of its own. At the end of the polished table a very un-English little boy sat on a footstool in a high-backed, uncomfortable-looking chair. He wore black velvet, and the kind of collar, all frills and lacey, that Robert would rather have died than wear; but then the little French boy was much younger than Robert. ‘Oh, how pretty!’ said every one. But no one meant the little French boy, with the velvety short knickerbockers and the velvety short hair. What every one admired was a little, little Christmas-tree, very green, and standing in a very red little flower-pot, and hung round with very bright little things made of tinsel and coloured paper. There were tiny candles on the tree, but they were not lighted yet. ‘But yes, is it not that it is genteel?’ said the lady. ‘Sit down you then, and let us see.’ The children sat down in a row on the stiff chairs against the wall, and the lady lighted a long, slim red taper at the wood flame, and then she drew the curtains and lit the little candles, and when they were all lighted the little French boy suddenly shouted, ‘Bravo, ma tante! Oh, que c’est gentil,’ and the English children shouted ‘Hooray!’ Then there was a struggle in the breast of Robert, and out fluttered the Phoenix, spread his gold wings, flew to the top of the Christmas-tree, and perched there. ‘Ah! catch it, then,’ cried the lady; ‘it will itself burn, your genteel parrakeet!’ ‘It won’t,’ said Robert, ‘thank you.’ And the little French boy clapped his clean and tidy hands; but the lady was so anxious that the Phoenix fluttered down and walked up and down on the shiny walnut-wood table. ‘Is it that it talks?’ asked the lady. And the Phoenix replied in excellent French. It said, ‘Parfaitement, madame!’ ‘Oh, the pretty parrakeet,’ said the lady. ‘Can it say still of other things?’ And the Phoenix replied, this time in English, ‘Why are you sad so near Christmas-time?’ The children looked at it with one gasp of horror and surprise, for the youngest of them knew that it is far from manners to notice that strangers have been crying, and much worse to ask them the reason of their tears. And, of course, the lady began to cry again, very much indeed, after calling the Phoenix a bird without a heart; and she could not find her handkerchief, so Anthea offered hers, which was still very damp and no use at all. She also hugged the lady, and this seemed to be of more use than the handkerchief, so that presently the lady stopped crying, and found her own handkerchief and dried her eyes, and called Anthea a cherished angel. ‘I am sorry we came just when you were so sad,’ said Anthea, ‘but we really only wanted to ask you whose that castle is on the hill.’ ‘Oh, my little angel,’ said the poor lady, sniffing, ‘to-day and for hundreds of years the castle is to us, to our family. To-morrow it must that I sell it to some strangers, and my little Henri, who ignores all, he will not have never the lands paternal. But what will you? His father, my brother, Mr the Marquis, has spent much of money, and it the must, despite the sentiments of familial respect, that I admit that my sainted father he also, ’ ‘How would you feel if you found a lot of money, hundreds and thousands of gold pieces?’ asked Cyril. The lady smiled sadly. ‘Ah! one has already recounted to you the legend?’ she said. ‘It is true that one says that it is long time; oh! but long time, one of our ancestors has hid a treasure, of gold, and of gold, and of gold, enough to enrich my little Henri for the life. But all that, my children, it is but the accounts of fays, ’ ‘She means fairy stories,’ whispered the Phoenix to Robert. ‘Tell her what you have found.’ So Robert told, while Anthea and Jane hugged the lady for fear she should faint for joy, like people in books, and they hugged her with the earnest, joyous hugs of unselfish delight. ‘It’s no use explaining how we got in,’ said Robert, when he had told of the finding of the treasure, ‘because you would find it a little difficult to understand, and much more difficult to believe. But we can show you where the gold is and help you to fetch it away.’ The lady looked doubtfully at Robert as she absently returned the hugs of the girls. ‘No, he’s not making it up,’ said Anthea; ‘it’s true, TRUE, TRUE!, and we are so glad.’ ‘You would not be capable to torment an old woman?’ she said; ‘and it is not possible that it be a dream.’ ‘It really IS true,’ said Cyril; ‘and I congratulate you very much.’ His tone of studied politeness seemed to convince more than the raptures of the others. ‘If I do not dream,’ she said, ‘Henri come to Manon, and you, you shall come all with me to Mr the Curate. Is it not?’ Manon was a wrinkled old woman with a red and yellow handkerchief twisted round her head. She took Henri, who was already sleepy with the excitement of his Christmas-tree and his visitors, and when the lady had put on a stiff black cape and a wonderful black silk bonnet and a pair of black wooden clogs over her black cashmere house-boots, the whole party went down the road to a little white house, very like the one they had left, where an old priest, with a good face, welcomed them with a politeness so great that it hid his astonishment. The lady, with her French waving hands and her shrugging French shoulders and her trembling French speech, told the story. And now the priest, who knew no English, shrugged HIS shoulders and waved HIS hands and spoke also in French. ‘He thinks,’ whispered the Phoenix, ‘that her troubles have turned her brain. What a pity you know no French!’ ‘I do know a lot of French,’ whispered Robert, indignantly; ‘but it’s all about the pencil of the gardener’s son and the penknife of the baker’s niece, nothing that anyone ever wants to say.’ ‘If  I  speak,’ the bird whispered, ‘he’ll think HE’S mad, too.’ ‘Tell me what to say.’ ‘Say “C’est vrai, monsieur. Venez donc voir,”’ said the Phoenix; and then Robert earned the undying respect of everybody by suddenly saying, very loudly and distinctly,  ‘Say vray, mossoo; venny dong vwaw.’ The priest was disappointed when he found that Robert’s French began and ended with these useful words; but, at any rate, he saw that if the lady was mad she was not the only one, and he put on a big beavery hat, and got a candle and matches and a spade, and they all went up the hill to the wayside shrine of St John of Luz. ‘Now,’ said Robert, ‘I will go first and show you where it is.’ So they prised the stone up with a corner of the spade, and Robert did go first, and they all followed and found the golden treasure exactly as they had left it. And every one was flushed with the joy of performing such a wonderfully kind action. Then the lady and the priest clasped hands and wept for joy, as French people do, and knelt down and touched the money, and talked very fast and both together, and the lady embraced all the children three times each, and called them ‘little garden angels,’ and then she and the priest shook each other by both hands again, and talked, and talked, and talked, faster and more Frenchy than you would have believed possible. And the children were struck dumb with joy and pleasure. ‘Get away NOW,’ said the Phoenix softly, breaking in on the radiant dream. So the children crept away, and out through the little shrine, and the lady and the priest were so tearfully, talkatively happy that they never noticed that the guardian angels had gone. The ‘garden angels’ ran down the hill to the lady’s little house, where they had left the carpet on the veranda, and they spread it out and said ‘Home,’ and no one saw them disappear, except little Henri, who had flattened his nose into a white button against the window-glass, and when he tried to tell his aunt she thought he had been dreaming. So that was all right. ‘It is much the best thing we’ve done,’ said Anthea, when they talked it over at tea-time. ‘In the future we’ll only do kind actions with the carpet.’ ‘Ahem!’ said the Phoenix. ‘I beg your pardon?’ said Anthea. ‘Oh, nothing,’ said the bird. ‘I was only thinking!’ CHAPTER 7. MEWS FROM PERSIA When you hear that the four children found themselves at Waterloo Station quite un-taken-care-of, and with no one to meet them, it may make you think that their parents were neither kind nor careful. But if you think this you will be wrong. The fact is, mother arranged with Aunt Emma that she was to meet the children at Waterloo, when they went back from their Christmas holiday at Lyndhurst. The train was fixed, but not the day. Then mother wrote to Aunt Emma, giving her careful instructions about the day and the hour, and about luggage and cabs and things, and gave the letter to Robert to post. But the hounds happened to meet near Rufus Stone that morning, and what is more, on the way to the meet they met Robert, and Robert met them, and instantly forgot all about posting Aunt Emma’s letter, and never thought of it again until he and the others had wandered three times up and down the platform at Waterloo, which makes six in all, and had bumped against old gentlemen, and stared in the faces of ladies, and been shoved by people in a hurry, and ‘by-your-leaved’ by porters with trucks, and were quite, quite sure that Aunt Emma was not there. Then suddenly the true truth of what he had forgotten to do came home to Robert, and he said, ‘Oh, crikey!’ and stood still with his mouth open, and let a porter with a Gladstone bag in each hand and a bundle of umbrellas under one arm blunder heavily into him, and never so much as said, ‘Where are you shoving to now?’ or, ‘Look out where you’re going, can’t you?’ The heavier bag smote him at the knee, and he staggered, but he said nothing. When the others understood what was the matter I think they told Robert what they thought of him. ‘We must take the train to Croydon,’ said Anthea, ‘and find Aunt Emma.’ ‘Yes,’ said Cyril, ‘and precious pleased those Jevonses would be to see us and our traps.’ Aunt Emma, indeed, was staying with some Jevonses, very prim people. They were middle-aged and wore very smart blouses, and they were fond of matinees and shopping, and they did not care about children. ‘I know MOTHER would be pleased to see us if we went back,’ said Jane. ‘Yes, she would, but she’d think it was not right to show she was pleased, because it’s Bob’s fault we’re not met. Don’t I know the sort of thing?’ said Cyril. ‘Besides, we’ve no tin. No; we’ve got enough for a growler among us, but not enough for tickets to the New Forest. We must just go home. They won’t be so savage when they find we’ve really got home all right. You know auntie was only going to take us home in a cab.’ ‘I believe we ought to go to Croydon,’ Anthea insisted. ‘Aunt Emma would be out to a dead cert,’ said Robert. ‘Those Jevonses go to the theatre every afternoon, I believe. Besides, there’s the Phoenix at home, AND the carpet. I votes we call a four-wheeled cabman.’ A four-wheeled cabman was called, his cab was one of the old-fashioned kind with straw in the bottom, and he was asked by Anthea to drive them very carefully to their address. This he did, and the price he asked for doing so was exactly the value of the gold coin grandpapa had given Cyril for Christmas. This cast a gloom; but Cyril would never have stooped to argue about a cab-fare, for fear the cabman should think he was not accustomed to take cabs whenever he wanted them. For a reason that was something like this he told the cabman to put the luggage on the steps, and waited till the wheels of the growler had grittily retired before he rang the bell. ‘You see,’ he said, with his hand on the handle, ‘we don’t want cook and Eliza asking us before HIM how it is we’ve come home alone, as if we were babies.’ Here he rang the bell; and the moment its answering clang was heard, every one felt that it would be some time before that bell was answered. The sound of a bell is quite different, somehow, when there is anyone inside the house who hears it. I can’t tell you why that is, but so it is. ‘I expect they’re changing their dresses,’ said Jane. ‘Too late,’ said Anthea, ‘it must be past five. I expect Eliza’s gone to post a letter, and cook’s gone to see the time.’ Cyril rang again. And the bell did its best to inform the listening children that there was really no one human in the house. They rang again and listened intently. The hearts of all sank low. It is a terrible thing to be locked out of your own house, on a dark, muggy January evening. ‘There is no gas on anywhere,’ said Jane, in a broken voice. ‘I expect they’ve left the gas on once too often, and the draught blew it out, and they’re suffocated in their beds. Father always said they would some day,’ said Robert cheerfully. ‘Let’s go and fetch a policeman,’ said Anthea, trembling. ‘And be taken up for trying to be burglars, no, thank you,’ said Cyril. ‘I heard father read out of the paper about a young man who got into his own mother’s house, and they got him made a burglar only the other day.’ ‘I only hope the gas hasn’t hurt the Phoenix,’ said Anthea. ‘It said it wanted to stay in the bathroom cupboard, and I thought it would be all right, because the servants never clean that out. But if it’s gone and got out and been choked by gas, And besides, directly we open the door we shall be choked, too. I KNEW we ought to have gone to Aunt Emma, at Croydon. Oh, Squirrel, I wish we had. Let’s go NOW.’ ‘Shut up,’ said her brother, briefly. ‘There’s some one rattling the latch inside.’ Every one listened with all its ears, and every one stood back as far from the door as the steps would allow. The latch rattled, and clicked. Then the flap of the letter-box lifted itself, every one saw it by the flickering light of the gas-lamp that shone through the leafless lime-tree by the gate, a golden eye seemed to wink at them through the letter-slit, and a cautious beak whispered,  ‘Are you alone?’ ‘It’s the Phoenix,’ said every one, in a voice so joyous, and so full of relief, as to be a sort of whispered shout. ‘Hush!’ said the voice from the letter-box slit. ‘Your slaves have gone a-merry-making. The latch of this portal is too stiff for my beak. But at the side, the little window above the shelf whereon your bread lies, it is not fastened.’ ‘Righto!’ said Cyril. And Anthea added, ‘I wish you’d meet us there, dear Phoenix.’ The children crept round to the pantry window. It is at the side of the house, and there is a green gate labelled ‘Tradesmen’s Entrance’, which is always kept bolted. But if you get one foot on the fence between you and next door, and one on the handle of the gate, you are over before you know where you are. This, at least, was the experience of Cyril and Robert, and even, if the truth must be told, of Anthea and Jane. So in almost no time all four were in the narrow gravelled passage that runs between that house and the next. Then Robert made a back, and Cyril hoisted himself up and got his knicker-bockered knee on the concrete window-sill. He dived into the pantry head first, as one dives into water, and his legs waved in the air as he went, just as your legs do when you are first beginning to learn to dive. The soles of his boots, squarish muddy patches, disappeared. ‘Give me a leg up,’ said Robert to his sisters. ‘No, you don’t,’ said Jane firmly. ‘I’m not going to be left outside here with just Anthea, and have something creep up behind us out of the dark. Squirrel can go and open the back door.’ A light had sprung awake in the pantry. Cyril always said the Phoenix turned the gas on with its beak, and lighted it with a waft of its wing; but he was excited at the time, and perhaps he really did it himself with matches, and then forgot all about it. He let the others in by the back door. And when it had been bolted again the children went all over the house and lighted every single gas-jet they could find. For they couldn’t help feeling that this was just the dark dreary winter’s evening when an armed burglar might easily be expected to appear at any moment. There is nothing like light when you are afraid of burglars, or of anything else, for that matter. And when all the gas-jets were lighted it was quite clear that the Phoenix had made no mistake, and that Eliza and cook were really out, and that there was no one in the house except the four children, and the Phoenix, and the carpet, and the blackbeetles who lived in the cupboards on each side of the nursery fire-place. These last were very pleased that the children had come home again, especially when Anthea had lighted the nursery fire. But, as usual, the children treated the loving little blackbeetles with coldness and disdain. I wonder whether you know how to light a fire? I don’t mean how to strike a match and set fire to the corners of the paper in a fire someone has laid ready, but how to lay and light a fire all by yourself. I will tell you how Anthea did it, and if ever you have to light one yourself you may remember how it is done. First, she raked out the ashes of the fire that had burned there a week ago, for Eliza had actually never done this, though she had had plenty of time. In doing this Anthea knocked her knuckle and made it bleed. Then she laid the largest and handsomest cinders in the bottom of the grate. Then she took a sheet of old newspaper (you ought never to light a fire with to-day’s newspaper, it will not burn well, and there are other reasons against it), and tore it into four quarters, and screwed each of these into a loose ball, and put them on the cinders; then she got a bundle of wood and broke the string, and stuck the sticks in so that their front ends rested on the bars, and the back ends on the back of the paper balls. In doing this she cut her finger slightly with the string, and when she broke it, two of the sticks jumped up and hit her on the cheek. Then she put more cinders and some bits of coal, no dust. She put most of that on her hands, but there seemed to be enough left for her face. Then she lighted the edges of the paper balls, and waited till she heard the fizz-crack-crack-fizz of the wood as it began to burn. Then she went and washed her hands and face under the tap in the back kitchen. Of course, you need not bark your knuckles, or cut your finger, or bruise your cheek with wood, or black yourself all over; but otherwise, this is a very good way to light a fire in London. In the real country fires are lighted in a different and prettier way. But it is always good to wash your hands and face afterwards, wherever you are. While Anthea was delighting the poor little blackbeetles with the cheerful blaze, Jane had set the table for, I was going to say tea, but the meal of which I am speaking was not exactly tea. Let us call it a tea-ish meal. There was tea, certainly, for Anthea’s fire blazed and crackled so kindly that it really seemed to be affectionately inviting the kettle to come and sit upon its lap. So the kettle was brought and tea made. But no milk could be found, so every one had six lumps of sugar to each cup instead. The things to eat, on the other hand, were nicer than usual. The boys looked about very carefully, and found in the pantry some cold tongue, bread, butter, cheese, and part of a cold pudding, very much nicer than cook ever made when they were at home. And in the kitchen cupboard was half a Christmassy cake, a pot of strawberry jam, and about a pound of mixed candied fruit, with soft crumbly slabs of delicious sugar in each cup of lemon, orange, or citron. It was indeed, as Jane said, ‘a banquet fit for an Arabian Knight.’ The Phoenix perched on Robert’s chair, and listened kindly and politely to all they had to tell it about their visit to Lyndhurst, and underneath the table, by just stretching a toe down rather far, the faithful carpet could be felt by all, even by Jane, whose legs were very short. ‘Your slaves will not return to-night,’ said the Phoenix. ‘They sleep under the roof of the cook’s stepmother’s aunt, who is, I gather, hostess to a large party to-night in honour of her husband’s cousin’s sister-in-law’s mother’s ninetieth birthday.’ ‘I don’t think they ought to have gone without leave,’ said Anthea, ‘however many relations they have, or however old they are; but I suppose we ought to wash up.’ ‘It’s not our business about the leave,’ said Cyril, firmly, ‘but I simply won’t wash up for them. We got it, and we’ll clear it away; and then we’ll go somewhere on the carpet. It’s not often we get a chance of being out all night. We can go right away to the other side of the equator, to the tropical climes, and see the sun rise over the great Pacific Ocean.’ ‘Right you are,’ said Robert. ‘I always did want to see the Southern Cross and the stars as big as gas-lamps.’ ‘DON’T go,’ said Anthea, very earnestly, ‘because I COULDN’T. I’m SURE mother wouldn’t like us to leave the house and I should hate to be left here alone.’ ‘I’d stay with you,’ said Jane loyally. ‘I know you would,’ said Anthea gratefully, ‘but even with you I’d much rather not.’ ‘Well,’ said Cyril, trying to be kind and amiable, ‘I don’t want you to do anything you think’s wrong, BUT, ’ He was silent; this silence said many things. ‘I don’t see,’ Robert was beginning, when Anthea interrupted,  ‘I’m quite sure. Sometimes you just think a thing’s wrong, and sometimes you KNOW. And this is a KNOW time.’ The Phoenix turned kind golden eyes on her and opened a friendly beak to say,  ‘When it is, as you say, a “know time”, there is no more to be said. And your noble brothers would never leave you.’ ‘Of course not,’ said Cyril rather quickly. And Robert said so too. ‘I myself,’ the Phoenix went on, ‘am willing to help in any way possible. I will go personally, either by carpet or on the wing, and fetch you anything you can think of to amuse you during the evening. In order to waste no time I could go while you wash up., Why,’ it went on in a musing voice, ‘does one wash up teacups and wash down the stairs?’ ‘You couldn’t wash stairs up, you know,’ said Anthea, ‘unless you began at the bottom and went up feet first as you washed. I wish cook would try that way for a change.’ ‘I don’t,’ said Cyril, briefly. ‘I should hate the look of her elastic-side boots sticking up.’ ‘This is mere trifling,’ said the Phoenix. ‘Come, decide what I shall fetch for you. I can get you anything you like.’ But of course they couldn’t decide. Many things were suggested, a rocking-horse, jewelled chessmen, an elephant, a bicycle, a motor-car, books with pictures, musical instruments, and many other things. But a musical instrument is agreeable only to the player, unless he has learned to play it really well; books are not sociable, bicycles cannot be ridden without going out of doors, and the same is true of motor-cars and elephants. Only two people can play chess at once with one set of chessmen (and anyway it’s very much too much like lessons for a game), and only one can ride on a rocking-horse. Suddenly, in the midst of the discussion, the Phoenix spread its wings and fluttered to the floor, and from there it spoke. ‘I gather,’ it said, ‘from the carpet, that it wants you to let it go to its old home, where it was born and brought up, and it will return within the hour laden with a number of the most beautiful and delightful products of its native land.’ ‘What IS its native land?’ ‘I didn’t gather. But since you can’t agree, and time is passing, and the tea-things are not washed down, I mean washed up, ’ ‘I votes we do,’ said Robert. ‘It’ll stop all this jaw, anyway. And it’s not bad to have surprises. Perhaps it’s a Turkey carpet, and it might bring us Turkish delight.’ ‘Or a Turkish patrol,’ said Robert. ‘Or a Turkish bath,’ said Anthea. ‘Or a Turkish towel,’ said Jane. ‘Nonsense,’ Robert urged, ‘it said beautiful and delightful, and towels and baths aren’t THAT, however good they may be for you. Let it go. I suppose it won’t give us the slip,’ he added, pushing back his chair and standing up. ‘Hush!’ said the Phoenix; ‘how can you? Don’t trample on its feelings just because it’s only a carpet.’ ‘But how can it do it, unless one of us is on it to do the wishing?’ asked Robert. He spoke with a rising hope that it MIGHT be necessary for one to go and why not Robert? But the Phoenix quickly threw cold water on his new-born dream. ‘Why, you just write your wish on a paper, and pin it on the carpet.’ So a leaf was torn from Anthea’s arithmetic book, and on it Cyril wrote in large round-hand the following: We wish you to go to your dear native home, and bring back the most beautiful and delightful productions of it you can, and not to be gone long, please.                     (Signed)  CYRIL.                               ROBERT.                               ANTHEA.                               JANE. Then the paper was laid on the carpet. ‘Writing down, please,’ said the Phoenix; ‘the carpet can’t read a paper whose back is turned to it, any more than you can.’ It was pinned fast, and the table and chairs having been moved, the carpet simply and suddenly vanished, rather like a patch of water on a hearth under a fierce fire. The edges got smaller and smaller, and then it disappeared from sight. ‘It may take it some time to collect the beautiful and delightful things,’ said the Phoenix. ‘I should wash up, I mean wash down.’ So they did. There was plenty of hot water left in the kettle, and every one helped, even the Phoenix, who took up cups by their handles with its clever claws and dipped them in the hot water, and then stood them on the table ready for Anthea to dry them. But the bird was rather slow, because, as it said, though it was not above any sort of honest work, messing about with dish-water was not exactly what it had been brought up to. Everything was nicely washed up, and dried, and put in its proper place, and the dish-cloth washed and hung on the edge of the copper to dry, and the tea-cloth was hung on the line that goes across the scullery. (If you are a duchess’s child, or a king’s, or a person of high social position’s child, you will perhaps not know the difference between a dish-cloth and a tea-cloth; but in that case your nurse has been better instructed than you, and she will tell you all about it.) And just as eight hands and one pair of claws were being dried on the roller-towel behind the scullery door there came a strange sound from the other side of the kitchen wall, the side where the nursery was. It was a very strange sound, indeed, most odd, and unlike any other sounds the children had ever heard. At least, they had heard sounds as much like it as a toy engine’s whistle is like a steam siren’s. ‘The carpet’s come back,’ said Robert; and the others felt that he was right. ‘But what has it brought with it?’ asked Jane. ‘It sounds like Leviathan, that great beast.’ ‘It couldn’t have been made in India, and have brought elephants? Even baby ones would be rather awful in that room,’ said Cyril. ‘I vote we take it in turns to squint through the keyhole.’ They did, in the order of their ages. The Phoenix, being the eldest by some thousands of years, was entitled to the first peep. But,  ‘Excuse me,’ it said, ruffling its golden feathers and sneezing softly; ‘looking through keyholes always gives me a cold in my golden eyes.’ So Cyril looked. ‘I see something grey moving,’ said he. ‘It’s a zoological garden of some sort, I bet,’ said Robert, when he had taken his turn. And the soft rustling, bustling, ruffling, scuffling, shuffling, fluffling noise went on inside. ‘ I  can’t see anything,’ said Anthea, ‘my eye tickles so.’ Then Jane’s turn came, and she put her eye to the keyhole. ‘It’s a giant kitty-cat,’ she said; ‘and it’s asleep all over the floor.’ ‘Giant cats are tigers, father said so.’ ‘No, he didn’t. He said tigers were giant cats. It’s not at all the same thing.’ ‘It’s no use sending the carpet to fetch precious things for you if you’re afraid to look at them when they come,’ said the Phoenix, sensibly. And Cyril, being the eldest, said,  ‘Come on,’ and turned the handle. The gas had been left full on after tea, and everything in the room could be plainly seen by the ten eyes at the door. At least, not everything, for though the carpet was there it was invisible, because it was completely covered by the hundred and ninety-nine beautiful objects which it had brought from its birthplace. ‘My hat!’ Cyril remarked. ‘I never thought about its being a PERSIAN carpet.’ Yet it was now plain that it was so, for the beautiful objects which it had brought back were cats, Persian cats, grey Persian cats, and there were, as I have said, 199 of them, and they were sitting on the carpet as close as they could get to each other. But the moment the children entered the room the cats rose and stretched, and spread and overflowed from the carpet to the floor, and in an instant the floor was a sea of moving, mewing pussishness, and the children with one accord climbed to the table, and gathered up their legs, and the people next door knocked on the wall, and, indeed, no wonder, for the mews were Persian and piercing. ‘This is pretty poor sport,’ said Cyril. ‘What’s the matter with the bounders?’ ‘I imagine that they are hungry,’ said the Phoenix. ‘If you were to feed them, ’ ‘We haven’t anything to feed them with,’ said Anthea in despair, and she stroked the nearest Persian back. ‘Oh, pussies, do be quiet, we can’t hear ourselves think.’ She had to shout this entreaty, for the mews were growing deafening, ‘and it would take pounds’ and pounds’ worth of cat’s-meat.’ ‘Let’s ask the carpet to take them away,’ said Robert. But the girls said ‘No.’ ‘They are so soft and pussy,’ said Jane. ‘And valuable,’ said Anthea, hastily. ‘We can sell them for lots and lots of money.’ ‘Why not send the carpet to get food for them?’ suggested the Phoenix, and its golden voice came harsh and cracked with the effort it had to be make to be heard above the increasing fierceness of the Persian mews. So it was written that the carpet should bring food for 199 Persian cats, and the paper was pinned to the carpet as before. The carpet seemed to gather itself together, and the cats dropped off it, as raindrops do from your mackintosh when you shake it. And the carpet disappeared. Unless you have had one-hundred and ninety-nine well-grown Persian cats in one small room, all hungry, and all saying so in unmistakable mews, you can form but a poor idea of the noise that now deafened the children and the Phoenix. The cats did not seem to have been at all properly brought up. They seemed to have no idea of its being a mistake in manners to ask for meals in a strange house, let alone to howl for them, and they mewed, and they mewed, and they mewed, and they mewed, till the children poked their fingers into their ears and waited in silent agony, wondering why the whole of Camden Town did not come knocking at the door to ask what was the matter, and only hoping that the food for the cats would come before the neighbours did, and before all the secret of the carpet and the Phoenix had to be given away beyond recall to an indignant neighbourhood. The cats mewed and mewed and twisted their Persian forms in and out and unfolded their Persian tails, and the children and the Phoenix huddled together on the table. The Phoenix, Robert noticed suddenly, was trembling. ‘So many cats,’ it said, ‘and they might not know I was the Phoenix. These accidents happen so quickly. It quite un-mans me.’ This was a danger of which the children had not thought. ‘Creep in,’ cried Robert, opening his jacket. And the Phoenix crept in, only just in time, for green eyes had glared, pink noses had sniffed, white whiskers had twitched, and as Robert buttoned his coat he disappeared to the waist in a wave of eager grey Persian fur. And on the instant the good carpet slapped itself down on the floor. And it was covered with rats, three hundred and ninety-eight of them, I believe, two for each cat. ‘How horrible!’ cried Anthea. ‘Oh, take them away!’ ‘Take yourself away,’ said the Phoenix, ‘and me.’ ‘I wish we’d never had a carpet,’ said Anthea, in tears. They hustled and crowded out of the door, and shut it, and locked it. Cyril, with great presence of mind, lit a candle and turned off the gas at the main. ‘The rats’ll have a better chance in the dark,’ he said. The mewing had ceased. Every one listened in breathless silence. We all know that cats eat rats, it is one of the first things we read in our little brown reading books; but all those cats eating all those rats, it wouldn’t bear thinking of. Suddenly Robert sniffed, in the silence of the dark kitchen, where the only candle was burning all on one side, because of the draught. ‘What a funny scent!’ he said. And as he spoke, a lantern flashed its light through the window of the kitchen, a face peered in, and a voice said,  ‘What’s all this row about? You let me in.’ It was the voice of the police! Robert tip-toed to the window, and spoke through the pane that had been a little cracked since Cyril accidentally knocked it with a walking-stick when he was playing at balancing it on his nose. (It was after they had been to a circus.) ‘What do you mean?’ he said. ‘There’s no row. You listen; everything’s as quiet as quiet.’ And indeed it was. The strange sweet scent grew stronger, and the Phoenix put out its beak. The policeman hesitated. ‘They’re MUSK-rats,’ said the Phoenix. ‘I suppose some cats eat them, but never Persian ones. What a mistake for a well-informed carpet to make! Oh, what a night we’re having!’ ‘Do go away,’ said Robert, nervously. ‘We’re just going to bed, that’s our bedroom candle; there isn’t any row. Everything’s as quiet as a mouse.’ A wild chorus of mews drowned his words, and with the mews were mingled the shrieks of the musk-rats. What had happened? Had the cats tasted them before deciding that they disliked the flavour? ‘I’m a-coming in,’ said the policeman. ‘You’ve got a cat shut up there.’ ‘A cat,’ said Cyril. ‘Oh, my only aunt! A cat!’ ‘Come in, then,’ said Robert. ‘It’s your own look out. I advise you not. Wait a shake, and I’ll undo the side gate.’ He undid the side gate, and the policeman, very cautiously, came in. And there in the kitchen, by the light of one candle, with the mewing and the screaming going like a dozen steam sirens, twenty waiting on motor-cars, and half a hundred squeaking pumps, four agitated voices shouted to the policeman four mixed and wholly different explanations of the very mixed events of the evening. Did you ever try to explain the simplest thing to a policeman? CHAPTER 8. THE CATS, THE COW, AND THE BURGLAR The nursery was full of Persian cats and musk-rats that had been brought there by the wishing carpet. The cats were mewing and the musk-rats were squeaking so that you could hardly hear yourself speak. In the kitchen were the four children, one candle, a concealed Phoenix, and a very visible policeman. ‘Now then, look here,’ said the Policeman, very loudly, and he pointed his lantern at each child in turn, ‘what’s the meaning of this here yelling and caterwauling. I tell you you’ve got a cat here, and some one’s a ill-treating of it. What do you mean by it, eh?’ It was five to one, counting the Phoenix; but the policeman, who was one, was of unusually fine size, and the five, including the Phoenix, were small. The mews and the squeaks grew softer, and in the comparative silence, Cyril said,  ‘It’s true. There are a few cats here. But we’ve not hurt them. It’s quite the opposite. We’ve just fed them.’ ‘It don’t sound like it,’ said the policeman grimly. ‘I daresay they’re not REAL cats,’ said Jane madly, perhaps they’re only dream-cats.’ ‘I’ll dream-cat you, my lady,’ was the brief response of the force. ‘If you understood anything except people who do murders and stealings and naughty things like that, I’d tell you all about it,’ said Robert; ‘but I’m certain you don’t. You’re not meant to shove your oar into people’s private cat-keepings. You’re only supposed to interfere when people shout “murder” and “stop thief” in the street. So there!’ The policeman assured them that he should see about that; and at this point the Phoenix, who had been making itself small on the pot-shelf under the dresser, among the saucepan lids and the fish-kettle, walked on tip-toed claws in a noiseless and modest manner, and left the room unnoticed by any one. ‘Oh, don’t be so horrid,’ Anthea was saying, gently and earnestly. ‘We LOVE cats, dear pussy-soft things. We wouldn’t hurt them for worlds. Would we, Pussy?’ And Jane answered that of course they wouldn’t. And still the policeman seemed unmoved by their eloquence. ‘Now, look here,’ he said, ‘I’m a-going to see what’s in that room beyond there, and, ’ His voice was drowned in a wild burst of mewing and squeaking. And as soon as it died down all four children began to explain at once; and though the squeaking and mewing were not at their very loudest, yet there was quite enough of both to make it very hard for the policeman to understand a single word of any of the four wholly different explanations now poured out to him. ‘Stow it,’ he said at last. ‘I’m a-goin’ into the next room in the execution of my duty. I’m a-goin’ to use my eyes, my ears have gone off their chumps, what with you and them cats.’ And he pushed Robert aside, and strode through the door. ‘Don’t say I didn’t warn you,’ said Robert. ‘It’s tigers REALLY,’ said Jane. ‘Father said so. I wouldn’t go in, if I were you.’ But the policeman was quite stony; nothing any one said seemed to make any difference to him. Some policemen are like this, I believe. He strode down the passage, and in another moment he would have been in the room with all the cats and all the rats (musk), but at that very instant a thin, sharp voice screamed from the street outside,  ‘Murder, murder! Stop thief!’ The policeman stopped, with one regulation boot heavily poised in the air. ‘Eh?’ he said. And again the shrieks sounded shrilly and piercingly from the dark street outside. ‘Come on,’ said Robert. ‘Come and look after cats while somebody’s being killed outside.’ For Robert had an inside feeling that told him quite plainly WHO it was that was screaming. ‘You young rip,’ said the policeman, ‘I’ll settle up with you bimeby.’ And he rushed out, and the children heard his boots going weightily along the pavement, and the screams also going along, rather ahead of the policeman; and both the murder-screams and the policeman’s boots faded away in the remote distance. Then Robert smacked his knickerbocker loudly with his palm, and said,  ‘Good old Phoenix! I should know its golden voice anywhere.’ And then every one understood how cleverly the Phoenix had caught at what Robert had said about the real work of a policeman being to look after murderers and thieves, and not after cats, and all hearts were filled with admiring affection. ‘But he’ll come back,’ said Anthea, mournfully, ‘as soon as it finds the murderer is only a bright vision of a dream, and there isn’t one at all really.’ ‘No he won’t,’ said the soft voice of the clever Phoenix, as it flew in. ‘HE DOES NOT KNOW WHERE YOUR HOUSE IS. I heard him own as much to a fellow mercenary. Oh! what a night we are having! Lock the door, and let us rid ourselves of this intolerable smell of the perfume peculiar to the musk-rat and to the house of the trimmers of beards. If you’ll excuse me, I will go to bed. I am worn out.’ It was Cyril who wrote the paper that told the carpet to take away the rats and bring milk, because there seemed to be no doubt in any breast that, however Persian cats may be, they must like milk. ‘Let’s hope it won’t be musk-milk,’ said Anthea, in gloom, as she pinned the paper face-downwards on the carpet. ‘Is there such a thing as a musk-cow?’ she added anxiously, as the carpet shrivelled and vanished. ‘I do hope not. Perhaps really it WOULD have been wiser to let the carpet take the cats away. It’s getting quite late, and we can’t keep them all night.’ ‘Oh, can’t we?’ was the bitter rejoinder of Robert, who had been fastening the side door. ‘You might have consulted me,’ he went on. ‘I’m not such an idiot as some people.’ ‘Why, whatever, ’ ‘Don’t you see? We’ve jolly well GOT to keep the cats all night, oh, get down, you furry beasts!, because we’ve had three wishes out of the old carpet now, and we can’t get any more till to-morrow.’ The liveliness of Persian mews alone prevented the occurrence of a dismal silence. Anthea spoke first. ‘Never mind,’ she said. ‘Do you know, I really do think they’re quieting down a bit. Perhaps they heard us say milk.’ ‘They can’t understand English,’ said Jane. ‘You forget they’re Persian cats, Panther.’ ‘Well,’ said Anthea, rather sharply, for she was tired and anxious, ‘who told you “milk” wasn’t Persian for milk. Lots of English words are just the same in French, at least I know “miaw” is, and “croquet”, and “fiance”. Oh, pussies, do be quiet! Let’s stroke them as hard as we can with both hands, and perhaps they’ll stop.’ So every one stroked grey fur till their hands were tired, and as soon as a cat had been stroked enough to make it stop mewing it was pushed gently away, and another mewing mouser was approached by the hands of the strokers. And the noise was really more than half purr when the carpet suddenly appeared in its proper place, and on it, instead of rows of milk-cans, or even of milk-jugs, there was a COW. Not a Persian cow, either, nor, most fortunately, a musk-cow, if there is such a thing, but a smooth, sleek, dun-coloured Jersey cow, who blinked large soft eyes at the gas-light and mooed in an amiable if rather inquiring manner. Anthea had always been afraid of cows; but now she tried to be brave. ‘Anyway, it can’t run after me,’ she said to herself ‘There isn’t room for it even to begin to run.’ The cow was perfectly placid. She behaved like a strayed duchess till some one brought a saucer for the milk, and some one else tried to milk the cow into it. Milking is very difficult. You may think it is easy, but it is not. All the children were by this time strung up to a pitch of heroism that would have been impossible to them in their ordinary condition. Robert and Cyril held the cow by the horns; and Jane, when she was quite sure that their end of the cow was quite secure, consented to stand by, ready to hold the cow by the tail should occasion arise. Anthea, holding the saucer, now advanced towards the cow. She remembered to have heard that cows, when milked by strangers, are susceptible to the soothing influence of the human voice. So, clutching her saucer very tight, she sought for words to whose soothing influence the cow might be susceptible. And her memory, troubled by the events of the night, which seemed to go on and on for ever and ever, refused to help her with any form of words suitable to address a Jersey cow in. ‘Poor pussy, then. Lie down, then, good dog, lie down!’ was all that she could think of to say, and she said it. And nobody laughed. The situation, full of grey mewing cats, was too serious for that. Then Anthea, with a beating heart, tried to milk the cow. Next moment the cow had knocked the saucer out of her hand and trampled on it with one foot, while with the other three she had walked on a foot each of Robert, Cyril, and Jane. Jane burst into tears. ‘Oh, how much too horrid everything is!’ she cried. ‘Come away. Let’s go to bed and leave the horrid cats with the hateful cow. Perhaps somebody will eat somebody else. And serve them right.’ They did not go to bed, but they had a shivering council in the drawing-room, which smelt of soot, and, indeed, a heap of this lay in the fender. There had been no fire in the room since mother went away, and all the chairs and tables were in the wrong places, and the chrysanthemums were dead, and the water in the pot nearly dried up. Anthea wrapped the embroidered woolly sofa blanket round Jane and herself, while Robert and Cyril had a struggle, silent and brief, but fierce, for the larger share of the fur hearthrug. ‘It is most truly awful,’ said Anthea, ‘and I am so tired. Let’s let the cats loose.’ ‘And the cow, perhaps?’ said Cyril. ‘The police would find us at once. That cow would stand at the gate and mew, I mean moo, to come in. And so would the cats. No; I see quite well what we’ve got to do. We must put them in baskets and leave them on people’s doorsteps, like orphan foundlings.’ ‘We’ve got three baskets, counting mother’s work one,’ said Jane brightening. ‘And there are nearly two hundred cats,’ said Anthea, ‘besides the cow, and it would have to be a different-sized basket for her; and then I don’t know how you’d carry it, and you’d never find a doorstep big enough to put it on. Except the church one, and, ’ ‘Oh, well,’ said Cyril, ‘if you simply MAKE difficulties, ’ ‘I’m with you,’ said Robert. ‘Don’t fuss about the cow, Panther. It’s simply GOT to stay the night, and I’m sure I’ve read that the cow is a remunerating creature, and that means it will sit still and think for hours. The carpet can take it away in the morning. And as for the baskets, we’ll do them up in dusters, or pillow-cases, or bath-towels. Come on, Squirrel. You girls can be out of it if you like.’ His tone was full of contempt, but Jane and Anthea were too tired and desperate to care; even being ‘out of it’, which at other times they could not have borne, now seemed quite a comfort. They snuggled down in the sofa blanket, and Cyril threw the fur hearthrug over them. ‘Ah, he said, ‘that’s all women are fit for, to keep safe and warm, while the men do the work and run dangers and risks and things.’ ‘I’m not,’ said Anthea, ‘you know I’m not.’ But Cyril was gone. It was warm under the blanket and the hearthrug, and Jane snuggled up close to her sister; and Anthea cuddled Jane closely and kindly, and in a sort of dream they heard the rise of a wave of mewing as Robert opened the door of the nursery. They heard the booted search for baskets in the back kitchen. They heard the side door open and close, and they knew that each brother had gone out with at least one cat. Anthea’s last thought was that it would take at least all night to get rid of one hundred and ninety-nine cats by twos. There would be ninety-nine journeys of two cats each, and one cat over. ‘I almost think we might keep the one cat over,’ said Anthea. ‘I don’t seem to care for cats just now, but I daresay I shall again some day.’ And she fell asleep. Jane also was sleeping. It was Jane who awoke with a start, to find Anthea still asleep. As, in the act of awakening, she kicked her sister, she wondered idly why they should have gone to bed in their boots; but the next moment she remembered where they were. There was a sound of muffled, shuffled feet on the stairs. Like the heroine of the classic poem, Jane ‘thought it was the boys’, and as she felt quite wide awake, and not nearly so tired as before, she crept gently from Anthea’s side and followed the footsteps. They went down into the basement; the cats, who seemed to have fallen into the sleep of exhaustion, awoke at the sound of the approaching footsteps and mewed piteously. Jane was at the foot of the stairs before she saw it was not her brothers whose coming had roused her and the cats, but a burglar. She knew he was a burglar at once, because he wore a fur cap and a red and black charity-check comforter, and he had no business where he was. If you had been stood in jane’s shoes you would no doubt have run away in them, appealing to the police and neighbours with horrid screams. But Jane knew better. She had read a great many nice stories about burglars, as well as some affecting pieces of poetry, and she knew that no burglar will ever hurt a little girl if he meets her when burgling. Indeed, in all the cases Jane had read of, his burglarishness was almost at once forgotten in the interest he felt in the little girl’s artless prattle. So if Jane hesitated for a moment before addressing the burglar, it was only because she could not at once think of any remark sufficiently prattling and artless to make a beginning with. In the stories and the affecting poetry the child could never speak plainly, though it always looked old enough to in the pictures. And Jane could not make up her mind to lisp and ‘talk baby’, even to a burglar. And while she hesitated he softly opened the nursery door and went in. Jane followed, just in time to see him sit down flat on the floor, scattering cats as a stone thrown into a pool splashes water. She closed the door softly and stood there, still wondering whether she COULD bring herself to say, ‘What’s ‘oo doing here, Mithter Wobber?’ and whether any other kind of talk would do. Then she heard the burglar draw a long breath, and he spoke. ‘It’s a judgement,’ he said, ‘so help me bob if it ain’t. Oh, ‘ere’s a thing to ‘appen to a chap! Makes it come ‘ome to you, don’t it neither? Cats an’ cats an’ cats. There couldn’t be all them cats. Let alone the cow. If she ain’t the moral of the old man’s Daisy. She’s a dream out of when I was a lad, I don’t mind ‘er so much. ‘Ere, Daisy, Daisy?’ The cow turned and looked at him. ‘SHE’S all right,’ he went on. ‘Sort of company, too. Though them above knows how she got into this downstairs parlour. But them cats, oh, take ‘em away, take ‘em away! I’ll chuck the ‘ole show, Oh, take ‘em away.’ ‘Burglar,’ said Jane, close behind him, and he started convulsively, and turned on her a blank face, whose pale lips trembled. ‘I can’t take those cats away.’ ‘Lor’ lumme!’ exclaimed the man; ‘if ‘ere ain’t another on ‘em. Are you real, miss, or something I’ll wake up from presently?’ ‘I am quite real,’ said Jane, relieved to find that a lisp was not needed to make the burglar understand her. ‘And so,’ she added, ‘are the cats.’ ‘Then send for the police, send for the police, and I’ll go quiet. If you ain’t no realler than them cats, I’m done, spunchuck, out of time. Send for the police. I’ll go quiet. One thing, there’d not be room for ‘arf them cats in no cell as ever  I  see.’ He ran his fingers through his hair, which was short, and his eyes wandered wildly round the roomful of cats. ‘Burglar,’ said Jane, kindly and softly, ‘if you didn’t like cats, what did you come here for?’ ‘Send for the police,’ was the unfortunate criminal’s only reply. ‘I’d rather you would, honest, I’d rather.’ ‘I daren’t,’ said Jane, ‘and besides, I’ve no one to send. I hate the police. I wish he’d never been born.’ ‘You’ve a feeling ‘art, miss,’ said the burglar; ‘but them cats is really a little bit too thick.’ ‘Look here,’ said Jane, ‘I won’t call the police. And I am quite a real little girl, though I talk older than the kind you’ve met before when you’ve been doing your burglings. And they are real cats, and they want real milk, and, Didn’t you say the cow was like somebody’s Daisy that you used to know?’ ‘Wish I may die if she ain’t the very spit of her,’ replied the man. ‘Well, then,’ said Jane, and a thrill of joyful pride ran through her, ‘perhaps you know how to milk cows?’ ‘Perhaps I does,’ was the burglar’s cautious rejoinder. ‘Then,’ said Jane, ‘if you will ONLY milk ours, you don’t know how we shall always love you.’ The burglar replied that loving was all very well. ‘If those cats only had a good long, wet, thirsty drink of milk,’ Jane went on with eager persuasion, ‘they’d lie down and go to sleep as likely as not, and then the police won’t come back. But if they go on mewing like this he will, and then I don’t know what’ll become of us, or you either.’ This argument seemed to decide the criminal. Jane fetched the wash-bowl from the sink, and he spat on his hands and prepared to milk the cow. At this instant boots were heard on the stairs. ‘It’s all up,’ said the man, desperately, ‘this ‘ere’s a plant. ‘ERE’S the police.’ He made as if to open the window and leap from it. ‘It’s all right, I tell you,’ whispered Jane, in anguish. ‘I’ll say you’re a friend of mine, or the good clergyman called in, or my uncle, or ANYTHING, only do, do, do milk the cow. Oh, DON’T go, oh, oh, thank goodness it’s only the boys!’ It was; and their entrance had awakened Anthea, who, with her brothers, now crowded through the doorway. The man looked about him like a rat looks round a trap. ‘This is a friend of mine,’ said Jane; ‘he’s just called in, and he’s going to milk the cow for us. ISN’T it good and kind of him?’ She winked at the others, and though they did not understand they played up loyally. ‘How do?’ said Cyril, ‘Very glad to meet you. Don’t let us interrupt the milking.’ ‘I shall ‘ave a ‘ead and a ‘arf in the morning, and no bloomin’ error,’ remarked the burglar; but he began to milk the cow. Robert was winked at to stay and see that he did not leave off milking or try to escape, and the others went to get things to put the milk in; for it was now spurting and foaming in the wash-bowl, and the cats had ceased from mewing and were crowding round the cow, with expressions of hope and anticipation on their whiskered faces. ‘We can’t get rid of any more cats,’ said Cyril, as he and his sisters piled a tray high with saucers and soup-plates and platters and pie-dishes, ‘the police nearly got us as it was. Not the same one, a much stronger sort. He thought it really was a foundling orphan we’d got. If it hadn’t been for me throwing the two bags of cat slap in his eye and hauling Robert over a railing, and lying like mice under a laurel-bush, Well, it’s jolly lucky I’m a good shot, that’s all. He pranced off when he’d got the cat-bags off his face, thought we’d bolted. And here we are.’ The gentle samishness of the milk swishing into the hand-bowl seemed to have soothed the burglar very much. He went on milking in a sort of happy dream, while the children got a cap and ladled the warm milk out into the pie-dishes and plates, and platters and saucers, and set them down to the music of Persian purrs and lappings. ‘It makes me think of old times,’ said the burglar, smearing his ragged coat-cuff across his eyes, ‘about the apples in the orchard at home, and the rats at threshing time, and the rabbits and the ferrets, and how pretty it was seeing the pigs killed.’ Finding him in this softened mood, Jane said,  ‘I wish you’d tell us how you came to choose our house for your burglaring to-night. I am awfully glad you did. You have been so kind. I don’t know what we should have done without you,’ she added hastily. ‘We all love you ever so. Do tell us.’ The others added their affectionate entreaties, and at last the burglar said,  ‘Well, it’s my first job, and I didn’t expect to be made so welcome, and that’s the truth, young gents and ladies. And I don’t know but what it won’t be my last. For this ‘ere cow, she reminds me of my father, and I know ‘ow ‘e’d ‘ave ‘ided me if I’d laid ‘ands on a ‘a’penny as wasn’t my own.’ ‘I’m sure he would,’ Jane agreed kindly; ‘but what made you come here?’ ‘Well, miss,’ said the burglar, ‘you know best ‘ow you come by them cats, and why you don’t like the police, so I’ll give myself away free, and trust to your noble ‘earts. (You’d best bale out a bit, the pan’s getting fullish.) I was a-selling oranges off of my barrow, for I ain’t a burglar by trade, though you ‘ave used the name so free, an’ there was a lady bought three ‘a’porth off me. An’ while she was a-pickin’ of them out, very careful indeed, and I’m always glad when them sort gets a few over-ripe ones, there was two other ladies talkin’ over the fence. An’ one on ‘em said to the other on ‘em just like this,  “‘I’ve told both gells to come, and they can doss in with M’ria and Jane, ‘cause their boss and his missis is miles away and the kids too. So they can just lock up the ‘ouse and leave the gas a-burning, so’s no one won’t know, and get back bright an’ early by ‘leven o’clock. And we’ll make a night of it, Mrs Prosser, so we will. I’m just a-going to run out to pop the letter in the post.” And then the lady what had chosen the three ha’porth so careful, she said: “Lor, Mrs Wigson, I wonder at you, and your hands all over suds. This good gentleman’ll slip it into the post for yer, I’ll be bound, seeing I’m a customer of his.”  So they give me the letter, and of course I read the direction what was written on it afore I shoved it into the post. And then when I’d sold my barrowful, I was a-goin’ ‘ome with the chink in my pocket, and I’m blowed if some bloomin’ thievin’ beggar didn’t nick the lot whilst I was just a-wettin’ of my whistle, for callin’ of oranges is dry work. Nicked the bloomin’ lot ‘e did, and me with not a farden to take ‘ome to my brother and his missus.’ ‘How awful!’ said Anthea, with much sympathy. ‘Horful indeed, miss, I believe yer,’ the burglar rejoined, with deep feeling. ‘You don’t know her temper when she’s roused. An’ I’m sure I ‘ope you never may, neither. And I’d ‘ad all my oranges off of ‘em. So it came back to me what was wrote on the ongverlope, and I says to myself, “Why not, seein’ as I’ve been done myself, and if they keeps two slaveys there must be some pickings?” An’ so ‘ere I am. But them cats, they’ve brought me back to the ways of honestness. Never no more.’ ‘Look here,’ said Cyril, ‘these cats are very valuable, very indeed. And we will give them all to you, if only you will take them away.’ ‘I see they’re a breedy lot,’ replied the burglar. ‘But I don’t want no bother with the coppers. Did you come by them honest now? Straight?’ ‘They are all our very own,’ said Anthea, ‘we wanted them, but the confidement, ’ ‘Consignment,’ whispered Cyril, ‘was larger than we wanted, and they’re an awful bother. If you got your barrow, and some sacks or baskets, your brother’s missus would be awfully pleased. My father says Persian cats are worth pounds and pounds each.’ ‘Well,’ said the burglar, and he was certainly moved by her remarks, ‘I see you’re in a hole, and I don’t mind lending a helping ‘and. I don’t ask ‘ow you come by them. But I’ve got a pal, ‘e’s a mark on cats. I’ll fetch him along, and if he thinks they’d fetch anything above their skins I don’t mind doin’ you a kindness.’ ‘You won’t go away and never come back,’ said Jane, ‘because I don’t think I COULD bear that.’ The burglar, quite touched by her emotion, swore sentimentally that, alive or dead, he would come back. Then he went, and Cyril and Robert sent the girls to bed and sat up to wait for his return. It soon seemed absurd to await him in a state of wakefulness, but his stealthy tap on the window awoke them readily enough. For he did return, with the pal and the barrow and the sacks. The pal approved of the cats, now dormant in Persian repletion, and they were bundled into the sacks, and taken away on the barrow, mewing, indeed, but with mews too sleepy to attract public attention. ‘I’m a fence, that’s what I am,’ said the burglar gloomily. ‘I never thought I’d come down to this, and all acause er my kind ‘eart.’ Cyril knew that a fence is a receiver of stolen goods, and he replied briskly,  ‘I give you my sacred the cats aren’t stolen. What do you make the time?’ ‘I ain’t got the time on me,’ said the pal, ‘but it was just about chucking-out time as I come by the “Bull and Gate”. I shouldn’t wonder if it was nigh upon one now.’ When the cats had been removed, and the boys and the burglar had parted with warm expressions of friendship, there remained only the cow. ‘She must stay all night,’ said Robert. ‘Cook’ll have a fit when she sees her.’ ‘All night?’ said Cyril. ‘Why, it’s tomorrow morning if it’s one. We can have another wish!’ So the carpet was urged, in a hastily written note, to remove the cow to wherever she belonged, and to return to its proper place on the nursery floor. But the cow could not be got to move on to the carpet. So Robert got the clothes line out of the back kitchen, and tied one end very firmly to the cow’s horns, and the other end to a bunched-up corner of the carpet, and said ‘Fire away.’ And the carpet and cow vanished together, and the boys went to bed, tired out and only too thankful that the evening at last was over. Next morning the carpet lay calmly in its place, but one corner was very badly torn. It was the corner that the cow had been tied on to. CHAPTER 9. THE BURGLAR’S BRIDE The morning after the adventure of the Persian cats, the musk-rats, the common cow, and the uncommon burglar, all the children slept till it was ten o’clock; and then it was only Cyril who woke; but he attended to the others, so that by half past ten every one was ready to help to get breakfast. It was shivery cold, and there was but little in the house that was really worth eating. Robert had arranged a thoughtful little surprise for the absent servants. He had made a neat and delightful booby trap over the kitchen door, and as soon as they heard the front door click open and knew the servants had come back, all four children hid in the cupboard under the stairs and listened with delight to the entrance, the tumble, the splash, the scuffle, and the remarks of the servants. They heard the cook say it was a judgement on them for leaving the place to itself; she seemed to think that a booby trap was a kind of plant that was quite likely to grow, all by itself, in a dwelling that was left shut up. But the housemaid, more acute, judged that someone must have been in the house, a view confirmed by the sight of the breakfast things on the nursery table. The cupboard under the stairs was very tight and paraffiny, however, and a silent struggle for a place on top ended in the door bursting open and discharging Jane, who rolled like a football to the feet of the servants. ‘Now,’ said Cyril, firmly, when the cook’s hysterics had become quieter, and the housemaid had time to say what she thought of them, ‘don’t you begin jawing us. We aren’t going to stand it. We know too much. You’ll please make an extra special treacle roley for dinner, and we’ll have a tinned tongue.’ ‘I daresay,’ said the housemaid, indignant, still in her outdoor things and with her hat very much on one side. ‘Don’t you come a-threatening me, Master Cyril, because I won’t stand it, so I tell you. You tell your ma about us being out? Much I care! She’ll be sorry for me when she hears about my dear great-aunt by marriage as brought me up from a child and was a mother to me. She sent for me, she did, she wasn’t expected to last the night, from the spasms going to her legs, and cook was that kind and careful she couldn’t let me go alone, so, ’ ‘Don’t,’ said Anthea, in real distress. ‘You know where liars go to, Eliza, at least if you don’t, ’ ‘Liars indeed!’ said Eliza, ‘I won’t demean myself talking to you.’ ‘How’s Mrs Wigson?’ said Robert, ‘and DID you keep it up last night?’ The mouth of the housemaid fell open. ‘Did you doss with Maria or Emily?’ asked Cyril. ‘How did Mrs Prosser enjoy herself?’ asked Jane. ‘Forbear,’ said Cyril, ‘they’ve had enough. Whether we tell or not depends on your later life,’ he went on, addressing the servants. ‘If you are decent to us we’ll be decent to you. You’d better make that treacle roley, and if I were you, Eliza, I’d do a little housework and cleaning, just for a change.’ The servants gave in once and for all. ‘There’s nothing like firmness,’ Cyril went on, when the breakfast things were cleared away and the children were alone in the nursery. ‘People are always talking of difficulties with servants. It’s quite simple, when you know the way. We can do what we like now and they won’t peach. I think we’ve broken THEIR proud spirit. Let’s go somewhere by carpet.’ ‘I wouldn’t if I were you,’ said the Phoenix, yawning, as it swooped down from its roost on the curtain pole. ‘I’ve given you one or two hints, but now concealment is at an end, and I see I must speak out.’ It perched on the back of a chair and swayed to and fro, like a parrot on a swing. ‘What’s the matter now?’ said Anthea. She was not quite so gentle as usual, because she was still weary from the excitement of last night’s cats. ‘I’m tired of things happening. I shan’t go anywhere on the carpet. I’m going to darn my stockings.’ ‘Darn!’ said the Phoenix, ‘darn! From those young lips these strange expressions, ’ ‘Mend, then,’ said Anthea, ‘with a needle and wool.’ The Phoenix opened and shut its wings thoughtfully. ‘Your stockings,’ it said, ‘are much less important than they now appear to you. But the carpet, look at the bare worn patches, look at the great rent at yonder corner. The carpet has been your faithful friend, your willing servant. How have you requited its devoted service?’ ‘Dear Phoenix,’ Anthea urged, ‘don’t talk in that horrid lecturing tone. You make me feel as if I’d done something wrong. And really it is a wishing carpet, and we haven’t done anything else to it, only wishes.’ ‘Only wishes,’ repeated the Phoenix, ruffling its neck feathers angrily, ‘and what sort of wishes? Wishing people to be in a good temper, for instance. What carpet did you ever hear of that had such a wish asked of it? But this noble fabric, on which you trample so recklessly’ (every one removed its boots from the carpet and stood on the linoleum), ‘this carpet never flinched. It did what you asked, but the wear and tear must have been awful. And then last night, I don’t blame you about the cats and the rats, for those were its own choice; but what carpet could stand a heavy cow hanging on to it at one corner?’ ‘I should think the cats and rats were worse,’ said Robert, ‘look at all their claws.’ ‘Yes,’ said the bird, ‘eleven thousand nine hundred and forty of them, I daresay you noticed? I should be surprised if these had not left their mark.’ ‘Good gracious,’ said Jane, sitting down suddenly on the floor, and patting the edge of the carpet softly; ‘do you mean it’s WEARING OUT?’ ‘Its life with you has not been a luxurious one,’ said the Phoenix. ‘French mud twice. Sand of sunny shores twice. Soaking in southern seas once. India once. Goodness knows where in Persia once. Musk-rat-land once. And once, wherever the cow came from. Hold your carpet up to the light, and with cautious tenderness, if YOU please.’ With cautious tenderness the boys held the carpet up to the light; the girls looked, and a shiver of regret ran through them as they saw how those eleven thoousand nine hundred and forty claws had run through the carpet. It was full of little holes: there were some large ones, and more than one thin place. At one corner a strip of it was torn, and hung forlornly. ‘We must mend it,’ said Anthea; ‘never mind about my stockings. I can sew them up in lumps with sewing cotton if there’s no time to do them properly. I know it’s awful and no girl would who respected herself, and all that; but the poor dear carpet’s more important than my silly stockings. Let’s go out now this very minute.’ So out they all went, and bought wool to mend the carpet; but there is no shop in Camden Town where you can buy wishing-wool, no, nor in Kentish Town either. However, ordinary Scotch heather-mixture fingering seemed good enough, and this they bought, and all that day Jane and Anthea darned and darned and darned. The boys went out for a walk in the afternoon, and the gentle Phoenix paced up and down the table, for exercise, as it said, and talked to the industrious girls about their carpet. ‘It is not an ordinary, ignorant, innocent carpet from Kidderminster,’ it said, ‘it is a carpet with a past, a Persian past. Do you know that in happier years, when that carpet was the property of caliphs, viziers, kings, and sultans, it never lay on a floor?’ ‘I thought the floor was the proper home of a carpet,’ Jane interrupted. ‘Not of a MAGIC carpet,’ said the Phoenix; ‘why, if it had been allowed to lie about on floors there wouldn’t be much of it left now. No, indeed! It has lived in chests of cedarwood, inlaid with pearl and ivory, wrapped in priceless tissues of cloth of gold, embroidered with gems of fabulous value. It has reposed in the sandal-wood caskets of princesses, and in the rose-attar-scented treasure-houses of kings. Never, never, had any one degraded it by walking on it, except in the way of business, when wishes were required, and then they always took their shoes off. And YOU, ’ ‘Oh, DON’T!’ said Jane, very near tears. ‘You know you’d never have been hatched at all if it hadn’t been for mother wanting a carpet for us to walk on.’ ‘You needn’t have walked so much or so hard!’ said the bird, ‘but come, dry that crystal tear, and I will relate to you the story of the Princess Zulieka, the Prince of Asia, and the magic carpet.’ ‘Relate away,’ said Anthea, ‘I mean, please do.’ ‘The Princess Zulieka, fairest of royal ladies,’ began the bird, ‘had in her cradle been the subject of several enchantments. Her grandmother had been in her day, ’ But what in her day Zulieka’s grandmother had been was destined never to be revealed, for Cyril and Robert suddenly burst into the room, and on each brow were the traces of deep emotion. On Cyril’s pale brow stood beads of agitation and perspiration, and on the scarlet brow of Robert was a large black smear. ‘What ails ye both?’ asked the Phoenix, and it added tartly that story-telling was quite impossible if people would come interrupting like that. ‘Oh, do shut up, for any sake!’ said Cyril, sinking into a chair. Robert smoothed the ruffled golden feathers, adding kindly,  ‘Squirrel doesn’t mean to be a beast. It’s only that the MOST AWFUL thing has happened, and stories don’t seem to matter so much. Don’t be cross. You won’t be when you’ve heard what’s happened.’ ‘Well, what HAS happened?’ said the bird, still rather crossly; and Anthea and Jane paused with long needles poised in air, and long needlefuls of Scotch heather-mixture fingering wool drooping from them. ‘The most awful thing you can possibly think of,’ said Cyril. ‘That nice chap, our own burglar, the police have got him, on suspicion of stolen cats. That’s what his brother’s missis told me.’ ‘Oh, begin at the beginning!’ cried Anthea impatiently. ‘Well, then, we went out, and down by where the undertaker’s is, with the china flowers in the window, you know. There was a crowd, and of course we went to have a squint. And it was two bobbies and our burglar between them, and he was being dragged along; and he said, “I tell you them cats was GIVE me. I got ‘em in exchange for me milking a cow in a basement parlour up Camden Town way.” ‘And the people laughed. Beasts! And then one of the policemen said perhaps he could give the name and address of the cow, and he said, no, he couldn’t; but he could take them there if they’d only leave go of his coat collar, and give him a chance to get his breath. And the policeman said he could tell all that to the magistrate in the morning. He didn’t see us, and so we came away.’ ‘Oh, Cyril, how COULD you?’ said Anthea. ‘Don’t be a pudding-head,’ Cyril advised. ‘A fat lot of good it would have done if we’d let him see us. No one would have believed a word we said. They’d have thought we were kidding. We did better than let him see us. We asked a boy where he lived and he told us, and we went there, and it’s a little greengrocer’s shop, and we bought some Brazil nuts. Here they are.’ The girls waved away the Brazil nuts with loathing and contempt. ‘Well, we had to buy SOMETHING, and while we were making up our minds what to buy we heard his brother’s missis talking. She said when he came home with all them miaoulers she thought there was more in it than met the eye. But he WOULD go out this morning with the two likeliest of them, one under each arm. She said he sent her out to buy blue ribbon to put round their beastly necks, and she said if he got three months’ hard it was her dying word that he’d got the blue ribbon to thank for it; that, and his own silly thieving ways, taking cats that anybody would know he couldn’t have come by in the way of business, instead of things that wouldn’t have been missed, which Lord knows there are plenty such, and, ’ ‘Oh, STOP!’ cried Jane. And indeed it was time, for Cyril seemed like a clock that had been wound up, and could not help going on. ‘Where is he now?’ ‘At the police-station,’ said Robert, for Cyril was out of breath. ‘The boy told us they’d put him in the cells, and would bring him up before the Beak in the morning. I thought it was a jolly lark last night, getting him to take the cats, but now, ’ ‘The end of a lark,’ said the Phoenix, ‘is the Beak.’ ‘Let’s go to him,’ cried both the girls jumping up. ‘Let’s go and tell the truth. They MUST believe us.’ ‘They CAN’T,’ said Cyril. ‘Just think! If any one came to you with such a tale, you couldn’t believe it, however much you tried. We should only mix things up worse for him.’ ‘There must be something we could do,’ said Jane, sniffing very much, ‘my own dear pet burglar! I can’t bear it. And he was so nice, the way he talked about his father, and how he was going to be so extra honest. Dear Phoenix, you MUST be able to help us. You’re so good and kind and pretty and clever. Do, do tell us what to do.’ The Phoenix rubbed its beak thoughtfully with its claw. ‘You might rescue him,’ it said, ‘and conceal him here, till the law-supporters had forgotten about him.’ ‘That would be ages and ages,’ said Cyril, ‘and we couldn’t conceal him here. Father might come home at any moment, and if he found the burglar here HE wouldn’t believe the true truth any more than the police would. That’s the worst of the truth. Nobody ever believes it. Couldn’t we take him somewhere else?’ Jane clapped her hands. ‘The sunny southern shore!’ she cried, ‘where the cook is being queen. He and she would be company for each other!’ And really the idea did not seem bad, if only he would consent to go. So, all talking at once, the children arranged to wait till evening, and then to seek the dear burglar in his lonely cell. Meantime Jane and Anthea darned away as hard as they could, to make the carpet as strong as possible. For all felt how terrible it would be if the precious burglar, while being carried to the sunny southern shore, were to tumble through a hole in the carpet, and be lost for ever in the sunny southern sea. The servants were tired after Mrs Wigson’s party, so every one went to bed early, and when the Phoenix reported that both servants were snoring in a heartfelt and candid manner, the children got up, they had never undressed; just putting their nightgowns on over their things had been enough to deceive Eliza when she came to turn out the gas. So they were ready for anything, and they stood on the carpet and said,  ‘I wish we were in our burglar’s lonely cell.’ and instantly they were. I think every one had expected the cell to be the ‘deepest dungeon below the castle moat’. I am sure no one had doubted that the burglar, chained by heavy fetters to a ring in the damp stone wall, would be tossing uneasily on a bed of straw, with a pitcher of water and a mouldering crust, untasted, beside him. Robert, remembering the underground passage and the treasure, had brought a candle and matches, but these were not needed. The cell was a little white-washed room about twelve feet long and six feet wide. On one side of it was a sort of shelf sloping a little towards the wall. On this were two rugs, striped blue and yellow, and a water-proof pillow. Rolled in the rugs, and with his head on the pillow, lay the burglar, fast asleep. (He had had his tea, though this the children did not know, it had come from the coffee-shop round the corner, in very thick crockery.) The scene was plainly revealed by the light of a gas-lamp in the passage outside, which shone into the cell through a pane of thick glass over the door. ‘I shall gag him,’ said Cyril, ‘and Robert will hold him down. Anthea and Jane and the Phoenix can whisper soft nothings to him while he gradually awakes.’ This plan did not have the success it deserved, because the burglar, curiously enough, was much stronger, even in his sleep, than Robert and Cyril, and at the first touch of their hands he leapt up and shouted out something very loud indeed. Instantly steps were heard outside. Anthea threw her arms round the burglar and whispered,  ‘It’s us, the ones that gave you the cats. We’ve come to save you, only don’t let on we’re here. Can’t we hide somewhere?’ Heavy boots sounded on the flagged passage outside, and a firm voice shouted,  ‘Here, you, stop that row, will you?’ ‘All right, governor,’ replied the burglar, still with Anthea’s arms round him; ‘I was only a-talking in my sleep. No offence.’ It was an awful moment. Would the boots and the voice come in. Yes! No! The voice said,  ‘Well, stow it, will you?’ And the boots went heavily away, along the passage and up some sounding stone stairs. ‘Now then,’ whispered Anthea. ‘How the blue Moses did you get in?’ asked the burglar, in a hoarse whisper of amazement. ‘On the carpet,’ said Jane, truly. ‘Stow that,’ said the burglar. ‘One on you I could ‘a’ swallowed, but four, AND a yellow fowl.’ ‘Look here,’ said Cyril, sternly, ‘you wouldn’t have believed any one if they’d told you beforehand about your finding a cow and all those cats in our nursery.’ ‘That I wouldn’t,’ said the burglar, with whispered fervour, ‘so help me Bob, I wouldn’t.’ ‘Well, then,’ Cyril went on, ignoring this appeal to his brother, ‘just try to believe what we tell you and act accordingly. It can’t do you any HARM, you know,’ he went on in hoarse whispered earnestness. ‘You can’t be very much worse off than you are now, you know. But if you’ll just trust to us we’ll get you out of this right enough. No one saw us come in. The question is, where would you like to go?’ ‘I’d like to go to Boolong,’ was the instant reply of the burglar. ‘I’ve always wanted to go on that there trip, but I’ve never ‘ad the ready at the right time of the year.’ ‘Boolong is a town like London,’ said Cyril, well meaning, but inaccurate, ‘how could you get a living there?’ The burglar scratched his head in deep doubt. ‘It’s ‘ard to get a ‘onest living anywheres nowadays,’ he said, and his voice was sad. ‘Yes, isn’t it?’ said Jane, sympathetically; ‘but how about a sunny southern shore, where there’s nothing to do at all unless you want to.’ ‘That’s my billet, miss,’ replied the burglar. ‘I never did care about work, not like some people, always fussing about.’ ‘Did you never like any sort of work?’ asked Anthea, severely. ‘Lor’, lumme, yes,’ he answered, ‘gardening was my ‘obby, so it was. But father died afore ‘e could bind me to a nurseryman, an’, ’ ‘We’ll take you to the sunny southern shore,’ said Jane; ‘you’ve no idea what the flowers are like.’ ‘Our old cook’s there,’ said Anthea. ‘She’s queen, ’ ‘Oh, chuck it,’ the burglar whispered, clutching at his head with both hands. ‘I knowed the first minute I see them cats and that cow as it was a judgement on me. I don’t know now whether I’m a-standing on my hat or my boots, so help me I don’t. If you CAN get me out, get me, and if you can’t, get along with you for goodness’ sake, and give me a chanst to think about what’ll be most likely to go down with the Beak in the morning.’ ‘Come on to the carpet, then,’ said Anthea, gently shoving. The others quietly pulled, and the moment the feet of the burglar were planted on the carpet Anthea wished: ‘I wish we were all on the sunny southern shore where cook is.’ And instantly they were. There were the rainbow sands, the tropic glories of leaf and flower, and there, of course, was the cook, crowned with white flowers, and with all the wrinkles of crossness and tiredness and hard work wiped out of her face. ‘Why, cook, you’re quite pretty!’ Anthea said, as soon as she had got her breath after the tumble-rush-whirl of the carpet. The burglar stood rubbing his eyes in the brilliant tropic sunlight, and gazing wildly round him on the vivid hues of the tropic land. ‘Penny plain and tuppence coloured!’ he exclaimed pensively, ‘and well worth any tuppence, however hard-earned.’ The cook was seated on a grassy mound with her court of copper-coloured savages around her. The burglar pointed a grimy finger at these. ‘Are they tame?’ he asked anxiously. ‘Do they bite or scratch, or do anything to yer with poisoned arrows or oyster shells or that?’ ‘Don’t you be so timid,’ said the cook. ‘Look’e ‘ere, this ‘ere’s only a dream what you’ve come into, an’ as it’s only a dream there’s no nonsense about what a young lady like me ought to say or not, so I’ll say you’re the best-looking fellow I’ve seen this many a day. And the dream goes on and on, seemingly, as long as you behaves. The things what you has to eat and drink tastes just as good as real ones, and, ’ ‘Look ‘ere,’ said the burglar, ‘I’ve come ‘ere straight outer the pleece station. These ‘ere kids’ll tell you it ain’t no blame er mine.’ ‘Well, you WERE a burglar, you know,’ said the truthful Anthea gently. ‘Only because I was druv to it by dishonest blokes, as well you knows, miss,’ rejoined the criminal. ‘Blowed if this ain’t the ‘ottest January as I’ve known for years.’ ‘Wouldn’t you like a bath?’ asked the queen, ‘and some white clothes like me?’ ‘I should only look a juggins in ‘em, miss, thanking you all the same,’ was the reply; ‘but a bath I wouldn’t resist, and my shirt was only clean on week before last.’ Cyril and Robert led him to a rocky pool, where he bathed luxuriously. Then, in shirt and trousers he sat on the sand and spoke. ‘That cook, or queen, or whatever you call her, her with the white bokay on her ‘ed, she’s my sort. Wonder if she’d keep company!’ ‘I should ask her.’ ‘I was always a quick hitter,’ the man went on; ‘it’s a word and a blow with me. I will.’ In shirt and trousers, and crowned with a scented flowery wreath which Cyril hastily wove as they returned to the court of the queen, the burglar stood before the cook and spoke. ‘Look ‘ere, miss,’ he said. ‘You an’ me being’ all forlorn-like, both on us, in this ‘ere dream, or whatever you calls it, I’d like to tell you straight as I likes yer looks.’ The cook smiled and looked down bashfully. ‘I’m a single man, what you might call a batcheldore. I’m mild in my ‘abits, which these kids’ll tell you the same, and I’d like to ‘ave the pleasure of walkin’ out with you next Sunday.’ ‘Lor!’ said the queen cook, ‘’ow sudden you are, mister.’ ‘Walking out means you’re going to be married,’ said Anthea. ‘Why not get married and have done with it?  I  would.’ ‘I don’t mind if I do,’ said the burglar. But the cook said,  ‘No, miss. Not me, not even in a dream. I don’t say anythink ag’in the young chap’s looks, but I always swore I’d be married in church, if at all, and, anyway, I don’t believe these here savages would know how to keep a registering office, even if I was to show them. No, mister, thanking you kindly, if you can’t bring a clergyman into the dream I’ll live and die like what I am.’ ‘Will you marry her if we get a clergyman?’ asked the match-making Anthea. ‘I’m agreeable, miss, I’m sure,’ said he, pulling his wreath straight. ‘’Ow this ‘ere bokay do tiddle a chap’s ears to be sure!’ So, very hurriedly, the carpet was spread out, and instructed to fetch a clergyman. The instructions were written on the inside of Cyril’s cap with a piece of billiard chalk Robert had got from the marker at the hotel at Lyndhurst. The carpet disappeared, and more quickly than you would have thought possible it came back, bearing on its bosom the Reverend Septimus Blenkinsop. The Reverend Septimus was rather a nice young man, but very much mazed and muddled, because when he saw a strange carpet laid out at his feet, in his own study, he naturally walked on it to examine it more closely. And he happened to stand on one of the thin places that Jane and Anthea had darned, so that he was half on wishing carpet and half on plain Scotch heather-mixture fingering, which has no magic properties at all. The effect of this was that he was only half there, so that the children could just see through him, as though he had been a ghost. And as for him, he saw the sunny southern shore, the cook and the burglar and the children quite plainly; but through them all he saw, quite plainly also, his study at home, with the books and the pictures and the marble clock that had been presented to him when he left his last situation. He seemed to himself to be in a sort of insane fit, so that it did not matter what he did, and he married the burglar to the cook. The cook said that she would rather have had a solider kind of a clergyman, one that you couldn’t see through so plain, but perhaps this was real enough for a dream. And of course the clergyman, though misty, was really real, and able to marry people, and he did. When the ceremony was over the clergyman wandered about the island collecting botanical specimens, for he was a great botanist, and the ruling passion was strong even in an insane fit. There was a splendid wedding feast. Can you fancy Jane and Anthea, and Robert and Cyril, dancing merrily in a ring, hand-in-hand with copper-coloured savages, round the happy couple, the queen cook and the burglar consort? There were more flowers gathered and thrown than you have ever even dreamed of, and before the children took carpet for home the now married-and-settled burglar made a speech. ‘Ladies and gentlemen,’ he said, ‘and savages of both kinds, only I know you can’t understand what I’m a saying of, but we’ll let that pass. If this is a dream, I’m on. If it ain’t, I’m onner than ever. If it’s betwixt and between, well, I’m honest, and I can’t say more. I don’t want no more ‘igh London society, I’ve got some one to put my arm around of; and I’ve got the whole lot of this ‘ere island for my allotment, and if I don’t grow some broccoli as’ll open the judge’s eye at the cottage flower shows, well, strike me pink! All I ask is, as these young gents and ladies’ll bring some parsley seed into the dream, and a penn’orth of radish seed, and threepenn’orth of onion, and I wouldn’t mind goin’ to fourpence or fippence for mixed kale, only I ain’t got a brown, so I don’t deceive you. And there’s one thing more, you might take away the parson. I don’t like things what I can see ‘alf through, so here’s how!’ He drained a coconut-shell of palm wine. It was now past midnight, though it was tea-time on the island. With all good wishes the children took their leave. They also collected the clergyman and took him back to his study and his presentation clock. The Phoenix kindly carried the seeds next day to the burglar and his bride, and returned with the most satisfactory news of the happy pair. ‘He’s made a wooden spade and started on his allotment,’ it said, ‘and she is weaving him a shirt and trousers of the most radiant whiteness.’ The police never knew how the burglar got away. In Kentish Town Police Station his escape is still spoken of with bated breath as the Persian mystery. As for the Reverend Septimus Blenkinsop, he felt that he had had a very insane fit indeed, and he was sure it was due to over-study. So he planned a little dissipation, and took his two maiden aunts to Paris, where they enjoyed a dazzling round of museums and picture galleries, and came back feeling that they had indeed seen life. He never told his aunts or any one else about the marriage on the island, because no one likes it to be generally known if he has had insane fits, however interesting and unusual. CHAPTER 10. THE HOLE IN THE CARPET      Hooray! hooray! hooray!      Mother comes home to-day;      Mother comes home to-day,      Hooray! hooray! hooray!’ Jane sang this simple song directly after breakfast, and the Phoenix shed crystal tears of affectionate sympathy. ‘How beautiful,’ it said, ‘is filial devotion!’ ‘She won’t be home till past bedtime, though,’ said Robert. ‘We might have one more carpet-day.’ He was glad that mother was coming home, quite glad, very glad; but at the same time that gladness was rudely contradicted by a quite strong feeling of sorrow, because now they could not go out all day on the carpet. ‘I do wish we could go and get something nice for mother, only she’d want to know where we got it,’ said Anthea. ‘And she’d never, never believe it, the truth. People never do, somehow, if it’s at all interesting.’ ‘I’ll tell you what,’ said Robert. ‘Suppose we wished the carpet to take us somewhere where we could find a purse with money in it, then we could buy her something.’ ‘Suppose it took us somewhere foreign, and the purse was covered with strange Eastern devices, embroidered in rich silks, and full of money that wasn’t money at all here, only foreign curiosities, then we couldn’t spend it, and people would bother about where we got it, and we shouldn’t know how on earth to get out of it at all.’ Cyril moved the table off the carpet as he spoke, and its leg caught in one of Anthea’s darns and ripped away most of it, as well as a large slit in the carpet. ‘Well, now you HAVE done it,’ said Robert. But Anthea was a really first-class sister. She did not say a word till she had got out the Scotch heather-mixture fingering wool and the darning-needle and the thimble and the scissors, and by that time she had been able to get the better of her natural wish to be thoroughly disagreeable, and was able to say quite kindly,  ‘Never mind, Squirrel, I’ll soon mend it.’ Cyril thumped her on the back. He understood exactly how she had felt, and he was not an ungrateful brother. ‘Respecting the purse containing coins,’ the Phoenix said, scratching its invisible ear thoughtfully with its shining claw, ‘it might be as well, perhaps, to state clearly the amount which you wish to find, as well as the country where you wish to find it, and the nature of the coins which you prefer. It would be indeed a cold moment when you should find a purse containing but three oboloi.’ ‘How much is an oboloi?’ ‘An obol is about twopence halfpenny,’ the Phoenix replied. ‘Yes,’ said Jane, ‘and if you find a purse I suppose it is only because some one has lost it, and you ought to take it to the policeman.’ ‘The situation,’ remarked the Phoenix, ‘does indeed bristle with difficulties.’ ‘What about a buried treasure,’ said Cyril, ‘and every one was dead that it belonged to?’ ‘Mother wouldn’t believe THAT,’ said more than one voice. ‘Suppose,’ said Robert, ‘suppose we asked to be taken where we could find a purse and give it back to the person it belonged to, and they would give us something for finding it?’ ‘We aren’t allowed to take money from strangers. You know we aren’t, Bobs,’ said Anthea, making a knot at the end of a needleful of Scotch heather-mixture fingering wool (which is very wrong, and you must never do it when you are darning). ‘No, THAT wouldn’t do,’ said Cyril. ‘Let’s chuck it and go to the North Pole, or somewhere really interesting.’ ‘No,’ said the girls together, ‘there must be SOME way.’ ‘Wait a sec,’ Anthea added. ‘I’ve got an idea coming. Don’t speak.’ There was a silence as she paused with the darning-needle in the air! Suddenly she spoke: ‘I see. Let’s tell the carpet to take us somewhere where we can get the money for mother’s present, and, and, and get it some way that she’ll believe in and not think wrong.’ ‘Well, I must say you are learning the way to get the most out of the carpet,’ said Cyril. He spoke more heartily and kindly than usual, because he remembered how Anthea had refrained from snarking him about tearing the carpet. ‘Yes,’ said the Phoenix, ‘you certainly are. And you have to remember that if you take a thing out it doesn’t stay in.’ No one paid any attention to this remark at the time, but afterwards every one thought of it. ‘Do hurry up, Panther,’ said Robert; and that was why Anthea did hurry up, and why the big darn in the middle of the carpet was all open and webby like a fishing net, not tight and close like woven cloth, which is what a good, well-behaved darn should be. Then every one put on its outdoor things, the Phoenix fluttered on to the mantelpiece and arranged its golden feathers in the glass, and all was ready. Every one got on to the carpet. ‘Please go slowly, dear carpet,’ Anthea began; we like to see where we’re going.’ And then she added the difficult wish that had been decided on. Next moment the carpet, stiff and raftlike, was sailing over the roofs of Kentish Town. ‘I wish, No, I don’t mean that. I mean it’s a PITY we aren’t higher up,’ said Anthea, as the edge of the carpet grazed a chimney-pot. ‘That’s right. Be careful,’ said the Phoenix, in warning tones. ‘If you wish when you’re on a wishing carpet, you DO wish, and there’s an end of it.’ So for a short time no one spoke, and the carpet sailed on in calm magnificence over St Pancras and King’s Cross stations and over the crowded streets of Clerkenwell. ‘We’re going out Greenwich way,’ said Cyril, as they crossed the streak of rough, tumbled water that was the Thames. ‘We might go and have a look at the Palace.’ On and on the carpet swept, still keeping much nearer to the chimney-pots than the children found at all comfortable. And then, just over New Cross, a terrible thing happened. Jane and Robert were in the middle of the carpet. Part of them was on the carpet, and part of them, the heaviest part, was on the great central darn. ‘It’s all very misty,’ said Jane; ‘it looks partly like out of doors and partly like in the nursery at home. I feel as if I was going to have measles; everything looked awfully rum then, remember.’ ‘I feel just exactly the same,’ Robert said. ‘It’s the hole,’ said the Phoenix; ‘it’s not measles whatever that possession may be.’ And at that both Robert and Jane suddenly, and at once, made a bound to try and get on to the safer part of the carpet, and the darn gave way and their boots went up, and the heavy heads and bodies of them went down through the hole, and they landed in a position something between sitting and sprawling on the flat leads on the top of a high, grey, gloomy, respectable house whose address was 705, Amersham Road, New Cross. The carpet seemed to awaken to new energy as soon as it had got rid of their weight, and it rose high in the air. The others lay down flat and peeped over the edge of the rising carpet. ‘Are you hurt?’ cried Cyril, and Robert shouted ‘No,’ and next moment the carpet had sped away, and Jane and Robert were hidden from the sight of the others by a stack of smoky chimneys. ‘Oh, how awful!’ said Anthea. ‘It might have been worse,’ said the Phoenix. ‘What would have been the sentiments of the survivors if that darn had given way when we were crossing the river?’ ‘Yes, there’s that,’ said Cyril, recovering himself. ‘They’ll be all right. They’ll howl till some one gets them down, or drop tiles into the front garden to attract attention of passersby. Bobs has got my one-and-fivepence, lucky you forgot to mend that hole in my pocket, Panther, or he wouldn’t have had it. They can tram it home.’ But Anthea would not be comforted. ‘It’s all my fault,’ she said. ‘I KNEW the proper way to darn, and I didn’t do it. It’s all my fault. Let’s go home and patch the carpet with your Etons, something really strong, and send it to fetch them.’ ‘All right,’ said Cyril; ‘but your Sunday jacket is stronger than my Etons. We must just chuck mother’s present, that’s all. I wish, ’ ‘Stop!’ cried the Phoenix; ‘the carpet is dropping to earth.’ And indeed it was. It sank swiftly, yet steadily, and landed on the pavement of the Deptford Road. It tipped a little as it landed, so that Cyril and Anthea naturally walked off it, and in an instant it had rolled itself up and hidden behind a gate-post. It did this so quickly that not a single person in the Deptford Road noticed it. The Phoenix rustled its way into the breast of Cyril’s coat, and almost at the same moment a well-known voice remarked,  ‘Well, I never! What on earth are you doing here?’ They were face to face with their pet uncle, their Uncle Reginald. ‘We DID think of going to Greenwich Palace and talking about Nelson,’ said Cyril, telling as much of the truth as he thought his uncle could believe. ‘And where are the others?’ asked Uncle Reginald. ‘I don’t exactly know,’ Cyril replied, this time quite truthfully. ‘Well,’ said Uncle Reginald, ‘I must fly. I’ve a case in the County Court. That’s the worst of being a beastly solicitor. One can’t take the chances of life when one gets them. If only I could come with you to the Painted Hall and give you lunch at the “Ship” afterwards! But, alas! it may not be.’ The uncle felt in his pocket. ‘ I  mustn’t enjoy myself,’ he said, ‘but that’s no reason why you shouldn’t. Here, divide this by four, and the product ought to give you some desired result. Take care of yourselves. Adieu.’ And waving a cheery farewell with his neat umbrella, the good and high-hatted uncle passed away, leaving Cyril and Anthea to exchange eloquent glances over the shining golden sovereign that lay in Cyril’s hand. ‘Well!’ said Anthea. ‘Well!’ said Cyril. ‘Well!’ said the Phoenix. ‘Good old carpet!’ said Cyril, joyously. ‘It WAS clever of it, so adequate and yet so simple,’ said the Phoenix, with calm approval. ‘Oh, come on home and let’s mend the carpet. I am a beast. I’d forgotten the others just for a minute,’ said the conscience-stricken Anthea. They unrolled the carpet quickly and slyly, they did not want to attract public attention, and the moment their feet were on the carpet Anthea wished to be at home, and instantly they were. The kindness of their excellent uncle had made it unnecessary for them to go to such extremes as Cyril’s Etons or Anthea’s Sunday jacket for the patching of the carpet. Anthea set to work at once to draw the edges of the broken darn together, and Cyril hastily went out and bought a large piece of the marble-patterned American oil-cloth which careful house-wives use to cover dressers and kitchen tables. It was the strongest thing he could think of. Then they set to work to line the carpet throughout with the oil-cloth. The nursery felt very odd and empty without the others, and Cyril did not feel so sure as he had done about their being able to ‘tram it’ home. So he tried to help Anthea, which was very good of him, but not much use to her. The Phoenix watched them for a time, but it was plainly growing more and more restless. It fluffed up its splendid feathers, and stood first on one gilded claw and then on the other, and at last it said,  ‘I can bear it no longer. This suspense! My Robert, who set my egg to hatch, in the bosom of whose Norfolk raiment I have nestled so often and so pleasantly! I think, if you’ll excuse me, ’ ‘Yes, DO,’ cried Anthea, ‘I wish we’d thought of asking you before.’ Cyril opened the window. The Phoenix flapped its sunbright wings and vanished. ‘So THAT’S all right,’ said Cyril, taking up his needle and instantly pricking his hand in a new place. Of course I know that what you have really wanted to know about all this time is not what Anthea and Cyril did, but what happened to Jane and Robert after they fell through the carpet on to the leads of the house which was called number 705, Amersham Road. But I had to tell you the other first. That is one of the most annoying things about stories, you cannot tell all the different parts of them at the same time. Robert’s first remark when he found himself seated on the damp, cold, sooty leads was,  ‘Here’s a go!’ Jane’s first act was tears. ‘Dry up, Pussy; don’t be a little duffer,’ said her brother, kindly, ‘it’ll be all right.’ And then he looked about, just as Cyril had known he would, for something to throw down, so as to attract the attention of the wayfarers far below in the street. He could not find anything. Curiously enough, there were no stones on the leads, not even a loose tile. The roof was of slate, and every single slate knew its place and kept it. But, as so often happens, in looking for one thing he found another. There was a trap-door leading down into the house. And that trap-door was not fastened. ‘Stop snivelling and come here, Jane,’ he cried, encouragingly. ‘Lend a hand to heave this up. If we can get into the house, we might sneak down without meeting any one, with luck. Come on.’ They heaved up the door till it stood straight up, and, as they bent to look into the hole below, the door fell back with a hollow clang on the leads behind, and with its noise was mingled a blood-curdling scream from underneath. ‘Discovered!’ hissed Robert. ‘Oh, my cats alive!’ They were indeed discovered. They found themselves looking down into an attic, which was also a lumber-room. It had boxes and broken chairs, old fenders and picture-frames, and rag-bags hanging from nails. In the middle of the floor was a box, open, half full of clothes. Other clothes lay on the floor in neat piles. In the middle of the piles of clothes sat a lady, very fat indeed, with her feet sticking out straight in front of her. And it was she who had screamed, and who, in fact, was still screaming. ‘Don’t!’ cried Jane, ‘please don’t! We won’t hurt you.’ ‘Where are the rest of your gang?’ asked the lady, stopping short in the middle of a scream. ‘The others have gone on, on the wishing carpet,’ said Jane truthfully. ‘The wishing carpet?’ said the lady. ‘Yes,’ said Jane, before Robert could say ‘You shut up!’ ‘You must have read about it. The Phoenix is with them.’ Then the lady got up, and picking her way carefully between the piles of clothes she got to the door and through it. She shut it behind her, and the two children could hear her calling ‘Septimus! Septimus!’ in a loud yet frightened way. ‘Now,’ said Robert quickly; ‘I’ll drop first.’ He hung by his hands and dropped through the trap-door. ‘Now you. Hang by your hands. I’ll catch you. Oh, there’s no time for jaw. Drop, I say.’ Jane dropped. Robert tried to catch her, and even before they had finished the breathless roll among the piles of clothes, which was what his catching ended in, he whispered,  ‘We’ll hide, behind those fenders and things; they’ll think we’ve gone along the roofs. Then, when all is calm, we’ll creep down the stairs and take our chance.’ They hastily hid. A corner of an iron bedstead stuck into Robert’s side, and Jane had only standing room for one foot, but they bore it, and when the lady came back, not with Septimus, but with another lady, they held their breath and their hearts beat thickly. ‘Gone!’ said the first lady; ‘poor little things, quite mad, my dear, and at large! We must lock this room and send for the police.’ ‘Let me look out,’ said the second lady, who was, if possible, older and thinner and primmer than the first. So the two ladies dragged a box under the trap-door and put another box on the top of it, and then they both climbed up very carefully and put their two trim, tidy heads out of the trap-door to look for the ‘mad children’. ‘Now,’ whispered Robert, getting the bedstead leg out of his side. They managed to creep out from their hiding-place and out through the door before the two ladies had done looking out of the trap-door on to the empty leads. Robert and Jane tiptoed down the stairs, one flight, two flights. Then they looked over the banisters. Horror! a servant was coming up with a loaded scuttle. The children with one consent crept swiftly through the first open door. The room was a study, calm and gentlemanly, with rows of books, a writing table, and a pair of embroidered slippers warming themselves in the fender. The children hid behind the window-curtains. As they passed the table they saw on it a missionary-box with its bottom label torn off, open and empty. ‘Oh, how awful!’ whispered Jane. ‘We shall never get away alive.’ ‘Hush!’ said Robert, not a moment too soon, for there were steps on the stairs, and next instant the two ladies came into the room. They did not see the children, but they saw the empty missionary box. ‘I knew it,’ said one. ‘Selina, it WAS a gang. I was certain of it from the first. The children were not mad. They were sent to distract our attention while their confederates robbed the house.’ ‘I am afraid you are right,’ said Selina; ‘and WHERE ARE THEY NOW?’ ‘Downstairs, no doubt, collecting the silver milk-jug and sugar-basin and the punch-ladle that was Uncle Joe’s, and Aunt Jerusha’s teaspoons. I shall go down.’ ‘Oh, don’t be so rash and heroic,’ said Selina. ‘Amelia, we must call the police from the window. Lock the door. I WILL, I will, ’ The words ended in a yell as Selina, rushing to the window, came face to face with the hidden children. ‘Oh, don’t!’ said Jane; ‘how can you be so unkind? We AREN’T burglars, and we haven’t any gang, and we didn’t open your missionary-box. We opened our own once, but we didn’t have to use the money, so our consciences made us put it back and, DON’T! Oh, I wish you wouldn’t, ’ Miss Selina had seized Jane and Miss Amelia captured Robert. The children found themselves held fast by strong, slim hands, pink at the wrists and white at the knuckles. ‘We’ve got YOU, at any rate,’ said Miss Amelia. ‘Selina, your captive is smaller than mine. You open the window at once and call “Murder!” as loud as you can. Selina obeyed; but when she had opened the window, instead of calling ‘Murder!’ she called ‘Septimus!’ because at that very moment she saw her nephew coming in at the gate. In another minute he had let himself in with his latch-key and had mounted the stairs. As he came into the room Jane and Robert each uttered a shriek of joy so loud and so sudden that the ladies leaped with surprise, and nearly let them go. ‘It’s our own clergyman,’ cried Jane. ‘Don’t you remember us?’ asked Robert. ‘You married our burglar for us, don’t you remember?’ ‘I KNEW it was a gang,’ said Amelia. ‘Septimus, these abandoned children are members of a desperate burgling gang who are robbing the house. They have already forced the missionary-box and purloined its contents.’ The Reverend Septimus passed his hand wearily over his brow. ‘I feel a little faint,’ he said, ‘running upstairs so quickly.’ ‘We never touched the beastly box,’ said Robert. ‘Then your confederates did,’ said Miss Selina. ‘No, no,’ said the curate, hastily. ‘ I  opened the box myself. This morning I found I had not enough small change for the Mothers’ Independent Unity Measles and Croup Insurance payments. I suppose this is NOT a dream, is it?’ ‘Dream? No, indeed. Search the house. I insist upon it.’ The curate, still pale and trembling, searched the house, which, of course, was blamelessly free of burglars. When he came back he sank wearily into his chair. ‘Aren’t you going to let us go?’ asked Robert, with furious indignation, for there is something in being held by a strong lady that sets the blood of a boy boiling in his veins with anger and despair. ‘We’ve never done anything to you. It’s all the carpet. It dropped us on the leads. WE couldn’t help it. You know how it carried you over to the island, and you had to marry the burglar to the cook.’ ‘Oh, my head!’ said the curate. ‘Never mind your head just now,’ said Robert; ‘try to be honest and honourable, and do your duty in that state of life!’ ‘This is a judgement on me for something, I suppose,’ said the Reverend Septimus, wearily, ‘but I really cannot at the moment remember what.’ ‘Send for the police,’ said Miss Selina. ‘Send for a doctor,’ said the curate. ‘Do you think they ARE mad, then,’ said Miss Amelia. ‘I think I am,’ said the curate. Jane had been crying ever since her capture. Now she said,  ‘You aren’t now, but perhaps you will be, if, And it would serve you jolly well right, too.’ ‘Aunt Selina,’ said the curate, ‘and Aunt Amelia, believe me, this is only an insane dream. You will realize it soon. It has happened to me before. But do not let us be unjust, even in a dream. Do not hold the children; they have done no harm. As I said before, it was I who opened the box.’ The strong, bony hands unwillingly loosened their grasp. Robert shook himself and stood in sulky resentment. But Jane ran to the curate and embraced him so suddenly that he had not time to defend himself. ‘You’re a dear,’ she said. ‘It IS like a dream just at first, but you get used to it. Now DO let us go. There’s a good, kind, honourable clergyman.’ ‘I don’t know,’ said the Reverend Septimus; ‘it’s a difficult problem. It is such a very unusual dream. Perhaps it’s only a sort of other life, quite real enough for you to be mad in. And if you’re mad, there might be a dream-asylum where you’d be kindly treated, and in time restored, cured, to your sorrowing relatives. It is very hard to see your duty plainly, even in ordinary life, and these dream-circumstances are so complicated, ’ ‘If it’s a dream,’ said Robert, ‘you will wake up directly, and then you’d be sorry if you’d sent us into a dream-asylum, because you might never get into the same dream again and let us out, and so we might stay there for ever, and then what about our sorrowing relatives who aren’t in the dreams at all?’ But all the curate could now say was, ‘Oh, my head!’ And Jane and Robert felt quite ill with helplessness and hopelessness. A really conscientious curate is a very difficult thing to manage. And then, just as the hopelessness and the helplessness were getting to be almost more than they could bear, the two children suddenly felt that extraordinary shrinking feeling that you always have when you are just going to vanish. And the next moment they had vanished, and the Reverend Septimus was left alone with his aunts. ‘I knew it was a dream,’ he cried, wildly. ‘I’ve had something like it before. Did you dream it too, Aunt Selina, and you, Aunt Amelia? I dreamed that you did, you know.’ Aunt Selina looked at him and then at Aunt Amelia. Then she said boldly,  ‘What do you mean? WE haven’t been dreaming anything. You must have dropped off in your chair.’ The curate heaved a sigh of relief. ‘Oh, if it’s only  I ,’ he said; ‘if we’d all dreamed it I could never have believed it, never!’ Afterwards Aunt Selina said to the other aunt,  ‘Yes, I know it was an untruth, and I shall doubtless be punished for it in due course. But I could see the poor dear fellow’s brain giving way before my very eyes. He couldn’t have stood the strain of three dreams. It WAS odd, wasn’t it? All three of us dreaming the same thing at the same moment. We must never tell dear Seppy. But I shall send an account of it to the Psychical Society, with stars instead of names, you know.’ And she did. And you can read all about it in one of the society’s fat Blue-books. Of course, you understand what had happened? The intelligent Phoenix had simply gone straight off to the Psammead, and had wished Robert and Jane at home. And, of course, they were at home at once. Cyril and Anthea had not half finished mending the carpet. When the joyful emotions of reunion had calmed down a little, they all went out and spent what was left of Uncle Reginald’s sovereign in presents for mother. They bought her a pink silk handkerchief, a pair of blue and white vases, a bottle of scent, a packet of Christmas candles, and a cake of soap shaped and coloured like a tomato, and one that was so like an orange that almost any one you had given it to would have tried to peel it, if they liked oranges, of course. Also they bought a cake with icing on, and the rest of the money they spent on flowers to put in the vases. When they had arranged all the things on a table, with the candles stuck up on a plate ready to light the moment mother’s cab was heard, they washed themselves thoroughly and put on tidier clothes. Then Robert said, ‘Good old Psammead,’ and the others said so too. ‘But, really, it’s just as much good old Phoenix,’ said Robert. ‘Suppose it hadn’t thought of getting the wish!’ ‘Ah!’ said the Phoenix, ‘it is perhaps fortunate for you that I am such a competent bird.’ ‘There’s mother’s cab,’ cried Anthea, and the Phoenix hid and they lighted the candles, and next moment mother was home again. She liked her presents very much, and found their story of Uncle Reginald and the sovereign easy and even pleasant to believe. ‘Good old carpet,’ were Cyril’s last sleepy words. ‘What there is of it,’ said the Phoenix, from the cornice-pole. CHAPTER 11. THE BEGINNING OF THE END ‘Well, I MUST say,’ mother said, looking at the wishing carpet as it lay, all darned and mended and backed with shiny American cloth, on the floor of the nursery, ‘I MUST say I’ve never in my life bought such a bad bargain as that carpet.’ A soft ‘Oh!’ of contradiction sprang to the lips of Cyril, Robert, Jane, and Anthea. Mother looked at them quickly, and said,  ‘Well, of course, I see you’ve mended it very nicely, and that was sweet of you, dears.’ ‘The boys helped too,’ said the dears, honourably. ‘But, still, twenty-two and ninepence! It ought to have lasted for years. It’s simply dreadful now. Well, never mind, darlings, you’ve done your best. I think we’ll have coconut matting next time. A carpet doesn’t have an easy life of it in this room, does it?’ ‘It’s not our fault, mother, is it, that our boots are the really reliable kind?’ Robert asked the question more in sorrow than in anger. ‘No, dear, we can’t help our boots,’ said mother, cheerfully, ‘but we might change them when we come in, perhaps. It’s just an idea of mine. I wouldn’t dream of scolding on the very first morning after I’ve come home. Oh, my Lamb, how could you?’ This conversation was at breakfast, and the Lamb had been beautifully good until every one was looking at the carpet, and then it was for him but the work of a moment to turn a glass dish of syrupy blackberry jam upside down on his young head. It was the work of a good many minutes and several persons to get the jam off him again, and this interesting work took people’s minds off the carpet, and nothing more was said just then about its badness as a bargain and about what mother hoped for from coconut matting. When the Lamb was clean again he had to be taken care of while mother rumpled her hair and inked her fingers and made her head ache over the difficult and twisted house-keeping accounts which cook gave her on dirty bits of paper, and which were supposed to explain how it was that cook had only fivepence-half-penny and a lot of unpaid bills left out of all the money mother had sent her for house-keeping. Mother was very clever, but even she could not quite understand the cook’s accounts. The Lamb was very glad to have his brothers and sisters to play with him. He had not forgotten them a bit, and he made them play all the old exhausting games: ‘Whirling Worlds’, where you swing the baby round and round by his hands; and ‘Leg and Wing’, where you swing him from side to side by one ankle and one wrist. There was also climbing Vesuvius. In this game the baby walks up you, and when he is standing on your shoulders, you shout as loud as you can, which is the rumbling of the burning mountain, and then tumble him gently on to the floor, and roll him there, which is the destruction of Pompeii. ‘All the same, I wish we could decide what we’d better say next time mother says anything about the carpet,’ said Cyril, breathlessly ceasing to be a burning mountain. ‘Well, you talk and decide,’ said Anthea; ‘here, you lovely ducky Lamb. Come to Panther and play Noah’s Ark.’ The Lamb came with his pretty hair all tumbled and his face all dusty from the destruction of Pompeii, and instantly became a baby snake, hissing and wriggling and creeping in Anthea’s arms, as she said,       ‘I love my little baby snake,      He hisses when he is awake,      He creeps with such a wriggly creep,      He wriggles even in his sleep.’ ‘Crocky,’ said the Lamb, and showed all his little teeth. So Anthea went on,       ‘I love my little crocodile,      I love his truthful toothful smile;      It is so wonderful and wide,      I like to see it, FROM OUTSIDE.’ ‘Well, you see,’ Cyril was saying; ‘it’s just the old bother. Mother can’t believe the real true truth about the carpet, and, ’ ‘You speak sooth, O Cyril,’ remarked the Phoenix, coming out from the cupboard where the blackbeetles lived, and the torn books, and the broken slates, and odd pieces of toys that had lost the rest of themselves. ‘Now hear the wisdom of Phoenix, the son of the Phoenix, ’ ‘There is a society called that,’ said Cyril. ‘Where is it? And what is a society?’ asked the bird. ‘It’s a sort of joined-together lot of people, a sort of brotherhood, a kind of, well, something very like your temple, you know, only quite different.’ ‘I take your meaning,’ said the Phoenix. ‘I would fain see these calling themselves Sons of the Phoenix.’ ‘But what about your words of wisdom?’ ‘Wisdom is always welcome,’ said the Phoenix. ‘Pretty Polly!’ remarked the Lamb, reaching his hands towards the golden speaker. The Phoenix modestly retreated behind Robert, and Anthea hastened to distract the attention of the Lamb by murmuring,       “I love my little baby rabbit;      But oh! he has a dreadful habit      Of paddling out among the rocks      And soaking both his bunny socks.’ ‘I don’t think you’d care about the sons of the Phoenix, really,’ said Robert. ‘I have heard that they don’t do anything fiery. They only drink a great deal. Much more than other people, because they drink lemonade and fizzy things, and the more you drink of those the more good you get.’ ‘In your mind, perhaps,’ said Jane; ‘but it wouldn’t be good in your body. You’d get too balloony.’ The Phoenix yawned. ‘Look here,’ said Anthea; ‘I really have an idea. This isn’t like a common carpet. It’s very magic indeed. Don’t you think, if we put Tatcho on it, and then gave it a rest, the magic part of it might grow, like hair is supposed to do?’ ‘It might,’ said Robert; ‘but I should think paraffin would do as well, at any rate as far as the smell goes, and that seems to be the great thing about Tatcho.’ But with all its faults Anthea’s idea was something to do, and they did it. It was Cyril who fetched the Tatcho bottle from father’s washhand-stand. But the bottle had not much in it. ‘We mustn’t take it all,’ Jane said, ‘in case father’s hair began to come off suddenly. If he hadn’t anything to put on it, it might all drop off before Eliza had time to get round to the chemist’s for another bottle. It would be dreadful to have a bald father, and it would all be our fault.’ ‘And wigs are very expensive, I believe,’ said Anthea. ‘Look here, leave enough in the bottle to wet father’s head all over with in case any emergency emerges, and let’s make up with paraffin. I expect it’s the smell that does the good really, and the smell’s exactly the same.’ So a small teaspoonful of the Tatcho was put on the edges of the worst darn in the carpet and rubbed carefully into the roots of the hairs of it, and all the parts that there was not enough Tatcho for had paraffin rubbed into them with a piece of flannel. Then the flannel was burned. It made a gay flame, which delighted the Phoenix and the Lamb. ‘How often,’ said mother, opening the door, ‘how often am I to tell you that you are NOT to play with paraffin? What have you been doing?’ ‘We have burnt a paraffiny rag,’ Anthea answered. It was no use telling mother what they had done to the carpet. She did not know it was a magic carpet, and no one wants to be laughed at for trying to mend an ordinary carpet with lamp-oil. ‘Well, don’t do it again,’ said mother. ‘And now, away with melancholy! Father has sent a telegram. Look!’ She held it out, and the children, holding it by its yielding corners, read,  ‘Box for kiddies at Garrick. Stalls for us, Haymarket. Meet Charing Cross, 6.30.’ ‘That means,’ said mother, ‘that you’re going to see “The Water Babies”  all by your happy selves, and father and I will take you and fetch you. Give me the Lamb, dear, and you and Jane put clean lace in your red evening frocks, and I shouldn’t wonder if you found they wanted ironing. This paraffin smell is ghastly. Run and get out your frocks.’ The frocks did want ironing, wanted it rather badly, as it happened; for, being of tomato-Coloured Liberty silk, they had been found very useful for tableaux vivants when a red dress was required for Cardinal Richelieu. They were very nice tableaux, these, and I wish I could tell you about them; but one cannot tell everything in a story. You would have been specially interested in hearing about the tableau of the Princes in the Tower, when one of the pillows burst, and the youthful Princes were so covered with feathers that the picture might very well have been called ‘Michaelmas Eve; or, Plucking the Geese’. Ironing the dresses and sewing the lace in occupied some time, and no one was dull, because there was the theatre to look forward to, and also the possible growth of hairs on the carpet, for which every one kept looking anxiously. By four o’clock Jane was almost sure that several hairs were beginning to grow. The Phoenix perched on the fender, and its conversation, as usual, was entertaining and instructive, like school prizes are said to be. But it seemed a little absent-minded, and even a little sad. ‘Don’t you feel well, Phoenix, dear?’ asked Anthea, stooping to take an iron off the fire. ‘I am not sick,’ replied the golden bird, with a gloomy shake of the head; ‘but I am getting old.’ ‘Why, you’ve hardly been hatched any time at all.’ ‘Time,’ remarked the Phoenix, ‘is measured by heartbeats. I’m sure the palpitations I’ve had since I’ve known you are enough to blanch the feathers of any bird.’ ‘But I thought you lived 500 years,’ said Robert, and you’ve hardly begun this set of years. Think of all the time that’s before you.’ ‘Time,’ said the Phoenix, ‘is, as you are probably aware, merely a convenient fiction. There is no such thing as time. I have lived in these two months at a pace which generously counterbalances 500 years of life in the desert. I am old, I am weary. I feel as if I ought to lay my egg, and lay me down to my fiery sleep. But unless I’m careful I shall be hatched again instantly, and that is a misfortune which I really do not think I COULD endure. But do not let me intrude these desperate personal reflections on your youthful happiness. What is the show at the theatre to-night? Wrestlers? Gladiators? A combat of cameleopards and unicorns?’ ‘I don’t think so,’ said Cyril; ‘it’s called “The Water Babies”, and if it’s like the book there isn’t any gladiating in it. There are chimney-sweeps and professors, and a lobster and an otter and a salmon, and children living in the water.’ ‘It sounds chilly.’ The Phoenix shivered, and went to sit on the tongs. ‘I don’t suppose there will be REAL water,’ said Jane. ‘And theatres are very warm and pretty, with a lot of gold and lamps. Wouldn’t you like to come with us?’ ‘ I  was just going to say that,’ said Robert, in injured tones, ‘only I know how rude it is to interrupt. Do come, Phoenix, old chap; it will cheer you up. It’ll make you laugh like any thing. Mr Bourchier always makes ripping plays. You ought to have seen “Shock-headed Peter” last year.’ ‘Your words are strange,’ said the Phoenix, ‘but I will come with you. The revels of this Bourchier, of whom you speak, may help me to forget the weight of my years.’ So that evening the Phoenix snugged inside the waistcoat of Robert’s Etons, a very tight fit it seemed both to Robert and to the Phoenix, and was taken to the play. Robert had to pretend to be cold at the glittering, many-mirrored restaurant where they ate dinner, with father in evening dress, with a very shiny white shirt-front, and mother looking lovely in her grey evening dress, that changes into pink and green when she moves. Robert pretended that he was too cold to take off his great-coat, and so sat sweltering through what would otherwise have been a most thrilling meal. He felt that he was a blot on the smart beauty of the family, and he hoped the Phoenix knew what he was suffering for its sake. Of course, we are all pleased to suffer for the sake of others, but we like them to know it unless we are the very best and noblest kind of people, and Robert was just ordinary. Father was full of jokes and fun, and every one laughed all the time, even with their mouths full, which is not manners. Robert thought father would not have been quite so funny about his keeping his over-coat on if father had known all the truth. And there Robert was probably right. When dinner was finished to the last grape and the last paddle in the finger glasses, for it was a really truly grown-up dinner, the children were taken to the theatre, guided to a box close to the stage, and left. Father’s parting words were: ‘Now, don’t you stir out of this box, whatever you do. I shall be back before the end of the play. Be good and you will be happy. Is this zone torrid enough for the abandonment of great-coats, Bobs? No? Well, then, I should say you were sickening for something, mumps or measles or thrush or teething. Goodbye.’ He went, and Robert was at last able to remove his coat, mop his perspiring brow, and release the crushed and dishevelled Phoenix. Robert had to arrange his damp hair at the looking-glass at the back of the box, and the Phoenix had to preen its disordered feathers for some time before either of them was fit to be seen. They were very, very early. When the lights went up fully, the Phoenix, balancing itself on the gilded back of a chair, swayed in ecstasy. ‘How fair a scene is this!’ it murmured; ‘how far fairer than my temple! Or have I guessed aright? Have you brought me hither to lift up my heart with emotions of joyous surprise? Tell me, my Robert, is it not that this, THIS is my true temple, and the other was but a humble shrine frequented by outcasts?’ ‘I don’t know about outcasts,’ said Robert, ‘but you can call this your temple if you like. Hush! the music is beginning.’ I am not going to tell you about the play. As I said before, one can’t tell everything, and no doubt you saw ‘The Water Babies’ yourselves. If you did not it was a shame, or, rather, a pity. What I must tell you is that, though Cyril and Jane and Robert and Anthea enjoyed it as much as any children possibly could, the pleasure of the Phoenix was far, far greater than theirs. ‘This is indeed my temple,’ it said again and again. ‘What radiant rites! And all to do honour to me!’ The songs in the play it took to be hymns in its honour. The choruses were choric songs in its praise. The electric lights, it said, were magic torches lighted for its sake, and it was so charmed with the footlights that the children could hardly persuade it to sit still. But when the limelight was shown it could contain its approval no longer. It flapped its golden wings, and cried in a voice that could be heard all over the theatre: ‘Well done, my servants! Ye have my favour and my countenance!’ Little Tom on the stage stopped short in what he was saying. A deep breath was drawn by hundreds of lungs, every eye in the house turned to the box where the luckless children cringed, and most people hissed, or said ‘Shish!’ or ‘Turn them out!’ Then the play went on, and an attendant presently came to the box and spoke wrathfully. ‘It wasn’t us, indeed it wasn’t,’ said Anthea, earnestly; ‘it was the bird.’ The man said well, then, they must keep their bird very quiet. ‘Disturbing every one like this,’ he said. ‘It won’t do it again,’ said Robert, glancing imploringly at the golden bird; ‘I’m sure it won’t.’ ‘You have my leave to depart,’ said the Phoenix gently. ‘Well, he is a beauty, and no mistake,’ said the attendant, ‘only I’d cover him up during the acts. It upsets the performance.’ And he went. ‘Don’t speak again, there’s a dear,’ said Anthea; ‘you wouldn’t like to interfere with your own temple, would you?’ So now the Phoenix was quiet, but it kept whispering to the children. It wanted to know why there was no altar, no fire, no incense, and became so excited and fretful and tiresome that four at least of the party of five wished deeply that it had been left at home. What happened next was entirely the fault of the Phoenix. It was not in the least the fault of the theatre people, and no one could ever understand afterwards how it did happen. No one, that is, except the guilty bird itself and the four children. The Phoenix was balancing itself on the gilt back of the chair, swaying backwards and forwards and up and down, as you may see your own domestic parrot do. I mean the grey one with the red tail. All eyes were on the stage, where the lobster was delighting the audience with that gem of a song, ‘If you can’t walk straight, walk sideways!’ when the Phoenix murmured warmly,  ‘No altar, no fire, no incense!’ and then, before any of the children could even begin to think of stopping it, it spread its bright wings and swept round the theatre, brushing its gleaming feathers against delicate hangings and gilded woodwork. It seemed to have made but one circular wing-sweep, such as you may see a gull make over grey water on a stormy day. Next moment it was perched again on the chair-back, and all round the theatre, where it had passed, little sparks shone like tinsel seeds, then little smoke wreaths curled up like growing plants, little flames opened like flower-buds. People whispered, then people shrieked. ‘Fire! Fire!’ The curtain went down, the lights went up. ‘Fire!’ cried every one, and made for the doors. ‘A magnificent idea!’ said the Phoenix, complacently. ‘An enormous altar, fire supplied free of charge. Doesn’t the incense smell delicious?’ The only smell was the stifling smell of smoke, of burning silk, or scorching varnish. The little flames had opened now into great flame-flowers. The people in the theatre were shouting and pressing towards the doors. ‘Oh, how COULD you!’ cried Jane. ‘Let’s get out.’ ‘Father said stay here,’ said Anthea, very pale, and trying to speak in her ordinary voice. ‘He didn’t mean stay and be roasted,’ said Robert. ‘No boys on burning decks for me, thank you.’ ‘Not much,’ said Cyril, and he opened the door of the box. But a fierce waft of smoke and hot air made him shut it again. It was not possible to get out that way. They looked over the front of the box. Could they climb down? It would be possible, certainly; but would they be much better off? ‘Look at the people,’ moaned Anthea; ‘we couldn’t get through.’ And, indeed, the crowd round the doors looked as thick as flies in the jam-making season. ‘I wish we’d never seen the Phoenix,’ cried Jane. Even at that awful moment Robert looked round to see if the bird had overheard a speech which, however natural, was hardly polite or grateful. The Phoenix was gone. ‘Look here,’ said Cyril, ‘I’ve read about fires in papers; I’m sure it’s all right. Let’s wait here, as father said.’ ‘We can’t do anything else,’ said Anthea bitterly. ‘Look here,’ said Robert, ‘I’m NOT frightened, no, I’m not. The Phoenix has never been a skunk yet, and I’m certain it’ll see us through somehow. I believe in the Phoenix!’ ‘The Phoenix thanks you, O Robert,’ said a golden voice at his feet, and there was the Phoenix itself, on the Wishing Carpet. ‘Quick!’ it said. ‘Stand on those portions of the carpet which are truly antique and authentic, and, ’ A sudden jet of flame stopped its words. Alas! the Phoenix had unconsciously warmed to its subject, and in the unintentional heat of the moment had set fire to the paraffin with which that morning the children had anointed the carpet. It burned merrily. The children tried in vain to stamp it out. They had to stand back and let it burn itself out. When the paraffin had burned away it was found that it had taken with it all the darns of Scotch heather-mixture fingering. Only the fabric of the old carpet was left, and that was full of holes. ‘Come,’ said the Phoenix, ‘I’m cool now.’ The four children got on to what was left of the carpet. Very careful they were not to leave a leg or a hand hanging over one of the holes. It was very hot, the theatre was a pit of fire. Every one else had got out. Jane had to sit on Anthea’s lap. ‘Home!’ said Cyril, and instantly the cool draught from under the nursery door played upon their legs as they sat. They were all on the carpet still, and the carpet was lying in its proper place on the nursery floor, as calm and unmoved as though it had never been to the theatre or taken part in a fire in its life. Four long breaths of deep relief were instantly breathed. The draught which they had never liked before was for the moment quite pleasant. And they were safe. And every one else was safe. The theatre had been quite empty when they left. Every one was sure of that. They presently found themselves all talking at once. Somehow none of their adventures had given them so much to talk about. None other had seemed so real. ‘Did you notice, ?’ they said, and ‘Do you remember, ?’ When suddenly Anthea’s face turned pale under the dirt which it had collected on it during the fire. ‘Oh,’ she cried, ‘mother and father! Oh, how awful! They’ll think we’re burned to cinders. Oh, let’s go this minute and tell them we aren’t.’ ‘We should only miss them,’ said the sensible Cyril. ‘Well, YOU go then,’ said Anthea, ‘or I will. Only do wash your face first. Mother will be sure to think you are burnt to a cinder if she sees you as black as that, and she’ll faint or be ill or something. Oh, I wish we’d never got to know that Phoenix.’ ‘Hush!’ said Robert; ‘it’s no use being rude to the bird. I suppose it can’t help its nature. Perhaps we’d better wash too. Now I come to think of it my hands are rather, ’ No one had noticed the Phoenix since it had bidden them to step on the carpet. And no one noticed that no one had noticed. All were partially clean, and Cyril was just plunging into his great-coat to go and look for his parents, he, and not unjustly, called it looking for a needle in a bundle of hay, when the sound of father’s latchkey in the front door sent every one bounding up the stairs. ‘Are you all safe?’ cried mother’s voice; ‘are you all safe?’ and the next moment she was kneeling on the linoleum of the hall, trying to kiss four damp children at once, and laughing and crying by turns, while father stood looking on and saying he was blessed or something. ‘But how did you guess we’d come home,’ said Cyril, later, when every one was calm enough for talking. ‘Well, it was rather a rum thing. We heard the Garrick was on fire, and of course we went straight there,’ said father, briskly. ‘We couldn’t find you, of course, and we couldn’t get in, but the firemen told us every one was safely out. And then I heard a voice at my ear say, “Cyril, Anthea, Robert, and Jane”, and something touched me on the shoulder. It was a great yellow pigeon, and it got in the way of my seeing who’d spoken. It fluttered off, and then some one said in the other ear, “They’re safe at home”; and when I turned again, to see who it was speaking, hanged if there wasn’t that confounded pigeon on my other shoulder. Dazed by the fire, I suppose. Your mother said it was the voice of, ’ ‘I said it was the bird that spoke,’ said mother, ‘and so it was. Or at least I thought so then. It wasn’t a pigeon. It was an orange-coloured cockatoo. I don’t care who it was that spoke. It was true and you’re safe.’ Mother began to cry again, and father said bed was a good place after the pleasures of the stage. So every one went there. Robert had a talk to the Phoenix that night. ‘Oh, very well,’ said the bird, when Robert had said what he felt, ‘didn’t you know that I had power over fire? Do not distress yourself. I, like my high priests in Lombard Street, can undo the work of flames. Kindly open the casement.’ It flew out. That was why the papers said next day that the fire at the theatre had done less damage than had been anticipated. As a matter of fact it had done none, for the Phoenix spent the night in putting things straight. How the management accounted for this, and how many of the theatre officials still believe that they were mad on that night will never be known. Next day mother saw the burnt holes in the carpet. ‘It caught where it was paraffiny,’ said Anthea. ‘I must get rid of that carpet at once,’ said mother. But what the children said in sad whispers to each other, as they pondered over last night’s events, was,  ‘We must get rid of that Phoenix.’ CHAPTER 12. THE END OF THE END ‘Egg, toast, tea, milk, tea-cup and saucer, egg-spoon, knife, butter, that’s all, I think,’ remarked Anthea, as she put the last touches to mother’s breakfast-tray, and went, very carefully up the stairs, feeling for every step with her toes, and holding on to the tray with all her fingers. She crept into mother’s room and set the tray on a chair. Then she pulled one of the blinds up very softly. ‘Is your head better, mammy dear?’ she asked, in the soft little voice that she kept expressly for mother’s headaches. ‘I’ve brought your brekkie, and I’ve put the little cloth with clover-leaves on it, the one I made you.’ ‘That’s very nice,’ said mother sleepily. Anthea knew exactly what to do for mothers with headaches who had breakfast in bed. She fetched warm water and put just enough eau de Cologne in it, and bathed mother’s face and hands with the sweet-scented water. Then mother was able to think about breakfast. ‘But what’s the matter with my girl?’ she asked, when her eyes got used to the light. ‘Oh, I’m so sorry you’re ill,’ Anthea said. ‘It’s that horrible fire and you being so frightened. Father said so. And we all feel as if it was our faults. I can’t explain, but, ’ ‘It wasn’t your fault a bit, you darling goosie,’ mother said. ‘How could it be?’ ‘That’s just what I can’t tell you,’ said Anthea. ‘I haven’t got a futile brain like you and father, to think of ways of explaining everything.’ Mother laughed. ‘My futile brain, or did you mean fertile?, anyway, it feels very stiff and sore this morning, but I shall be quite all right by and by. And don’t be a silly little pet girl. The fire wasn’t your faults. No; I don’t want the egg, dear. I’ll go to sleep again, I think. Don’t you worry. And tell cook not to bother me about meals. You can order what you like for lunch.’ Anthea closed the door very mousily, and instantly went downstairs and ordered what she liked for lunch. She ordered a pair of turkeys, a large plum-pudding, cheese-cakes, and almonds and raisins. Cook told her to go along, do. And she might as well not have ordered anything, for when lunch came it was just hashed mutton and semolina pudding, and cook had forgotten the sippets for the mutton hash and the semolina pudding was burnt. When Anthea rejoined the others she found them all plunged in the gloom where she was herself. For every one knew that the days of the carpet were now numbered. Indeed, so worn was it that you could almost have numbered its threads. So that now, after nearly a month of magic happenings, the time was at hand when life would have to go on in the dull, ordinary way and Jane, Robert, Anthea, and Cyril would be just in the same position as the other children who live in Camden Town, the children whom these four had so often pitied, and perhaps a little despised. ‘We shall be just like them,’ Cyril said. ‘Except,’ said Robert, ‘that we shall have more things to remember and be sorry we haven’t got.’ ‘Mother’s going to send away the carpet as soon as she’s well enough to see about that coconut matting. Fancy us with coconut-matting, us! And we’ve walked under live coconut-trees on the island where you can’t have whooping-cough.’ ‘Pretty island,’ said the Lamb; ‘paint-box sands and sea all shiny sparkly.’ His brothers and sisters had often wondered whether he remembered that island. Now they knew that he did. ‘Yes,’ said Cyril; ‘no more cheap return trips by carpet for us, that’s a dead cert.’ They were all talking about the carpet, but what they were all thinking about was the Phoenix. The golden bird had been so kind, so friendly, so polite, so instructive, and now it had set fire to a theatre and made mother ill. Nobody blamed the bird. It had acted in a perfectly natural manner. But every one saw that it must not be asked to prolong its visit. Indeed, in plain English it must be asked to go! The four children felt like base spies and treacherous friends; and each in its mind was saying who ought not to be the one to tell the Phoenix that there could no longer be a place for it in that happy home in Camden Town. Each child was quite sure that one of them ought to speak out in a fair and manly way, but nobody wanted to be the one. They could not talk the whole thing over as they would have liked to do, because the Phoenix itself was in the cupboard, among the blackbeetles and the odd shoes and the broken chessmen. But Anthea tried. ‘It’s very horrid. I do hate thinking things about people, and not being able to say the things you’re thinking because of the way they would feel when they thought what things you were thinking, and wondered what they’d done to make you think things like that, and why you were thinking them.’ Anthea was so anxious that the Phoenix should not understand what she said that she made a speech completely baffling to all. It was not till she pointed to the cupboard in which all believed the Phoenix to be that Cyril understood. ‘Yes,’ he said, while Jane and Robert were trying to tell each other how deeply they didn’t understand what Anthea were saying; ‘but after recent eventfulnesses a new leaf has to be turned over, and, after all, mother is more important than the feelings of any of the lower forms of creation, however unnatural.’ ‘How beautifully you do do it,’ said Anthea, absently beginning to build a card-house for the Lamb, ‘mixing up what you’re saying, I mean. We ought to practise doing it so as to be ready for mysterious occasions. We’re talking about THAT,’ she said to Jane and Robert, frowning, and nodding towards the cupboard where the Phoenix was. Then Robert and Jane understood, and each opened its mouth to speak. ‘Wait a minute,’ said Anthea quickly; ‘the game is to twist up what you want to say so that no one can understand what you’re saying except the people you want to understand it, and sometimes not them.’ ‘The ancient philosophers,’ said a golden voice, ‘Well understood the art of which you speak.’ Of course it was the Phoenix, who had not been in the cupboard at all, but had been cocking a golden eye at them from the cornice during the whole conversation. ‘Pretty dickie!’ remarked the Lamb. ‘CANARY dickie!’ ‘Poor misguided infant,’ said the Phoenix. There was a painful pause; the four could not but think it likely that the Phoenix had understood their very veiled allusions, accompanied as they had been by gestures indicating the cupboard. For the Phoenix was not wanting in intelligence. ‘We were just saying, ’ Cyril began, and I hope he was not going to say anything but the truth. Whatever it was he did not say it, for the Phoenix interrupted him, and all breathed more freely as it spoke. ‘I gather,’ it said, ‘that you have some tidings of a fatal nature to communicate to our degraded black brothers who run to and fro for ever yonder.’ It pointed a claw at the cupboard, where the blackbeetles lived. ‘Canary TALK,’ said the Lamb joyously; ‘go and show mammy.’ He wriggled off Anthea’s lap. ‘Mammy’s asleep,’ said Jane, hastily. ‘Come and be wild beasts in a cage under the table.’ But the Lamb caught his feet and hands, and even his head, so often and so deeply in the holes of the carpet that the cage, or table, had to be moved on to the linoleum, and the carpet lay bare to sight with all its horrid holes. ‘Ah,’ said the bird, ‘it isn’t long for this world.’ ‘No,’ said Robert; ‘everything comes to an end. It’s awful.’ ‘Sometimes the end is peace,’ remarked the Phoenix. ‘I imagine that unless it comes soon the end of your carpet will be pieces.’ ‘Yes,’ said Cyril, respectfully kicking what was left of the carpet. The movement of its bright colours caught the eye of the Lamb, who went down on all fours instantly and began to pull at the red and blue threads. ‘Aggedydaggedygaggedy,’ murmured the Lamb; ‘daggedy ag ag ag!’ And before any one could have winked (even if they had wanted to, and it would not have been of the slightest use) the middle of the floor showed bare, an island of boards surrounded by a sea of linoleum. The magic carpet was gone, AND SO WAS THE LAMB! There was a horrible silence. The Lamb, the baby, all alone, had been wafted away on that untrustworthy carpet, so full of holes and magic. And no one could know where he was. And no one could follow him because there was now no carpet to follow on. Jane burst into tears, but Anthea, though pale and frantic, was dry-eyed. ‘It MUST be a dream,’ she said. ‘That’s what the clergyman said,’ remarked Robert forlornly; ‘but it wasn’t, and it isn’t.’ ‘But the Lamb never wished,’ said Cyril; ‘he was only talking Bosh.’ ‘The carpet understands all speech,’ said the Phoenix, ‘even Bosh. I know not this Boshland, but be assured that its tongue is not unknown to the carpet.’ ‘Do you mean, then,’ said Anthea, in white terror, ‘that when he was saying “Agglety dag,” or whatever it was, that he meant something by it?’ ‘All speech has meaning,’ said the Phoenix. ‘There I think you’re wrong,’ said Cyril; ‘even people who talk English sometimes say things that don’t mean anything in particular.’ ‘Oh, never mind that now,’ moaned Anthea; ‘you think “Aggety dag” meant something to him and the carpet?’ ‘Beyond doubt it held the same meaning to the carpet as to the luckless infant,’ the Phoenix said calmly. ‘And WHAT did it mean? Oh WHAT?’ ‘Unfortunately,’ the bird rejoined, ‘I never studied Bosh.’ Jane sobbed noisily, but the others were calm with what is sometimes called the calmness of despair. The Lamb was gone, the Lamb, their own precious baby brother, who had never in his happy little life been for a moment out of the sight of eyes that loved him, he was gone. He had gone alone into the great world with no other companion and protector than a carpet with holes in it. The children had never really understood before what an enormously big place the world is. And the Lamb might be anywhere in it! ‘And it’s no use going to look for him.’ Cyril, in flat and wretched tones, only said what the others were thinking. ‘Do you wish him to return?’ the Phoenix asked; it seemed to speak with some surprise. ‘Of course we do!’ cried everybody. ‘Isn’t he more trouble than he’s worth?’ asked the bird doubtfully. ‘No, no. Oh, we do want him back! We do!’ ‘Then,’ said the wearer of gold plumage, ‘if you’ll excuse me, I’ll just pop out and see what I can do.’ Cyril flung open the window, and the Phoenix popped out. ‘Oh, if only mother goes on sleeping! Oh, suppose she wakes up and wants the Lamb! Oh, suppose the servants come! Stop crying, Jane. It’s no earthly good. No, I’m not crying myself, at least I wasn’t till you said so, and I shouldn’t anyway if, if there was any mortal thing we could do. Oh, oh, oh!’ Cyril and Robert were boys, and boys never cry, of course. Still, the position was a terrible one, and I do not wonder that they made faces in their efforts to behave in a really manly way. And at this awful moment mother’s bell rang. A breathless stillness held the children. Then Anthea dried her eyes. She looked round her and caught up the poker. She held it out to Cyril. ‘Hit my hand hard,’ she said; ‘I must show mother some reason for my eyes being like they are. Harder,’ she cried as Cyril gently tapped her with the iron handle. And Cyril, agitated and trembling, nerved himself to hit harder, and hit very much harder than he intended. Anthea screamed. ‘Oh, Panther, I didn’t mean to hurt, really,’ cried Cyril, clattering the poker back into the fender. ‘It’s, all, right,’ said Anthea breathlessly, clasping the hurt hand with the one that wasn’t hurt; ‘it’s, getting, red.’ It was, a round red and blue bump was rising on the back of it. ‘Now, Robert,’ she said, trying to breathe more evenly, ‘you go out, oh, I don’t know where, on to the dustbin, anywhere, and I shall tell mother you and the Lamb are out.’ Anthea was now ready to deceive her mother for as long as ever she could. Deceit is very wrong, we know, but it seemed to Anthea that it was her plain duty to keep her mother from being frightened about the Lamb as long as possible. And the Phoenix might help. ‘It always has helped,’ Robert said; ‘it got us out of the tower, and even when it made the fire in the theatre it got us out all right. I’m certain it will manage somehow.’ Mother’s bell rang again. ‘Oh, Eliza’s never answered it,’ cried Anthea; ‘she never does. Oh, I must go.’ And she went. Her heart beat bumpingly as she climbed the stairs. Mother would be certain to notice her eyes, well, her hand would account for that. But the Lamb,  ‘No, I must NOT think of the Lamb, she said to herself, and bit her tongue till her eyes watered again, so as to give herself something else to think of. Her arms and legs and back, and even her tear-reddened face, felt stiff with her resolution not to let mother be worried if she could help it. She opened the door softly. ‘Yes, mother?’ she said. ‘Dearest,’ said mother, ‘the Lamb, ’ Anthea tried to be brave. She tried to say that the Lamb and Robert were out. Perhaps she tried too hard. Anyway, when she opened her mouth no words came. So she stood with it open. It seemed easier to keep from crying with one’s mouth in that unusual position. ‘The Lamb,’ mother went on; ‘he was very good at first, but he’s pulled the toilet-cover off the dressing-table with all the brushes and pots and things, and now he’s so quiet I’m sure he’s in some dreadful mischief. And I can’t see him from here, and if I’d got out of bed to see I’m sure I should have fainted.’ ‘Do you mean he’s HERE?’ said Anthea. ‘Of course he’s here,’ said mother, a little impatiently. ‘Where did you think he was?’ Anthea went round the foot of the big mahogany bed. There was a pause. ‘He’s not here NOW,’ she said. That he had been there was plain, from the toilet-cover on the floor, the scattered pots and bottles, the wandering brushes and combs, all involved in the tangle of ribbons and laces which an open drawer had yielded to the baby’s inquisitive fingers. ‘He must have crept out, then,’ said mother; ‘do keep him with you, there’s a darling. If I don’t get some sleep I shall be a wreck when father comes home.’ Anthea closed the door softly. Then she tore downstairs and burst into the nursery, crying,  ‘He must have wished he was with mother. He’s been there all the time. “Aggety dag, “’ The unusual word was frozen on her lip, as people say in books. For there, on the floor, lay the carpet, and on the carpet, surrounded by his brothers and by Jane, sat the Lamb. He had covered his face and clothes with vaseline and violet powder, but he was easily recognizable in spite of this disguise. ‘You are right,’ said the Phoenix, who was also present; ‘it is evident that, as you say, “Aggety dag” is Bosh for “I want to be where my mother is,” and so the faithful carpet understood it.’ ‘But how,’ said Anthea, catching up the Lamb and hugging him, ‘how did he get back here?’ ‘Oh,’ said the Phoenix, ‘I flew to the Psammead and wished that your infant brother were restored to your midst, and immediately it was so.’ ‘Oh, I am glad, I am glad!’ cried Anthea, still hugging the baby. ‘Oh, you darling! Shut up, Jane! I don’t care HOW much he comes off on me! Cyril! You and Robert roll that carpet up and put it in the beetle-cupboard. He might say “Aggety dag” again, and it might mean something quite different next time. Now, my Lamb, Panther’ll clean you a little. Come on.’ ‘I hope the beetles won’t go wishing,’ said Cyril, as they rolled up the carpet. Two days later mother was well enough to go out, and that evening the coconut matting came home. The children had talked and talked, and thought and thought, but they had not found any polite way of telling the Phoenix that they did not want it to stay any longer. The days had been days spent by the children in embarrassment, and by the Phoenix in sleep. And, now the matting was laid down, the Phoenix awoke and fluttered down on to it. It shook its crested head. ‘I like not this carpet,’ it said; ‘it is harsh and unyielding, and it hurts my golden feet.’ ‘We’ve jolly well got to get used to its hurting OUR golden feet,’ said Cyril. ‘This, then,’ said the bird, ‘supersedes the Wishing Carpet.’ ‘Yes,’ said Robert, ‘if you mean that it’s instead of it.’ ‘And the magic web?’ inquired the Phoenix, with sudden eagerness. ‘It’s the rag-and-bottle man’s day to-morrow,’ said Anthea, in a low voice; ‘he will take it away.’ The Phoenix fluttered up to its favourite perch on the chair-back. ‘Hear me!’ it cried, ‘oh youthful children of men, and restrain your tears of misery and despair, for what must be must be, and I would not remember you, thousands of years hence, as base ingrates and crawling worms compact of low selfishness.’ ‘I should hope not, indeed,’ said Cyril. ‘Weep not,’ the bird went on; ‘I really do beg that you won’t weep. I will not seek to break the news to you gently. Let the blow fall at once. The time has come when I must leave you.’ All four children breathed forth a long sigh of relief. ‘We needn’t have bothered so about how to break the news to it,’ whispered Cyril. ‘Ah, sigh not so,’ said the bird, gently. ‘All meetings end in partings. I must leave you. I have sought to prepare you for this. Ah, do not give way!’ ‘Must you really go, so soon?’ murmured Anthea. It was what she had often heard her mother say to calling ladies in the afternoon. ‘I must, really; thank you so much, dear,’ replied the bird, just as though it had been one of the ladies. ‘I am weary,’ it went on. ‘I desire to rest, after all the happenings of this last moon I do desire really to rest, and I ask of you one last boon.’ ‘Any little thing we can do,’ said Robert. Now that it had really come to parting with the Phoenix, whose favourite he had always been, Robert did feel almost as miserable as the Phoenix thought they all did. ‘I ask but the relic designed for the rag-and-bottle man. Give me what is left of the carpet and let me go.’ ‘Dare we?’ said Anthea. ‘Would mother mind?’ ‘I have dared greatly for your sakes,’ remarked the bird. ‘Well, then, we will,’ said Robert. The Phoenix fluffed out its feathers joyously. ‘Nor shall you regret it, children of golden hearts,’ it said. ‘Quick, spread the carpet and leave me alone; but first pile high the fire. Then, while I am immersed in the sacred preliminary rites, do ye prepare sweet-smelling woods and spices for the last act of parting.’ The children spread out what was left of the carpet. And, after all, though this was just what they would have wished to have happened, all hearts were sad. Then they put half a scuttle of coal on the fire and went out, closing the door on the Phoenix, left, at last, alone with the carpet. ‘One of us must keep watch,’ said Robert, excitedly, as soon as they were all out of the room, ‘and the others can go and buy sweet woods and spices. Get the very best that money can buy, and plenty of them. Don’t let’s stand to a threepence or so. I want it to have a jolly good send-off. It’s the only thing that’ll make us feel less horrid inside.’ It was felt that Robert, as the pet of the Phoenix, ought to have the last melancholy pleasure of choosing the materials for its funeral pyre. ‘I’ll keep watch if you like,’ said Cyril. ‘I don’t mind. And, besides, it’s raining hard, and my boots let in the wet. You might call and see if my other ones are “really reliable” again yet.’ So they left Cyril, standing like a Roman sentinel outside the door inside which the Phoenix was getting ready for the great change, and they all went out to buy the precious things for the last sad rites. ‘Robert is right,’ Anthea said; ‘this is no time for being careful about our money. Let’s go to the stationer’s first, and buy a whole packet of lead-pencils. They’re cheaper if you buy them by the packet.’ This was a thing that they had always wanted to do, but it needed the great excitement of a funeral pyre and a parting from a beloved Phoenix to screw them up to the extravagance. The people at the stationer’s said that the pencils were real cedar-wood, so I hope they were, for stationers should always speak the truth. At any rate they cost one-and-fourpence. Also they spent sevenpence three-farthings on a little sandal-wood box inlaid with ivory. ‘Because,’ said Anthea, ‘I know sandalwood smells sweet, and when it’s burned it smells very sweet indeed.’ ‘Ivory doesn’t smell at all,’ said Robert, ‘but I expect when you burn it it smells most awful vile, like bones.’ At the grocer’s they bought all the spices they could remember the names of, shell-like mace, cloves like blunt nails, peppercorns, the long and the round kind; ginger, the dry sort, of course; and the beautiful bloom-covered shells of fragrant cinnamon. Allspice too, and caraway seeds (caraway seeds that smelt most deadly when the time came for burning them). Camphor and oil of lavender were bought at the chemist’s, and also a little scent sachet labelled ‘Violettes de Parme’. They took the things home and found Cyril still on guard. When they had knocked and the golden voice of the Phoenix had said ‘Come in,’ they went in. There lay the carpet, or what was left of it, and on it lay an egg, exactly like the one out of which the Phoenix had been hatched. The Phoenix was walking round and round the egg, clucking with joy and pride. ‘I’ve laid it, you see,’ it said, ‘and as fine an egg as ever I laid in all my born days.’ Every one said yes, it was indeed a beauty. The things which the children had bought were now taken out of their papers and arranged on the table, and when the Phoenix had been persuaded to leave its egg for a moment and look at the materials for its last fire it was quite overcome. ‘Never, never have I had a finer pyre than this will be. You shall not regret it,’ it said, wiping away a golden tear. ‘Write quickly: “Go and tell the Psammead to fulfil the last wish of the Phoenix, and return instantly”.’ But Robert wished to be polite and he wrote,  ‘Please go and ask the Psammead to be so kind as to fulfil the Phoenix’s last wish, and come straight back, if you please.’ The paper was pinned to the carpet, which vanished and returned in the flash of an eye. Then another paper was written ordering the carpet to take the egg somewhere where it wouldn’t be hatched for another two thousand years. The Phoenix tore itself away from its cherished egg, which it watched with yearning tenderness till, the paper being pinned on, the carpet hastily rolled itself up round the egg, and both vanished for ever from the nursery of the house in Camden Town. ‘Oh, dear! oh, dear! oh, dear!’ said everybody. ‘Bear up,’ said the bird; ‘do you think  I  don’t suffer, being parted from my precious new-laid egg like this? Come, conquer your emotions and build my fire.’ ‘OH!’ cried Robert, suddenly, and wholly breaking down, ‘I can’t BEAR you to go!’ The Phoenix perched on his shoulder and rubbed its beak softly against his ear. ‘The sorrows of youth soon appear but as dreams,’ it said. ‘Farewell, Robert of my heart. I have loved you well.’ The fire had burnt to a red glow. One by one the spices and sweet woods were laid on it. Some smelt nice and some, the caraway seeds and the Violettes de Parme sachet among them, smelt worse than you would think possible. ‘Farewell, farewell, farewell, farewell!’ said the Phoenix, in a far-away voice. ‘Oh, GOOD-BYE,’ said every one, and now all were in tears. The bright bird fluttered seven times round the room and settled in the hot heart of the fire. The sweet gums and spices and woods flared and flickered around it, but its golden feathers did not burn. It seemed to grow red-hot to the very inside heart of it, and then before the eight eyes of its friends it fell together, a heap of white ashes, and the flames of the cedar pencils and the sandal-wood box met and joined above it. ‘Whatever have you done with the carpet?’ asked mother next day. ‘We gave it to some one who wanted it very much. The name began with a P,’ said Jane. The others instantly hushed her. ‘Oh, well, it wasn’t worth twopence,’ said mother. ‘The person who began with P said we shouldn’t lose by it,’ Jane went on before she could be stopped. ‘I daresay!’ said mother, laughing. But that very night a great box came, addressed to the children by all their names. Eliza never could remember the name of the carrier who brought it. It wasn’t Carter Paterson or the Parcels Delivery. It was instantly opened. It was a big wooden box, and it had to be opened with a hammer and the kitchen poker; the long nails came squeaking out, and boards scrunched as they were wrenched off. Inside the box was soft paper, with beautiful Chinese patterns on it, blue and green and red and violet. And under the paper, well, almost everything lovely that you can think of. Everything of reasonable size, I mean; for, of course, there were no motors or flying machines or thoroughbred chargers. But there really was almost everything else. Everything that the children had always wanted, toys and games and books, and chocolate and candied cherries and paint-boxes and photographic cameras, and all the presents they had always wanted to give to father and mother and the Lamb, only they had never had the money for them. At the very bottom of the box was a tiny golden feather. No one saw it but Robert, and he picked it up and hid it in the breast of his jacket, which had been so often the nesting-place of the golden bird. When he went to bed the feather was gone. It was the last he ever saw of the Phoenix. Pinned to the lovely fur cloak that mother had always wanted was a paper, and it said,  ‘In return for the carpet. With gratitude., P.’ You may guess how father and mother talked it over. They decided at last the person who had had the carpet, and whom, curiously enough, the children were quite unable to describe, must be an insane millionaire who amused himself by playing at being a rag-and-bone man. But the children knew better. They knew that this was the fulfilment, by the powerful Psammead, of the last wish of the Phoenix, and that this glorious and delightful boxful of treasures was really the very, very, very end of the Phoenix and the Carpet. CHAPTER I A Great Change 'There's no doubt about it, we really must economize somehow!' sighed Mrs. Woodward helplessly, with her housekeeping book in one hand, and her bank pass-book in the other, and an array of bills spread out on the table in front of her. 'Children, do you hear what I say? The war will make a great difference to our income, and we can't, simply  can't , go on living in exactly the old way. The sooner we all realize it the better. I wish I knew where to begin.' 'Might knock off going to church, and save the money we give in collections!' suggested Percy flippantly. 'It must tot up to quite a decent sum in the course of a year, not to mention pew rent!' His mother cast a reproachful glance at him. 'Now, Percy,  do  be serious for once! You and Winona are quite old enough to understand business matters. I must discuss them with somebody. As I said before, we shall really have to economize somehow, and the question is where to begin.' 'I saw some hints in a magazine the other day,' volunteered Winona, hunting among a pile of papers, and fishing up a copy of  The Housewife's Journal . 'Here you are! There's a whole article on War Economies. It says you can halve your expenses if you only try. It gives ten different recipes. Number One, Dispense with Servants. Oh, goody! I don't know how the house would get along without Maggie and Mary! Isn't that rather stiff?' 'It's impossible to be thought of for a moment! I should never dream of dismissing maids who have lived with me for years. I've read that article, and it may be practicable for other people, but certainly not for us. Oh, dear! Some of my friends recommend me to remove to the town, and others say 'Stay where you are, and keep poultry!'' 'We can't leave Highfield! We were all born here!' objected Winona decisively. 'And we tried keeping hens some time ago,' said Percy. 'They laid on an average three-quarters of an egg a year each, as far as I remember.' 'I'm afraid we didn't know how to manage them,' replied Mrs. Woodward fretfully. 'Percy, leave those papers alone! I didn't tell you to turn them over. You're mixing them all up, tiresome boy! Don't touch them again! It's no use trying to discuss business with you children! I shall write and consult Aunt Harriet. Go away, both of you, now! I want to have a quiet half-hour.' Aunt Harriet stood to the Woodward family somewhat in the light of a Delphic oracle. To apply to her was always the very last resource. Matters must have reached a crisis, Winona thought, if they were obliged to appeal to Aunt Harriet's judgment. She followed Percy into the garden with a sober look on her face. 'You don't think mother would really leave Highfield?' she asked her brother anxiously. 'Bunkum!' replied that light-hearted youth. 'We always have more or less of a fuss when my school bills come in. It'll soon fizzle out again! Don't you fret yourself. Things will jog on as they always have jogged on. There'll be nothing done, you'll see. Come on and bowl for me, that's a chubby one!' 'But this time mother really seemed to be in earnest,' said Winona meditatively, as she helped to put up the stumps. Mrs. Woodward had been left a widow three years before this story opens. She was a fair, fragile little woman, still pretty, and pathetically helpless. She had been accustomed to lean upon her husband, and now, for lack of firmer support, she leaned upon Winona. Winona was young to act as prop, and though it flattered her sense of importance, it had put a row of wrinkles on her girlish forehead. At fifteen she seemed much older than Percy at sixteen. No one ever dreamt of taking Percy seriously; he was one of those jolly, easy-going, happy-go-lucky, unreliable people who saunter through life with no other aim than to amuse themselves at all costs. To depend upon him was like trusting to a boat without a bottom. Though nominally the eldest, he had little more sense of responsibility than Ernie, the youngest. It was Winona who shouldered the family burdens. The Woodwards had always lived at Highfield, and in their opinion it was the most desirable residence in the whole of Rytonshire. The house was old enough to be picturesque, but modern enough for comfort. Its quaint gables, mullioned windows and Cromwellian porch were the joy of photographers, while the old-fashioned hall, when the big log fire was lighted, would be hard to beat for coziness. The schoolroom, on the ground floor, had a separate side entrance on to the lawn, leading through a small ante-room where boots and coats and cricket bats and tennis rackets could be kept; the drawing-room had a luxurious ingle nook with cushioned seats, and all the bedrooms but two had a southern aspect. As for the big rambling garden, it was full of delightful old-world flowers that came up year after year: daffodils and violets and snow-flakes, and clumps of pinks, and orange lilies and Canterbury bells, and tall Michaelmas daisies, and ribbon grass and royal Osmunda fern, the sort of flowers that people used to pick in days gone by, put a paper frill round, and call a nosegay or a posy. There was a lawn for tennis and cricket, a pond planted with irises and bulrushes, and a wild corner where crocuses and coltsfoot and golden aconite came up as they liked in the spring time. Winona loved this garden with somewhat the same attachment that a French peasant bears for the soil upon which he has been reared. She rejoiced in every yard of it. To go away and resign it to others would be tragedy unspeakable. The fear that Aunt Harriet might recommend the family to leave Highfield was sufficient to darken her horizon indefinitely. That her mother had written to consult the oracle she was well aware, for she had been sent to post the letter. She had an instinctive apprehension that the answer would prove a turning-point in her career. For a day or two everything went on as usual. Mrs. Woodward did not again allude to her difficulties, Percy had conveniently forgotten them, and the younger children were not aware of their existence. Winona lived with a black spot dancing before her mental eyes. It was continually rising up and blotting out the sunshine. On the fourth morning appeared a letter addressed in an old-fashioned slanting handwriting, and bearing the Seaton post mark. Mrs. Woodward read it in silence, and left her toast unfinished. Aunt Harriet's communications generally upset her for the day. 'Come here, Winona,' she said agitatedly, after breakfast. 'Oh, dear, I wish I knew what to do! It's so very unexpected, but of course it would be a splendid thing for you. If only I could consult somebody! I suppose girls nowadays will have to learn to support themselves, and the war will alter everything, but I'd always meant you to stop at home and look after the little ones for me, and it's very, ' 'What does Aunt Harriet say, mother?' interrupted Winona, with a catch in her throat. 'She says a great deal, and I dare say she's right. Oh, this terrible war! Things were so different when I was a girl! You might as well read the letter for yourself, as it concerns you. I always think she's hard on Percy, poor lad! I was afraid the children were too noisy the last time she was here, but they wouldn't keep quiet. I'm sure I try to do my best all round, and you know, Winona, how I said Aunt Harriet, ' But Winona was already devouring the letter.                                         '10 Abbey Close,                                                   'Seaton,                                                     'August 26th.         'MY DEAR FLORITA,, You are quite right to consult me         in your difficulties, and are welcome to any advice which I am         able to offer you. I am sorry to hear of your financial         embarrassments, but I am not surprised. The present increase in         the cost of living, and extra taxation, will make retrenchments         necessary to everybody. In the circumstances I should not advise         you to leave Highfield. ('Oh, thank goodness!' ejaculated         Winona.) The expense of a removal would probably cancel what you         would otherwise save. Neither should I recommend you to take         Percy from Longworth College and send him daily to be coached by         your parish curate. From my knowledge of his character I         consider the discipline of a public school to be indispensable         if he is to grow into worthy manhood, and sooner than allow the         wholesome restraint of his house master to be removed at this         critical portion of his life, I will myself defray half the cost         of his maintenance for the next two years.         'Now as regards Winona. I believe she has ability, and it is         high time to begin to think seriously what you mean to do with         her. In the future women will have to depend upon themselves,         and I consider that all girls should be trained to gain their         own living. The foundation of every career is a good         education, without this it is impossible to build at all, and         Winona certainly cannot obtain it if she remains at home. The         new High School at Seaton is offering two open Scholarships to         girls resident in the County, the examination for which is on         September 8th. I propose that Winona enters for this         examination, and that if she should be a successful candidate,         she should come to live with me during the period of her         attendance at the High School. The education is the best         possible, there is a prospect of a University Scholarship to be         competed for, and every help and encouragement is given to the         girls in their choice of a career. With Winona off your hands, I         should suggest that you should engage a competent nursery         governess to teach the younger children the elements of order         and discipline. I would gladly pay her salary on the         understanding that I should myself select her.         'Trusting that these proposals may be of some service, and         hoping to hear a better account of your health,                                                 'I remain,                                         'Your affectionate Aunt                                                   'and Godmother,                                                         'Harriet Beach.' Winona laid down the letter with an agitated gasp. The proposition almost took her breath away. 'What an idea!' she exclaimed indignantly. 'Mother, of course you won't even dream of it for an instant! I'd  hate  to go and live with Aunt Harriet. It's not to be thought of!' 'Well, I don't know, Winona!' wavered Mrs. Woodward. 'We must look at it from all sides, and perhaps Aunt Harriet's right, and it really would be for the best. Miss Harmon's a poor teacher, and I'm sure your music, at any rate, is not a credit to her. You played that last piece shockingly out of time. You know you said yourself that you were getting beyond Miss Harmon!' Whatever impeachments Winona may have brought against her teacher, she was certainly not prepared to admit them now. She rejected the project of the Seaton High School with the utmost energy and determination, bringing into the fray all that force of character which her mother lacked. Poor Mrs. Woodward vacillated feebly, she was generally swayed by whoever was nearest at the moment, and I verily believe Winona's arguments would have prevailed, and the whole scheme would have been abandoned, had not Mr. Joynson opportunely happened to turn up. Mr. Joynson was a solicitor, and the trustee of Mrs. Woodward's property. He managed most of her business affairs, and some of her private ones as well. She had confidence in his judgment, and she at once thankfully submitted the question of Winona's future to his decision. 'The very thing for her!' he declared. 'Do her a world of good to go to a proper school. She's frittering her time away here. Send her to Seaton by all means. What are you to do without her? Nonsense! Nobody's indispensable, especially a girl of fifteen! Pack her off as soon as you can. Doesn't want to go? Oh, she'll sing a different song when once she gets there, you'll see!' Thus supported by masculine authority, Mrs. Woodward settled the question in the affirmative, and replied to her aunt by return of post. Naturally such a stupendous event as the exodus of Winona made a sensation in the household. 'Well, of all the rum shows!' exclaimed Percy. 'You and Aunt Harriet in double harness! It beats me altogether!' 'It's atrocious!' groaned Winona. 'I'm a victim sacrificed for the good of the family. Oh! why couldn't mother have thought of some other way of economizing? I don't want to win scholarships and go in for a career!' 'Buck up! Perhaps you won't win! There'll be others in for the exam., you bet! You'll probably fail, and come whining home like a whipped puppy with its tail between its legs!' 'Indeed I shan't!' flared Winona indignantly. 'I've a little more spirit than that, thank you! And why should you imagine I'm going to fail? I suppose I've as much brains as most people!' 'That's right! Upset the pepper-pot! I was only trying to comfort you!' teased Percy. 'In my opinion you'll be returned like a bad halfpenny, or one of those articles 'of no use to anybody except the owner.' Aunt Harriet will be cheated of her prey after all!' 'If Win goes away, I shall be the eldest daughter at home,' said Letty airily, shaking out her short skirts. 'I'll sit at the end of the table, and pour out tea if mother has a headache, and unlock the apple room, and use the best inkpot if I like, and have first innings at the piano.' 'You forget about the nursery governess,' retorted Winona. 'If I go, she comes, and you'll find you've exchanged King Log for King Stork. Oh, very well, just wait and see! It won't be as idyllic as you imagine. I shall be saved the trouble of looking after you, at any rate.' 'What I'm trying to ascertain, madam,' said Percy blandly, 'is whether your ladyship wishes to take up your residence in Seaton or not. With the usual perversity of your sex you pursue a pig policy. When I venture to picture you seated at the board of your venerable aunt, you protest you are a sacrifice; when, on the other hand, I suggest your return to the bosom of your family, you revile me equally.' 'You're the most unsympathetic  beast  I've ever met!' declared Winona aggrievedly. When she analyzed her feelings, however, she was obliged to allow that they were mixed. Though the prospect of settling down at Seaton filled her with dismay, Percy's gibe at her probable failure touched her pride. Winona had always been counted as the clever member of the family. It would be too ignominious to be sent home labeled unfit. She set her teeth and clenched her fists at the bare notion. 'I'll show them all what I can do if I take a thing up!' she resolved. In the meantime Mrs. Woodward was immersed in the subject of clothing. Every post brought her boxes of patterns, amongst which she hesitated, lost in choice. 'If I knew whether you're really going to stay at Seaton or not, it would make all the difference, Winona,' she fluttered. 'It's no use buying you these new things if you're only to wear them at home, but I'd make an effort to send you nice to Aunt Harriet's. I know she'll criticize everything you have on. Dear me, I think I'd better risk it! It would be such a nuisance to have to write for the patterns all over again, and how could I get your dresses fitted when you weren't here to be tried on? Miss Jones is at liberty now, and can come for a week's sewing, but she'll probably be busy if I want her later. Now tell me, which do you really think is the prettier of these two shades? I like the fawn, but I believe the material will spot. What have you done with the lace collar Aunt Harriet gave you last Christmas? She's sure to ask about it if you don't wear it!' Having decided that on the whole she intended to win a scholarship, Winona bluffed off the matter of her departure. 'I've changed my mind, that's all,' she announced to her home circle. 'It will be a great comfort to me not to hear Mamie scraping away at her violin in the evenings, or Letty strumming at scales. Think what a relief not to be obliged to rout up Dorrie and Godfrey, and haul them off to school every day! I'm tired of setting an example. You needn't snigger!' The family grinned appreciatively. They understood Winona. 'Don't you worry! I'll set the example when you're gone,' Letty assured her. 'I'll be as improving as a copy-book. I wish I'd your chance; I'd stand Aunt Harriet for the sake of going to a big High School. Younger sisters never have any luck! Eldests just sweep the board. I don't know where we come in!' 'Don't you fret, young 'un, you'll score later on!' cooed an indulgent voice from the sofa, where Percy sprawled with a book and a bag of walnuts. 'Remember that when you're still in all the bliss and sparkle of your teens, Winona'll be a mature and  passée  person of twenty-two. 'That eldest Miss Woodward's getting on, you know!' people will say, and somebody'll reply: 'Yes, poor thing!'' 'They won't when I've got a career,' retorted Winona, pelting Percy with his own walnut-shells. 'You assured us the other day that you despised such vanities.' 'Well, it depends. Perhaps I'll be a lady tram conductor, and punch tickets, or a post-woman, or drive a Government van!' 'If those are careers for girls, bag me for a steeple jack,' chirped Dorrie. It was perhaps a good thing for Winona that such a short interval elapsed between the acceptance of Aunt Harriet's proposal and the date of the scholarship examination. The ten days were very busy ones, for there seemed much to be done in the way of preparation. Miss Jones, the dressmaker, was installed in the nursery with the sewing-machine, and demanded frequent tryings-on, a process Winona hated. 'I shall buy all my clothes ready made when I'm grown up!' she declared. 'They very seldom fit, and have to be altered,' returned her mother. 'Do stand still, Winona! And I hope you're learning up a few dates and facts for this examination. You ought to be studying every morning. If only Miss Harmon were home, I'd have asked her to coach you. I'm afraid she'll be disappointed at your leaving, but of course she can't expect to keep you for ever. I heard a rumor that she means to give up her school altogether, and go and live with her uncle. I hope it's true, and then I can take the little ones away with an easy conscience. I don't want to treat her badly, poor thing, but I'm sure teaching's not her vocation.' Winona really made a heroic effort to prepare herself for the coming ordeal. She retired to a secluded part of the garden and read over her latest school books. The process landed her in the depths of despondency. 'I'll never remember anything, never!' she mourned to her family. 'To try and get all this into my head at once is like bolting a week's meals at a single go! I know a date here and there, and I've a hazy notion of French and Latin verbs, and a general impression of other subjects, but if they ask me for anything definite, such as the battles of the Wars of the Roses, or a list of the products of India, I'm done for!' 'Go in for Post-Impressionism, then,' suggested Percy. 'Write from a romantic standpoint, and don't condescend to mere facts. Stick in a quotation or two, and a drawing if possible, and make your paper sound eloquent and dramatic and poetical, and all the rest of it. They'll mark you low for accuracy, but put you on ten per cent. for style, you bet! I know a chap who tries it on at the Coll., and it always pays.' 'It's worth thinking about, certainly,' said Winona, shutting her books with a weary yawn. CHAPTER II An Entrance Examination The Seaton High School was a large, handsome brick building exactly opposite the public park. It had only been erected two years ago, so everything about it was absolutely new and up-to-date. It supplied a great need in the rapidly growing city, and indeed offered the best and most go-ahead education to be obtained in the district. It was the aim of the school to fit girls for various professions and careers; there was a classical and a modern side, a department for domestic economy, and a commercial class for instruction in business details. Art, music, and nature study were well catered for, and manual training was not forgotten. As the school was intended to become in time a center for the county, the Governors had offered two open free scholarships to be competed for by girls resident in other parts of Rytonshire, hoping by this means to attract pupils from the country places round about. On the morning of September 8th, precisely at 8.35, Winona presented herself at the school for the scholarship examination. There were twenty other candidates awaiting the ordeal, in various stages of nervousness or sangfroid. Some looked dejected, some confident, and others hid their feelings under a mask of stolidity. Winona joined them shyly. They were all unknown to one another, and so far nobody had plucked up courage to venture a remark. It is horribly depressing to sit on a form staring at twenty taciturn strangers. Winona bore for awhile with the stony silence, then, rather frightened at the sound of her own voice, she announced: 'I suppose we're all going in for this same exam.!' It was a trite commonplace, but it broke the ice. Everybody looked relieved. The atmosphere seemed to clear. 'Yes, we're all going in, that's right enough,' replied a ruddy-haired girl in spectacles, 'but there are only two scholarships, so nineteen of us are bound to fail, that's logic and mathematics and all the rest of it.' 'Whew! A nice cheering prospect. Wish they'd put us out of our misery at once!' groaned a stout girl with a long fair pigtail. 'I'm all upset!' shivered another. 'It's like a game of musical chairs,' suggested a fourth. 'We're all scrambling for the same thing, and some are bound to be out of it.' The ruddy-haired girl laughed nervously. 'Suppose we've got to take our sporting luck!' she murmured. 'If nineteen are sure to lose, two are sure to win at any rate,' said Winona. 'That's logic and mathematics and all the rest of it, too!' 'Right you are! That's a more cheering creed! It doesn't do to cry 'Miserere me' too soon!' chirped a jolly-looking dark-eyed girl with a red hair-ribbon. ''Never say die till you're dead,' is my motto!' 'I'm wearing a swastika for a mascot,' said a short, pale girl, exhibiting her charm, which hung from a chain round her neck. 'I never am lucky, so I thought I'd try what this would do for me for once. I know English history beautifully down to the end of Queen Anne, and no further, and if they set any questions on the Georges I'll be stumped.' 'I've learnt Africa, but Asia would floor me!' observed another, looking up from a geography book, in which she was making a last desperate clutch at likely items of knowledge. 'I never can remember which side of India Madras is on; I get it hopelessly mixed with Bombay.' 'I wish to goodness they'd go ahead and begin,' mourned the owner of the red hair-ribbon. 'It's this waiting that knocks the spirit out of me. Patience isn't my pet virtue. I call it cruelty to animals to leave us on tenter-hooks.' Almost as if in answer to her pathetic appeal the door opened, and a teacher appeared. In a brisk, business-like manner she marshaled the candidates into line, and conducted them to the door of the head-mistress' study, where one by one they were admitted for a brief private interview. Winona's turn came about the middle of the row. 'Pass in: as quickly as you can, please!' commanded the teacher, motioning her onward. As Winona entered, she gave one hasty comprehensive glance round the room, taking in a general impression of books, busts and pictures, then focussed her attention on the figure that sat at the desk. It was only at a later date that she grasped any details of Miss Bishop's personality; at that first meeting she realized nothing but the pair of compelling blue eyes that drew her forward like a magnet. 'Your name?' 'Winona Woodward.' 'Age?' 'Fifteen.' 'Residence?' 'Highfield, Ashbourne, near Great Marston.' 'How long have you lived in the county of Rytonshire?' 'Ever since I was born.' Miss Bishop hastily ticked off these replies on a page of her ledger, and handed Winona a card. 'This will admit you to the examination room. Remember that instead of putting your name at the head of your papers, you are to write the number given you on your card. Any candidate writing her own name will be disqualified. Next girl!' It was all over in two minutes. Winona seemed hardly to have entered the room before she was out again. 'Move on, please!' said the teacher, marshaling the little crowd round the door. 'Will those who have seen Miss Bishop kindly go along the corridor.' Several girls who had been standing in a knot made a sudden bolt, and pushed their fellows forward. Somebody jogged Winona's elbow. Her card slid from her grasp and fell on to the ground. As she bent in the crush to pick it up, the ruddy-haired girl stooped on a like errand. 'Dropped mine too! Clumsy, isn't it?' she laughed. 'Hope we've got our own! What was your number?' 'I hadn't time to look.' 'Well, I'm sure mine was eleven, so that's all right. I wish you luck! Won't we just be glad when it's over, rather!' At the further end of the corridor was a door with a notice pinned on to it. 'Examination for County Scholarships.' A mistress stood there, and scrutinized each girl's card as she entered, directing her to a seat in the room marked with the corresponding number. Winona walked rather solemnly to the desk labeled 10. The great ordeal was at last about to begin. She wondered what would be the end of it. Little thrills of nervousness seemed running down her back like drops from a shower-bath. Her hands were trembling. With a great effort she pulled herself together. 'It's no use funking!' she thought. 'I'll make as good a shot as I can at things, and if I fail, well, I shall have plenty of companions in misfortune, at any rate!' A pile of foolscap paper with red-ruled margins, a clean sheet of white blotting paper, and a penholder with a new nib lay ready. Each of the other twenty victims was surveying a supply of similar material. On the blackboard was chalked the word 'Silence.' In a dead hush the candidates sat and waited. Exactly on the stroke of nine Miss Bishop entered and handed a sheaf of printed questions to the teacher in charge, who distributed them round the room. The subject for the first hour was arithmetic. Winona read over her paper slowly. She felt capable of managing it, all except the last two problem sums, which were outside her experience. She knew it would mainly be a question of accuracy. 'I'll work them each twice if I've only time,' she thought, starting at number one. An hour is after all only made up of sixty minutes, and these seemed to fly with incredible rapidity. The teacher on the platform had sternly reproved a girl guilty of counting aloud in an agitated whisper, threatening instant expulsion for a repetition of such an offense, but with this solitary exception nobody transgressed the rules. All sat quietly absorbed in their work, and an occasional rustle of paper or scratch of a pen were the only sounds audible. At precisely five minutes to ten the deity on the platform sounded a bell, and ordered papers to be put together. She collected them, handed them to another mistress, then without any break proceeded to deal out the questions for the next hour's examination. This was in geography, and here Winona was not on such sure ground. Granted that you are acquainted with certain rules in arithmetic, it is always possible to work out problems, but it needed more knowledge than she possessed to write answers to the riddles that confronted her. She had never heard of 'The Iron Gates,' could not place Alcona and Altona, was hazy as to the whereabouts of the Mourne Mountains, and utterly unable to draw an accurate map of the Balkan States. She scored a little on Canada, for she had learnt North America last term at Miss Harmon's, but with Australia and New Zealand she was imperfectly acquainted. She wrote away, getting hotter and hotter as she realized her deficiencies, winding up five minutes before the time allotted, in a flushed and decidedly inky condition. At eleven a short interval was allowed, and the candidates thankfully adjourned. Outside in the corridor they compared notes. 'Well, of all detestable papers this geography one is the limit!' declared an aggrieved voice. It was the girl who had said that she always mixed Madras and Bombay, and who had studied her text-book up to the last available moment. Apparently her eleventh hour industry had not sufficed to tide her over her difficulties. 'It was catchy in parts,' agreed the owner of the swastika, 'but I liked one or two questions. I just happened to know them, so I bowled ahead. That's what comes of wearing a mascot!' 'Don't crow too soon!' laughed the girl with the fair pigtail. 'Remember, there are four other exams. to follow. Your luck may leave you at any moment.' 'Don't mention more exams.! I feel inclined to turn tail and run home!' declared another. 'There's the bell! Don't give us much time, do they? Now for the torture chamber again! Brace your nerves!' 'I wonder if most of them have done better or worse than I have!' thought Winona, as she took her seat once more at No. 10 desk. 'A good many were grumbling, but that sandy-haired girl in the spectacles said nothing. No more did the one with the red hair-ribbon. Of course they might be feeling too agonized for words, but on the other hand they might be secretly congratulating themselves.' It was not the moment, however, for speculation as to her neighbors' progress. The next set of questions was being distributed, and she took up her copy eagerly. Her heart fell as she read it over. Her knowledge of English history was not very accurate, and the facts demanded were for the most part exactly those which she could not remember. The dread of failure loomed up large. She could only attempt about half of the questions, and even in these she was not ready with dates. Then suddenly Percy's advice flashed into her mind. 'Write from a romantic standpoint, and make your paper sound poetical.' It seemed rather a forlorn hope, and she feared it would scarcely satisfy her examiners, but in such a desperate situation anything was worth trying. Winona possessed a certain facility in essay writing. Prose composition had been her favorite lesson at Miss Harmon's. She collected her wits now, and did the very utmost of which she was capable in the matter of style. Choosing question No. 4, 'Write a life of Lady Jane Grey,' she proceeded to treat the subject in as post-impressionist a manner as possible. The pathetic tragedy of the young Queen had always appealed to her imagination, and she could have had no more congenial a theme upon which to write, if she had been given free choice of all the characters in the history book. ''Whom the gods love die young,'' she began, and paused. It seemed an excellent opening, if she could only continue in the same strain, but what ought to come next? Her thoughts flew to a painting of Lady Jane Grey, which she had once seen at a loan collection of Tudor portraits. Why should she not describe it? Her pen flew rapidly as she wrote a word-picture of the sweet, pale face, so round and childish in spite of its earnest expression; the smooth yellow hair, the gray eyes bent demurely over the book. Her heroine seemed beginning to live. Now for her surroundings. A year ago Winona had paid a visit to Hampton Court, and her remembrance of its associations was still keen and vivid. She described its old-world garden by the side of the Thames, where the little King Edward VI. must often have roamed with his pretty cousin Jane: the two wonderful ill-starred children, playing for a brief hour in happy unconsciousness of the fate that faced them. What did they talk about, she asked, as they stood on the paved terrace and watched the river hurrying by? Plato, perchance, and his philosophy, or the marvelous geography-book with woodcuts of foreign beasts that had been specially printed for the young king's use. Did they compare notes about their tutors? Jane would certainly hold a brief for her much-loved Mr. Elmer, who, in sharp contrast to her parents' severity, taught her so gently and patiently that she grudged the time which was not spent in his presence. Edward might bemoan the ill-luck of his whipping-boy, who had to bear the floggings which Court etiquette denied to the royal shoulders, and perhaps would declare that when he was grown up, and could make the laws himself, no children should be beaten for badly said lessons, and Jane would agree with him, and then they would pick the red damask roses that Cardinal Wolsey had planted, and walk back under the shadow of the clipped yew hedge to eat cherries and junket in the room that looked out towards the sunset. Winona had warmed to her work. Her imagination, always her strongest faculty, completely carried her away. She pictured her heroine's life, not from the outside, as historians would chronicle it, a mere string of events and dates, but from the inner view of a girl's standpoint. Did Jane wish to leave her Plato for the bustle of a Court? Did she care for the gay young husband forced upon her by her ambitious parents? Surely for her gentle nature a crown held few allurements. The clouds were gathering thick and fast, and burst in a waterspout of utter ruin. Jane's courage was calm and hopeful as that of Socrates in the dialogues she had loved.         '... your soul was pure and true,     The good stars met in your horoscope,     Made you of spirit, fire and dew.' quoted Winona enthusiastically. Browning always stirred her blood, and threw her into poetical channels. She cast about in her mind for any other appropriate verses.     'Ah, broken is the golden bowl, the spirit gone for ever,     Let the bell toll, a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river.     Come, let the burial rite be read, the funeral song be sung,     An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young,     A dirge for her, the doubly dead, in that she died so young.' 'So they finished their foul deed, and laid her to rest,' wrote Winona, 'the earthly part, that is, which perishes, for the true part of her they could not touch. Farewell, sweet innocent soul, of whom the world was not worthy. To you surely may apply Andre de Chénier's tender lines:     ''Au banquet de la vie à peine commencé     Un instant seulement mes lèvres out pressé     La coupe en mes mains encore pleine.' Vale, little Queen! May it be well with thee! Ave atque vale!' Winona glanced anxiously at the clock as with a hard breath she paused for a moment and laid down her pen. Her theme had taken her so long that she had only ten minutes left for the other questions. There was no romantic side to be expressed in these, so she scribbled away half-heartedly. Her uncertain memory, which had readily supplied quotations from Browning or Edgar Allan Poe, struck altogether when asked for such sordid details as the names of the Cabal ministry, or the history of the Long Parliament. The bell rang, and left her with her paper only half finished. At one o'clock the candidates were given an hour's rest, and a hot lunch was served to them in the dining-hall. At two they returned to their desks, and the examination continued until half-past four. Winona found the questions tolerable. She did fairly, but not at all brilliantly. Her brains were not accustomed to such long-sustained efforts, and as the afternoon wore on, a neuralgic headache began, and sent sharp throbs of pain across her forehead. It was so irksome to write pages of Latin or French verbs; she had to summon all her courage to make herself do it. The last hour seemed an interminable penance. At half-past four, twenty-one rather dispirited candidates filed from the room. 'Well, thank goodness it's over! I never want to write another word in my life. My hand's stiff with cramp!' exclaimed the girl with the red hair-ribbon to a sympathetic audience in the passage. 'It was awful! I didn't answer half the questions. My swastika isn't worth its salt. I shall give it away!' mourned the owner of the mascot. 'They expected us to know so very much; we should be absolute encyclopaedias if we had all that pat off at our fingers' ends!' sighed the girl with the fair pigtail. 'How did you get on?' Winona asked the ruddy-haired girl, who was wiping her spectacles nervously. 'Oh, I don't know. It's so hard to tell. I answered most of the questions, but of course I can't say whether they're right or wrong. Wasn't the Latin translation just too horrible? I yearned for a dictionary. And some of the French grammar questions were absolute catches!' 'We went on too long,' said Winona. 'It would have been much better to spread the exam, over two days.' 'Do you think so? I'd rather have 'sudden death' myself. It's such a relief to feel it's finished. It would be wretched to have to begin again to-morrow. I hardly slept a wink last night for thinking about it. I'm going to try and forget it now.' Winona nodded good-by to her fellow candidates, and took her leave. How many of them would she see again, she wondered, and which among all the number would have the luck? 'Certainly not myself,' she thought ruefully. 'I know my papers weren't up to standard. I believe that red-haired girl will be one. She looked clever!' Winona had spent the preceding night with Aunt Harriet, who offered to keep her until the result of the examination should be published, but the prospect of spending a week of suspense at Abbey Close was so formidable, that she had begged to be allowed to return home, excusing herself on the plea that she would like to be with Percy during the remainder of his holidays. It was a very subdued Winona who reached Highfield next afternoon. 'Hello, Tiddleywinks! You've lost the starch out of you!' Percy greeted her. 'Did they say they wouldn't have you at any price?' 'The result won't be out till the fifteenth, but I expect I've failed,' answered Winona gloomily. 'Buck up, young 'un! Look at yours truly! I fail nine times out of ten, and do I take it to heart?' Winona laughed in spite of herself. Percy's complacency over small achievements was proverbial. But she had higher ambitions, and the cloud of depression soon settled down again. Her temper, not always her strong point, displayed a degree of irritability that drove her family to the verge of mutiny. 'Really, Winona, I don't remember you so fractious since you were cutting your teeth!' complained her much-tried mother. The days dragged slowly by. Winona had never before realized that each hour could hold so many minutes. On the morning of the 15th she came down to breakfast with dark rings round her eyes. 'I shall be glad to be put out of my misery!' she thought, as the postman's rap-tap sounded at the door. Mamie made a rush for the letter-box, and returned bearing a foolscap envelope addressed to:                                    MISS WINONA WOODWARD,                                              Highfield,                                                   Ashbourne,                                                     nr. Great Marston. Winona opened it with trembling fingers. But as she read, her face flushed and her eyes sparkled. 'I have much pleasure in informing you' (so ran the letter) 'that the Governors of the Seaton High School have decided to award you a Scholarship tenable for two years....' In silence she passed the paper to her mother. 'Congratulations, dear child!' cried Mrs. Woodward, clapping her hands. 'It's the unexpected that happens!' 'Oh, my goodness!' ejaculated Percy. 'You never mean to tell me that Tiddleywinks has actually been and gone and won!' CHAPTER III Seaton High School The autumn term at Seaton High School began on September 22nd. On the 21st Winona set forth with great flourish of trumpets, feeling more or less of a heroine. To have been selected for a scholarship among twenty-one candidates was a distinction that even Aunt Harriet would admit. In the brief interval pending her departure, her home circle had treated her with a respect they had never before accorded her. 'I hope you'll do well, child,' said her mother, half proud and half tearful when it came to the parting. 'We shall miss you here, but when you get on yourself you must help the younger ones. I shall look to you to push them on in life.' There is a certain satisfaction in the knowledge that you are considered the prop of the family. Winona's eyes glowed. In imagination she was already Principal of a large school, and providing posts as assistant mistresses for Letty, Mamie and Doris, that is to say unless she turned her attention to medicine, but in that case she could be head of a Women's Hospital, and have them as house surgeons or dispensers, or something else equally distinguished and profitable. It might even be possible to provide occupation for Godfrey or Ernie, though this was likely to prove a tougher job than placing the girls. With such a brilliant beginning, the future seemed an easy walk-over. Mrs. Woodward was exulting over the fact that she had engaged Miss Jones when she did, and that Winona's school clothes were all made and finished. There had been a fluster at the last, when it was discovered that her mackintosh was fully six inches too short for her new skirts, and that she had outgrown her thick boots, but a hurried visit to Great Marston had remedied these deficiencies, and the box was packed to everybody's satisfaction. There was a universal feeling in the family that such an outfit could not fail to meet with Aunt Harriet's approval. The first sight of the nightdress case and the brush-and-comb bag must wring admiration from her. They had been bought at a bazaar, and were altogether superior to those in daily use. As for the handkerchief case, Letty had decided that unless one equally well embroidered were presented to her on her next birthday, she would be obliged to assert her individuality by showing temper. Winona walked into the dressing-room of the High School on September 22nd with a mixture of shyness and importance. On the whole the latter predominated. It was a trifle embarrassing to face so many strangers, but it was something to have won a scholarship. She wondered who was the other fortunate candidate. 'I expect it will be that red-haired girl with the spectacles,' she thought. 'I believe she answered every question, though she was rather quiet about it.' She looked round, but could not see the ruddy locks, nor indeed any of the companions who had taken the examination with her. 'Hunting for some one you know?' asked a girl who had appropriated the next hook to hers. 'Yes, at least I'm not sure whether she'll be here or not. I believe her name's Marjorie Kaye.' 'Never heard of her!' 'There are heaps of new girls,' volunteered another who stood by. 'I wondered if she'd won a County Scholarship,' added Winona. 'Ask me a harder! I tell you I've never heard her name before.' 'I've won the other scholarship.' Winona's voice was intended to sound very casual. 'Indeed!' Her neighbor was taking off her boots, and did not seem as much impressed as the occasion merited. 'Oh! so you're one of the 'outlanders,'' sniggered another. 'It's a sort of 'go into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in' business.' 'I suppose we shall be having Council School Scholarships next!' drawled a third. They were friends, and went off together without another glance at Winona. She followed soberly, wondering what she ought to do next. She had a vague idea that the winner of a scholarship should present herself at the Head Mistress' study to receive a few words of encouragement and congratulation on her success. At the top of the stairs she met the mistress who had presided over the examination. The latter greeted her unceremoniously. 'Winona Woodward, you've been placed in V.a., first room to the right, round the corner. You'll find the number on the door.' Other girls were hurrying in the same direction. Winona entered with what seemed to her quite a small crowd. Everybody appeared to know where to go, except herself. She stood in such evident hesitation that one, more good-natured than the rest, remarked: 'You'd better seize on any desk you fancy, as quick as you can. They're getting taken up fast, if you want a front one!' Winona slid into the nearest seat at hand, and appropriated it by placing her note-book, pencil-box, ruler, atlas and dictionaries inside the desk. The room was filling quickly. Every moment fresh arrivals hurried in and took their places. Marjorie Kaye was nowhere to be seen, but in the second row sat the dark-eyed girl with the red ribbon in her hair. She turned round and nodded pleasantly. 'So she's got the other scholarship!' thought Winona. 'I shouldn't have expected it. I'd have staked my reputation on the sandy-haired one. Well, I suppose her answers weren't correct, after all. I'm rather glad on the whole it's this girl; she looks jolly.' At that moment Miss Huntley, the form mistress, entered and took the call-over, and the day's work began. Each girl was given a time-table and a list of the books she would require, and after that, class succeeded class until one o'clock, with a ten minutes' interval for lunch at eleven. The conclusion of the morning left Winona with a profound respect for High School methods. After the easy-going routine of Miss Harmon's it was like stepping into a new educational world. She supposed she would be able to keep pace with it when she got her books, but the mathematics, at any rate, were much more advanced than what she had before attempted. As she walked down the corridor, the girl with the red hair-ribbon overtook her, and claimed acquaintance. 'So you're Winona Woodward? And I'm Garnet Emerson. We had the luck, after all! I'm sure I never expected to win. It was the greatest surprise to me when the letter arrived. Yes, five of the other candidates are at school, but they've been put in IV.a., and IV.b. Marjorie Kaye? You mean that girl in spectacles? No, she's not come. I heard her say that if she didn't win she was to be sent somewhere else. Where are you staying? With an aunt? I'm with a second cousin. She's nice, but I wish they'd open a hostel; it would be topping to be with a heap of others, wouldn't it? We'd get up acting in the evenings, and all sorts of fun. Well, perhaps that may come later on. I shall see you this afternoon, shan't I?' 'Yes, I'm coming for my books. It's too late to stop and get them now.' Afternoon attendance at the High School was not nominally compulsory. All the principal subjects were taken in the morning, but there were classes for drawing, singing or physical culture from half-past two until four, and practically very few girls had more than one free afternoon in a week. Any who liked might do preparation in their own form room, and many availed themselves of the permission, especially those who came from a distance, and stayed for dinner at the school. When Winona first examined her time-table she had not considered its demands excessively formidable, but before she had been a week at Seaton she began to realize that she would have very few spare moments to call her own. Miss Bishop believed in girls being fully occupied, and in addition to the ordinary form work, expected every one to take part in the games, and in the numerous societies and guilds which had been instituted. Winona found that she was required to join the Debating Club, and the Patriotic Knitting Guild, while a Dramatic Society and a Literary Association would be prepared to open their doors to her if she proved worthy of admission. So far, however, she considered that she had enough on her hands. The demands of her new life were almost overwhelming, and she lived from day to day in a whirl of fresh experiences. It took her some time even to grasp the names of the seventeen other girls in her form. Audrey Redfern, her left-hand neighbor, was friendly, but Olave Parry, at the desk in front, ignored her very existence. She gathered that Audrey, like herself, was a new-comer, while Olave had attended the school since its foundation; but she did not realize the significance of this in the difference of their behavior to her. The fact was that the three new girls in the form were on probation. The others, who had come up from the Lower School, and were well versed in the traditions of the place, were not willing to admit them too quickly into favor. They talked them over in private. 'Audrey Redfern seems a decent enough little soul,' said Estelle Harrison. 'There's really nothing offensive about her, to my mind. Garnet Emerson I rather like. I fancy she could be jolly. I'm going to speak to her in a day or two, but not too soon.' 'What do you think of Winona Woodward?' queried Bessie Kirk. 'Much too big an opinion of herself. Began bragging about her scholarship first thing. She needs sitting upon, to my mind.' 'She's pretty!' 'Yes, and she knows it, too!' 'Well, she can't help knowing it. I call her most striking looking. Her eyes are lovely, though I never can make out whether they're dark gray or hazel under those long lashes. Her hair's just the color of bronze, and such a lot of it! It beats Joyce Newton's hollow; besides, Joyce has absolutely white eyelashes.' 'Like a pig's!' laughed Hilda Langley. 'I agree with you that Winona's pretty, but I don't think she'll ever be a chum of mine, all the same.' The result of the stand-off attitude on the part of the rest of the form was the cementing of a close friendship between Winona and Garnet. It seemed natural for the holders of the two County Scholarships to become chums, also they found each other's society congenial. It marked a new epoch for Winona. She had had few friends of her own age. She had been the eldest pupil at Miss Harmon's small school, and her sisters were so much younger than herself that their interests were on a different plane to her own. Garnet, with her merry brown eyes, eager and enthusiastic nature, and amusing tongue, seemed a revelation. The two girls spent every available moment together, and soon waxed confidential on the subject of their home affairs. 'We're all named after precious stones,' said Garnet. 'Pearl, my eldest sister, is classics mistress at a school; Jacinthe is studying for a health visitor, Ruby is at a Horticultural College, and Beryl is secretary at a Settlement. Aren't there a lot of us? All girls too, and not a single brother. I'm the baby of the family! I'd like to go to Holloway, if I can get a scholarship, but that remains to be seen. Meanwhile two years at the High's not so bad, is it? I expect I'm going to enjoy it. Aren't you?' 'Yes, perhaps. If the rest of the form were nicer, I might.' 'Oh, they'll come round! We can't expect them to take us to their bosoms straight off! We're goods on approval.' 'We've as much right here as they have!' grunted Winona. 'But they were here first, and of course that always counts for something. We shall have to show that we're worth our salt before we get any footing in the form. The question is how best to do it.' Winona shook her head. It was beyond her comprehension. 'I had a few tips from Jacinthe,' ruminated Garnet. 'She was Captain the last year she was at school, so she ought to know. You see, we've to steer between Scylla and Charybdis. We mustn't push ourselves forward too violently, or they'll call us cheeky, but on the other hand, if we're content to take a back seat, we may stay there for the rest of the term. Comprenez vous? It's a matter of seizing one's chance. I've an idea floating about in my mind. Do you happen to be anything extra special at singing, or reciting, or acting?' 'I haven't had much practice at acting, but I can play the guitar. Mummie taught me. She lived in Spain for three years when she was a girl, and learnt there.' 'The very thing! How perfectly splendid! I play the mandoline myself, and the two go so well together. Did you bring your guitar with you?' 'No. I didn't think I should have any time for it.' 'But you could write for it, couldn't you?' 'Oh, yes! Mummie would send it to me.' 'Well, this is my idea. You know next week there's to be a big general meeting of the whole school to choose a Games Captain. So far the games department here is rather in its infancy. I've been making enquiries, and there isn't such a thing as a form trophy. There certainly ought to be, to spur on enthusiasm. I'm going to pluck up my courage, tackle one or two members of the Sixth, and suggest that after the meeting we hold a sing-song, and take a collection to provide a form trophy. I don't believe anybody's ever thought of it.' 'Ripping! But what exactly is a sing-song?' 'Oh, just an informal concert. I thought if you and I played the mandoline and guitar together, it would make a good item. I see two of the prefects coming along over there, I believe I'll go and ask them.' 'I admire your courage!' Garnet returned in a few minutes, tolerably well satisfied with her mission. 'I believe the idea will catch on,' she announced. 'Of course I couldn't expect them to say 'yes' immediately. They were very cautious, and said they would put it to the form. I've sown the seed at any rate, and we must wait for developments.' Apparently Garnet's proposition proved acceptable to the Sixth, for the very next day a notice was pinned on the board in the hall:         'There will be a General Meeting of the School on Tuesday,         October 4th, at 3 p.m., for the purpose of electing a Games         Captain.         'The meeting will be followed by a Symposium, when a collection         will be taken, the proceeds of which will be devoted to the         purchase of a form trophy.         'Performers kindly submit their names without delay to M.         HOWELL, as the program is being made up.' Garnet was one of the first to read the notice, and she started off at once to the Sixth Form room. She sought out Winona on her return. 'So my little scheme's come off!' she beamed. 'You bet the Sixth will take all the credit for evolving it, but I don't care! I've put our names down for a mandoline and guitar duet, and said we'd be ready to help with any accompaniments they like. Meg Howell just jumped at that. It seems Patricia Marshall and Clarice Nixon are going to sing a Christy Minstrel song, and she thought our instruments would add to the effect no end. I tell you we shall score. Did you write for your guitar?' 'Yes, I expect it will be sent off to-day.' 'Then we must begin and practice. I've got a topping duet that's quite easy. Can you come home with me after school to-morrow for half an hour or so? I know my cousins will be glad to see you. Then we might try over one or two things, and see how they go.' 'It will be all right if I tell Aunt Harriet I shall be late,' agreed Winona. The instrument arrived the same evening, so she was able to keep her promise to Garnet next day. Fortunately they had only one class that afternoon, and were able to leave school at half-past three. Garnet's cousins lived within a short tramcar ride. They were musical people, and sympathized with her project. Garnet led Winona into the drawing-room, and began without waste of time. 'Let me look at your guitar! Oh, what a beauty! What's the label inside? Juan Da Costa, Seville! Then it must be Spanish. I suppose they're the best. My mandoline's Italian; it was made in Milan. We must tune them together, mustn't we? Can you read well? This is the book of duets. I thought this Barcarolle would be easy, it has such a lovely swing about it. Here's the guitar part.' CHAPTER IV The Symposium By the aid of diligent practicing in private, and several rehearsals at Garnet's house, the girls at last got their duet to run smoothly. Garnet was frankly pleased. 'The two instruments go so nicely together! A mandoline's ever so much better played with a guitar accompaniment than with the piano. I say, suppose we were to get an encore!' 'I don't suppose anything of the sort.' 'Don't be too modest. It's as well to be prepared.' 'I'm not going to practice anything more, so I warn you.' 'Well, take something you know, from your own book. This song. I could play the air very softly on the mandoline, and we'd both sing it. That won't give you any extra trouble.' 'It isn't the trouble so much as the state of my fingers. They're getting sore. If I let a blister come, I shan't be able to play at all.' 'Then for goodness' sake don't play any more to-day, and soak your fingers in alum when you get home.' The general meeting on Tuesday was a very important event, for it marked the opening of the winter session of games and guilds. During the first week or ten days of the autumn term the girls had enough to do in settling into the work of their new forms, but now October was come everybody began to think about hockey, and to consider the advisability of beginning rehearsals for various Christmas performances. 'I always hate the end of September,' proclaimed Grace Olliver. 'It's so fine, and the geraniums are still so fresh in the park, that you're deceived into thinking it's still summer, yet when you try to play tennis, you find the courts horrible, and you cut up the grass in half an hour. I'm glad when the leaves all come off, and you know it's autumn, and you look up your hockey jersey, and think what sport you had last winter over 'The Dramatic.' I'm fond enough of cricket, but I'd really rather have winter than summer. On the whole, there's more going on.' 'I'm glad Margaret Howell's head of the school,' replied Evelyn Richards. 'She's A1 at all the guilds, though I don't think she's much chance of being elected Games Captain.' 'All the better. It's quite enough for Margaret to act head. She's good enough at that, I admit. Makes an ideal president. But a girl who's literary isn't generally sporty as well. It stands to reason she can't do both properly.' 'Meg doesn't want to be Games Captain; it's not in her line,' volunteered Beatrice, Margaret's younger sister. 'She told me to tell you all to vote for Kirsty Paterson.' 'Kirsty's topping!' 'What's this Symposium we're to have after the meeting?' asked Grace. 'Why, I don't exactly know,' laughed Evelyn. 'I looked 'symposium' up in the dictionary, and it said: 'literally a drinking together; a merry feast; a convivial party.' I don't know what we're going to drink, unless we bring lemon kali and pass it round, like they used to do the loving cup in the Middle Ages!' 'I suppose it'll be just a kind of concert. But how about the collection? What are we supposed to give?' 'Anything you like, from a penny upwards,' replied Beatrice. 'Meg calculated that two hundred and six pennies would be seventeen and twopence, and some girls will probably give more, so she thinks we're sure of a sovereign, and that ought to buy a decent trophy, something to begin upon, at any rate. One must make a start.' 'Right you are! A penny won't break the banks of even the First Form babes, and millionaires can give their half-crowns, if they're so disposed!' Punctually at 3 p.m. on the following Tuesday, the whole school assembled in the gymnasium. No mistress was present, for on occasions such as this Miss Bishop believed in self-government. She could trust her head girl and prefects, and had armed them with full authority. Winona anticipated the meeting with excitement and curiosity. It was altogether outside her experience. She had never in her life attended such a function. Garnet, whose elder sisters had been at large schools, had sketched an outline of what was likely to take place, but even Garnet's information was second-hand. Though she had now been exactly a fortnight at Seaton, Winona still felt more or less of a new-comer. She had hardly spoken to any one outside her own form, and knew the names of comparatively few of her two hundred and five schoolfellows. Without Garnet she would have been quite at a loss how to steer her course in this great ocean of school life; she thankfully accepted her friend as pilot, and for the present was content to follow her lead. The two girls presented themselves in the gymnasium in good time, and took their seats among the other members of V.a. The front bench was occupied by a row of ten-year-olds who had come up this term from the Preparatory, and who sat squeezing each others' arms, highly impressed with the importance of their remove. Behind them Form II., a giggling crew rather more  au fait  with the ways of the school, effervesced occasionally into excited squeals, and were instantly suppressed by a prefect. The Third and Fourth, which comprised the bulk of the girls from twelve to fifteen, occupied the middle of the hall, a lively, self-confident and rather obstreperous set, all at that awkward age which is anxious to claim privileges, but not particularly ready to submit to the authorized code. Every one of them was talking at the extreme pitch of her voice, and the noise was considerable. Patricia Marshall and Clarice Nixon looked at each other and frowned ominously, but as the hands of the big clock pointed almost to three, they judged it better not to interfere, and the din continued. At the stroke of the hour, Margaret Howell strode on to the platform. She was a tall, fine-looking girl of seventeen, with bright hazel eyes, regular features, and a thick brown plait that fell below her waist. Her ready powers of speech, clear ringing voice, brisk decisive tone, and a certain personal magnetism showed her to be that  rara avis , a born leader. It was fortunate indeed for the school that its headship this year should have fallen to Margaret. The need for a firm but judicious hand on the reins was great. During the two previous years of the school's existence the self-government had been in a state of evolution. For the first year, when everybody was new together, comparatively little could be done. The school must find itself before it began to form its private code of laws. In the second year ill-luck had raised to the post of honor Ivy Chatterton, a clever but most untactful girl, whose quick temper had brought her into constant collision with her prefects. Many were the squalls which had swept over the school, of so serious a nature sometimes as almost to wreck several of the guilds. The younger girls, following the example of their elders, had quarreled hotly, and indulged in an incredible amount of petty spite, and altogether the current tone had been anything but desirable. Miss Bishop, who had seen, to her sorrow, this downward trend, had welcomed the advent of Margaret, believing her to have the ability to cope with difficult situations, and at the same time to have the grit and self-control not to allow her head to be turned by her elevation to office. 'You will have a great responsibility: I am giving you unusual power, and I trust that you will make the highest use of it,' she had said to the girl, during a certain quiet ten minutes' talk in her study, and Margaret had held herself very straight, and had answered: 'I'll do my level best, Miss Bishop!' All eyes were now fixed on the head girl as she stood in the center of the platform, ringing the bell for silence. The clamor subsided as if by magic, and in the midst of a dead hush she began her speech. 'Girls! We've been back now for a whole fortnight, time for most of us to shake down into our places, isn't it? The school year's fairly started, and we've met together this afternoon to talk about a number of things that are of very great importance to us all. You all know that a school, to be worth anything, has two sides. There's the inside part, with classes and prep. and exams., what's generally called the 'curriculum', that's managed by the mistresses. And there's the outside part, the games and sports and concerts and guilds, that's run by the girls themselves. Now I think, if we arrange well, we ought to be able to look forward to three very jolly terms. Everything depends upon making a good start. I've been getting to know how they manage in several other big schools, and I propose that we frame our code by theirs. What we want first of all is a feeling of unity and public spirit. Each girl must make up her mind to do all she can to push on the 'Seaton High.' We want to win matches, and have a good sports record, and generally build up a reputation. Slacking at games must be out of the question. Everybody must buck up all round. Those who aren't playing themselves can show their interest by attending the matches. It makes the greatest difference to an eleven to know that their own side is watching their play, and ready to cheer them on. There's nothing so forlorn and depressing as to see whole rows of the enemy's school hats on the spectators' benches, and only half-a-dozen of one's own, yet that's what happened when we played Harbury last spring. No wonder we lost! I'm going to ask you presently to elect a Games Captain, and then I want you to support her loyally for the whole of the year. Let her feel that she can depend upon you, and that instead of getting together scratch teams, her difficulty will be how to choose among so many crack players. But as you know, games are not the whole of our business to-day. We have our guilds to consider as well. I want to put these upon a good and firm basis. Last winter we didn't quite know where we were with them, did we? At present we have 'The Dramatic Society,' 'The Debating Club,' 'The Literary Association,' and 'The Patriotic Knitting Guild.' We might very well add a 'Photographic Union' and a 'Natural History League.' They ought all to be run on the same lines. Each must have a President, a Secretary, and a Committee of eight members, who will undertake the business of the Society, and settle all its events. Any difficulty or dispute must be referred to the Prefects' meeting, the decision of which shall be final. Each guild must draw up a list of its own rules; these must be submitted first to the Prefects, then, if passed as satisfactory, they must be written in the minutes book, and strictly adhered to. I want you all to realize that this school is still in its infancy. It's a baby of only two years! But a very promising baby! It's we who are going to make its history. So far we can't say it has had any annals; in the future it must show a whole splendid list of achievements and successes. Years afterwards, when it's the most famous school in the county, we shall be proud to have had the privilege of taking our share in pushing it on, and our names may be handed down to long generations of girls as those who founded its best traditions.' Margaret paused, quite out of breath with her long speech. A storm of applause rose from the audience; the girls clapped and stamped, a few even cheered. Margaret had touched the right string. The idea of making school history appealed to them, and they were ready to respond with enthusiasm to her appeal. Even the ten-year-olds were eager to show their zeal. Winona had never taken her eyes off the speaker. It was a new gospel to her that she was one of the great community, bound to help the common weal. The realization of it stirred her spirit; her imagination danced ahead, and performed prodigies. Suppose she could do something wonderful for the school, and leave her name as a memory to others? The vision gleamed golden. It would be worth living to accomplish that. 'Not half a bad speech!' murmured Garnet approvingly by her side. Winona started, and came back from the clouds. 'I think it's, just immense!' she answered with a long sigh of admiration. Margaret was again ringing the bell for silence. 'I'm glad to find you all agree with me,' she announced. 'Now I want us to get solidly to business, and elect a Games Captain. You remember I asked each to nominate a candidate, and I find that more than two-thirds have handed in the same name, that of Kirsty Paterson. I therefore put Kirsty up for election. It's only fair that I should first go over her qualifications for the office. She was our best center forward last year at hockey, and our best bowler at cricket. She's a thoroughly steady and reliable player herself, and, this is most important, she's able to train others. You know from experience that she's fair and just, and she's tremendously keen. I feel sure that in her hands the games would prosper, and we'd soon show some improvement. Will all those in favor of electing Kirsty kindly stand up?' There was such a general rising among the girls that most presidents would have considered the matter settled. Margaret, however, liked to do things strictly in order. 'Thanks I Will you please sit down again. Now those against the election kindly stand.' A certain section in the school had intended to vote against Kirsty, but when they saw themselves so enormously outnumbered, they changed their minds. To belong to a minority often means to be unpopular, and it is wise to go with the stream. After all, Kirsty was a thoroughly eligible and desirable candidate. So though a few neighbors elbowed each other, nobody rose. Margaret waited a moment. 'Do I understand that you're all in favor? Then the motion is carried unanimously. I'm very glad, for I think Kirsty will make an ideal captain. Let's give three cheers for her. Are you ready? Hip-hip-hip hooray!' The girls responded with full lung power. Some even began to sing: 'For she's a jolly good fellow!' and there was a general outcry of 'Speech! Speech!' The blushing Kirsty, a bonny, rosy, athletic looking lassie, was seized by her fellow prefects, and dragged, in spite of her protests, to the front of the platform. Kirsty had been born north of the Tweed, and in moments of excitement her pretty Scottish burr asserted itself. 'It's verra kind of you to elect me,' she began. 'I'm afraid I'm no hand at making speeches. I preferr deeds to worrds. We'll all put ourr shoulderrs to the wheel, and win forr the school, won't we? I hope we'll have a splendid yearr!' At that she retired amidst rapturous applause. Margaret again rang the bell for silence, and proceeded with the business of the meeting, which was to elect the officers for the various societies and guilds. This being satisfactorily settled, she turned to affairs of lighter moment. 'I'm sure you'll all agree that it is very desirable for us to have a form trophy, for hockey, at any rate. Perhaps by next summer we'll get one for cricket as well. It will spur us on to have a little wholesome competition amongst ourselves. As I announced on the notice board, we are now going to give a short entertainment, at the close of which a collection will be taken for the object I have just mentioned. I hate begging, so give what you like, but of course it depends on your generosity this afternoon what kind of a trophy we are able to buy. The first item on our program is a piano solo by Hester King.' Hester was one of the best music pupils in the school. She had a good crisp touch and considerable execution, and led off the concert with a sprightly tarantella. A violin solo followed, by Sibyl Lee, a member of V.b., who was rather nervous, but acquitted herself fairly well on the whole. 'I thought I'd break down,' she confided to her friends. 'The sight of all those eyes staring at me quite put me off. I don't wonder blind musicians are generally successes, they can't see the audience. Well, never mind, I've done my bit, at any rate!' The next on the list was a song from Annie Hardy. She had chosen 'Keep the Home Fires Burning,' and rendered it with great effect, the whole room joining with enthusiasm in the chorus. It took so well that there were shouts of 'Encore!' and Annie came back smiling to give 'Khaki Boys,' which roused her audience to an even higher pitch of patriotic fervor. A recitation, 'Our Hockey Match,' by Agnes Heath, was felt to be particularly appropriate to the occasion. It was a very good 'school piece,' humorous as well as exciting, and Agnes had enough dramatic ability to do justice to it. Her own form in particular stamped lustily. The prefects motioned her forward again, but she shook her head. The clapping redoubled. Agnes, escorted to the front by Margaret, bowed and announced: 'Fearfully sorry not to oblige, but this is absolutely the only thing I know, and it's too long to say all over again!' There was a general laugh, and the audience settled itself to enjoy the next item on the program. Margaret was signaling to Winona and Garnet, and the pair slipped from their places, and made their way to the platform. 'I'm all upset! I hope I shan't break down!' whispered Winona. 'Nonsense! A duet's not so bad as a solo. You'll get on all right. Do for goodness' sake brace up!' implored Garnet. 'If you muddle your accompaniment you'll spoil my part. You'll surely never go and fail me!' The instruments had been put under the piano. Patricia Marshall handed them forth, and sounded the notes for them to be tuned. Clarice Nixon was placing chairs and music-stands. Garnet was tolerably composed, but Winona was suffering from a bad attack of that most unpleasant malady 'stage fright.' She would have given worlds for a trapdoor in the platform to open, and allow her to subside out of sight. No such convenient arrangement, however, had been provided for the use of bashful performers, the planks were solid, and guaranteed not to give way under any circumstances. There was nothing for it but to take her seat in full view of the audience. There were slightly over two hundred girls in the room, but to Winona's fevered imagination there appeared to be thousands. She wondered how she could ever have had the folly to place herself in such a public situation. Garnet was sounding a few notes and looking at her to begin. For one dreadful moment the room whirled. Perhaps Margaret saw and understood; she laid her hand on Winona's shaking arm, and whispered encouragingly: 'Go on! Don't mind the audience. Just remember that you're playing for the form trophy!' A sudden revulsion of feeling swept over Winona. All the school patriotism aroused within her by Margaret's speech surged up to meet the crisis. She was no longer an isolated atom, a girl fresh from home, and on trial before the critical eyes of her new form, but a unit in the great life of the school, bound to play her part for the good of the whole, and specially pledged not to fail Garnet in this emergency. Self faded in the larger vision. The color flooded back into her face. She made a desperate effort, and struck the opening chords. As her friend had reminded her, a duet was quite a different matter from a solo. Directly the mandoline part began, her confidence returned. She tried to think that she was only playing an accompaniment for Garnet. The piece was not difficult, it was in D, quite the easiest key for the guitar, with very few accidentals or high positions. She took courage, and struck her strings crisply, so that the tone rang out well. Her instrument was a good one, very true and mellow, and her mother had taught her the liquid Spanish touch which showed it to its best advantage. Garnet also was doing her best. Her plectrum vibrated evenly and rapidly, and the metallic twang, her gravest fault, was not nearly so evident as usual. The audience, unfamiliar with these particular instruments, was not hypercritical, and so long as the players kept well together, and sounded no discords, their skill was judged to be excellent. The Barcarolle had an attractive swing about it, and a romantic suggestion of gondolas and lapping water and moonlight serenades. As the last notes of the air on the mandoline died away, Winona swept her thumb over the strings of her guitar in a tremendous final chord. It had quite a magnificent and professional effect. There was no mistake about the applause; it was simply clamorous. 'Stand up and bow!' whispered Margaret, nudging the unaccustomed performers. 'That's right! Bow again! It's most clearly an encore. Have you brought anything else with you? Good biz! Don't waste any more time, then. We're rather late.' The song that Winona had chosen was a bright little Irish ditty, with a catchy tune and lively accompaniment. Garnet played the air softly on the mandoline, and the two girls sang in unison, keeping strictly together, and pronouncing very plainly, so that the point of the amusing words should not be lost. The audience shrieked with laughter, and would have demanded a further encore, had not Margaret pointed to the clock, and shaken her head firmly. There were other items on the program and time was going all too fast. Another violin solo, a recitation and a Highland fling followed; then the concert wound up with a Christy Minstrel song from several members of the Sixth. This last was the triumph of the afternoon. Patricia prided herself on her preparations. She had placed a newspaper inside the grand piano over the strings, and when the hammers struck against it the effect of the accompaniment was exactly that of a banjo. She had borrowed two sets of castanets, a pair of cymbals, and a triangle, and with these loud-sounding instruments she and her companions emphasized the chorus. Garnet and Winona helped with mandoline and guitar, so the general result was quite orchestral. During the performance of this chef-d'oeuvre some of the prefects went round with collecting bags, which were passed along the benches.     'Come, my dark-eyed honey,     And help to spend my money,' chanted the minstrels lustily, and the audience smiled at the appropriateness of the words. It was felt that the Symposium had been an enormous success. The girls were quite loath to leave, and dispersed slowly from the gymnasium. Many eyes were turned on Winona and Garnet as they carried their instruments down from the platform. 'Who are they?' every one was asking, for so far their names were not known outside their own form. 'The two County Scholarship holders,' somebody replied, and the information was passed on. Next morning, Margaret proudly posted up the result of the collection, which amounted to £2 13 s.  7 d. , a very substantial sum in the estimation of the school. 'It ought to be sufficient to buy a cup!' she triumphed. 'Miss Bishop has promised to send for some catalogues, so that we can look up the prices. We shall start the season well, at any rate. Kirsty's almost ready to stand on her head! I never saw any one so elated!' 'Except yourself!' smiled Patricia. 'Cela va sans dire, camarade!' Garnet and Winona, walking down the High Street together after the performance, also compared notes. 'It was fine! I do admire Margaret. Mustn't it be splendid to be head of the school?' sighed Garnet enviously. 'Do you think so? Yes, I suppose it is, but if I had my choice, I'd a dozen times over rather be Games Captain,' answered Winona. CHAPTER V Aunt Harriet It is high time now that we paused to consider a very important person indeed in this story, namely Miss Harriet Beach, but for whose invitation Winona would never have attended Seaton High School at all. Aunt Harriet was what is generally known as 'a character,' that is to say, she was possessed of a strong personality, and was decidedly eccentric. Though her age verged on sixty she preserved the energy of her thirties, and prided herself upon her physical fitness. She was tall, with a high color, keen brown eyes, a large nose, a determined mouth, and iron gray hair. In her youth she must have been handsome, and even now her erect figure and dark, well-marked eyebrows gave her a certain air of distinction. She was a most thoroughly capable woman, reliable, and strongly philanthropic: not in a sentimental way, however; she disapproved of indiscriminate almsgiving, and would have considered it a crime to bestow a penny on a beggar without making a proper investigation of his case. She was a tower of strength to most of the charitable institutions in the city, a terror to the professional pauper, but a real friend to the deserving. Her time was much occupied with committees, secretarial duties, district visiting, workhouse inspection and other public interests. She was apt indeed to have more than her share of civic business; her reputation for absolute reliability caused people to get into the habit of saying 'Oh, go to Miss Beach!' on every occasion, and as she invariably proved the willing horse, she justified the proverb and received the work in increased proportions. Like most people, Aunt Harriet had her faults. She was apt to be a trifle overbearing and domineering, she lacked patience with others' weaknesses, and was too doctrinaire in her views. She tried very hard to push the world along, but she forgot sometimes that 'the mills of God grind slowly,' and that it is only after much waiting and many days that the bread cast upon the waters returns to us. She prided herself on her candor and lack of 'humbug.' Unfortunately, people who 'speak their minds' generally treat their hearers to a sample of their worst instead of their best, and their excessive truthfulness scarcely meets with the gratitude they consider it deserves. Miss Beach's many estimable qualities, however, overbalanced her crudities, her friends shrugged their shoulders and told each other it was 'her way,' 'her heart was all right.' Though she might give offense, people forgot it, and came to her again next time they wanted anything done, and the universal verdict was that she was 'trying at times,' but on the whole one of the most useful citizens which Seaton possessed. If there was one person more than another who wore out Miss Beach's patience it was her niece and goddaughter, Mrs. Woodward. She had a sincere affection for her, but their two personalities were at absolutely opposite poles. She admitted that Florita was amiable, well-meaning, and thoroughly affectionate, but for the rest she considered her weak, foolishly helpless, liable to extravagance, a poor housekeeper, and a perfect jelly-fish in her methods of bringing up her family. In vain did Aunt Harriet, on successive visits, preach firmness, order, consistency and other maternal virtues; her niece would brace herself up to a temporary effort, but would relax again directly her guest had departed, and the children, little rogues!, discovered at a remarkably early age that they could do pretty much as they liked. The Woodwards always dreaded the advent of Aunt Harriet, her disapproval of their general conduct was so manifest. By dint of urging from their mother they made extra attempts at good behavior before the august visitor, but they were subject to awful relapses. Mrs. Woodward, on her side, considered she had her trials, for her aunt had a habit of arriving suddenly, giving only a few hours' notice by telegram, and she could not forbear the suspicion that her revered godparent wished to surprise her housekeeping and catch her unprepared. On one occasion, indeed, when the family came down, rather late, for breakfast, Aunt Harriet was discovered sitting on the rustic seat outside the dining-room window. She explained that she had taken the 5 a.m. workmen's train and had come to spend a long day with them, but not wishing to disturb the house at too early an hour she had remained in the garden enjoying the view until somebody arrived downstairs. In spite of her rather angular attitude, Miss Beach was a very kind and generous friend to her widowed niece, and she was the one person in the world to whom Mrs. Woodward naturally thought of turning in time of trouble. Aunt Harriet's advice might not always be palatable, but it was combined with such practical help that there seemed no alternative but to follow it. Miss Beach, though not a rich woman, was possessed of very comfortable private means. She lived in an old-fashioned house just opposite the Abbey, and her windows looked out on a view of towers and cloisters and tall lime trees, with a foreground of monuments. To some people the array of tombstones would have proved a dismal prospect, but she declared it never distressed her in the least. She prided herself greatly on the fact that she had been born in the house where her father, grandfather and great-grandfather had also come into the world and spent their lives. Except for an occasional expedition to Highfield, she rarely left home. All her interests were in Seaton, and she became miserable directly if she were away from her native city. The little Woodwards had never regarded it as much of a treat to go and stay at 10, Abbey Close. The restraint which the visit necessitated quite neutralized the afternoon at the cinema with which their aunt invariably entertained them. The fine old Chippendale furniture had to be treated with a respect not meted out to the chairs and tables at home, boots must be scrupulously wiped on the door-mat, bedrooms left tidy, and books and ornaments were to be held altogether sacred from the ravages of prying young fingers. Winona had taken up her residence there with somewhat the feeling of a novice entering a nunnery. She was not quite sure how she and Aunt Harriet were going to get on. To her great relief, however, things turned out better than she expected. Miss Beach received her with unusual complacency, and the two settled down quite harmoniously together. The fact was that Winona, a visitor with nothing to do, and Winona a busy High School girl, were utterly different persons. It is one thing to wander round somebody else's house and feel bored, and quite another to hang up your hat, realize you are part and parcel of the establishment, and occupy yourself with your own business. Once she had fallen into the swing of work at school Winona began to appreciate the orderliness of her aunt's arrangements. It had never seemed to matter at home if the breakfast were late and she arrived at Miss Harmon's when the clock had struck nine, but at 'The High' it was an affair of vital importance to be in her seat before call-over, and she daily blessed the punctuality of Aunt Harriet's cook. It was also a great boon to be able to prepare her lessons in quiet. Her family had never realized the necessity of silence during study hours, and she had been used to learn French vocabularies or translate her Latin exercises to a distracting accompaniment of Ernie's trumpet, Dorrie's and Mamie's quarrels, Godfrey's mouth organ, and Letty's strumming upon the piano. 'It would have been utterly impossible to do my prep. at home!' she thought sometimes. 'I'd no idea what work was like before I came to Seaton 'High'! It would do those youngsters good to have a drilling! I wish they could have been in the Preparatory. No, I don't! Because then I should have had them here, and it would have been good-by to all peace. On the whole things are much better as they are.' Miss Beach was so extremely busy with her own multifarious occupations that she had not time to see very much of her great-niece. She made every arrangement for her comfort, however, and caused the piano to be moved into the dining-room for the convenience of her practicing. She had always had a tender spot for Winona, whom she regarded as the one hopeful character in a family of noodles. She talked to her at meal times about a variety of subjects, some of them within her intelligence, but others completely, so far, above her head. She even tried to draw her out upon school matters. This, however, was a dead failure. Winona, most unfortunately, could not overcome her awe for her aunt, and refused to expand. To all the questions about her Form, her companions, teachers, lessons or new experiences, she replied in monosyllables. It was a sad pity, for Miss Beach had really hoped to win the girl's confidence and prove a temporary mother to her, but finding her advances repulsed she also shrank back into her shell, and the intimacy which might have existed between them was postponed to future years. Young folks often fail to realize what an interest their doings may have to grown-up people, and how their bright fresh outlook on life may come as a tonic to older and wearier minds. It never struck Winona to try to amuse or entertain her aunt. At her present crude stage of development she was incapable of appreciating the subtle pathos that clings round elderly lives, and their wistful longing to be included in the experiences of the rising generation. Shyness and lack of perception held her silent, and the empty corner in Aunt Harriet's heart went unfilled. Saturday and Sunday were the only days upon which Winona had time to feel homesick. Her mother had at first suggested her returning to Highfield for the week ends, but Miss Beach had strongly vetoed the project on the justifiable ground that even the earliest train from Ashbourne on Monday mornings did not reach Seaton till 9.30, so that Winona would lose the first hour's lesson of her school week. She might have added that she considered such frequent home visits would prove highly unsettling and interfere greatly with her work, but for once she refrained from stating her frank opinion, probably deeming the other argument sufficient, and willing to spare Mrs. Woodward's feelings. Letters from Highfield showed little change in the usual conduct of family affairs. The children were still attending Miss Harmon's school, though they were to leave at Christmas. 'We are late nearly every day now you are not here to make Ernie start,' wrote Mamie, almost as if it were an achievement to be proud of. 'He locked the piano and threw the key in the garden, and we could none of us practice for three days. Wasn't it lovely? Letty pours out tea if mother isn't in, and yesterday she broke the teapot.' The chief items of news, however, concerned Percy. That young gentleman, with what Aunt Harriet considered his usual perversity, had sprained his ankle on the very day before he ought to have returned to school. He had been ordered to lie up on the sofa, but Winona gathered that the doctor's directions had not been very strictly carried out. She strongly suspected that the patient did not wish to recover too quickly. Whether or not that had been the case, Percy was now convalescent, and was to set off for school on the following Friday. Longworth College was not a great distance, and as Percy would have to pass through Seaton on his way, Aunt Harriet invited him to break his journey there and spend the night at her house. She had a poor opinion of the boy's capacity, but having undertaken a half share in his education she felt an increased sense of responsibility towards him, and wished to find an opportunity of a word with him in private. Winona hailed her brother's advent with immense joy. Even so flying a visit was better than nothing. Letters were an inadequate means of expression, and she was longing to pour out all her new experiences. She wanted to tell Percy about the Symposium, and her friendship for Garnet, and the chemistry class, and the gymnasium practice, and to show him her hockey jersey which had just arrived. She had so long been the recipient of all his school news that it would be delightful to turn the tables and give him a chronicle of her own doings at the Seaton 'High,' which in her opinion quite rivaled Longworth College. To the young people's scarcely suppressed satisfaction, Miss Beach went out after tea to attend an important meeting, leaving her nephew and niece to spend the evening alone together. They had never expected such luck. As it was Friday Winona had no lessons to prepare for the next day, and could feel free for a delightful chat. She flung herself into Aunt Harriet's special big easy chair by the fireside, and lounged luxuriously, while Percy, boy-like, prowled about the room. 'Well, I'm glad you're jogging along all right,' he remarked when his sister's long account came to a pause. 'Though please don't for a moment compare your blessed old High School to Longworth, for they're not in the same running! Aunt Harriet hasn't quite eaten you up yet, I see?' 'She's not such a Gorgon as I expected. In fact she's been rather decent.' 'The dragon's sheathed her talons? Well, that's good biz. You went off as tragic as Iphigenia, heroically declaring yourself the family sacrifice.' 'Did I?' Winona had almost forgotten her original attitude of martyr. Three weeks had made a vast difference to her feelings. 'If you can peg it out in comfort with the dragon so much to the good. Shouldn't care to live here myself though. It's a dull hole. Number 10, Abbey Close wouldn't be my choice of a residence.' 'Well, it's not likely you'll ever have the chance of living here!' retorted Winona, taking up the cudgels for her adopted home. 'I don't know about that,' returned Percy. 'The house belongs to Aunt Harriet. She'll have to leave her property to somebody, I suppose, when she shuffles off this mortal coil. I'm the eldest son, and my name's Percy Beach Woodward. That ought to count for something.' 'Aunt Harriet's not going to die yet,' said Winona gravely. 'I think it's horrid of you to talk like this!' 'Oh, I don't wish the old girl any harm, but one may have an eye to the future all the same,' was the airy response. 'D'you remember Jack Cassidy who was a pupil at the Vicarage? His aunt left him five thousand pounds.' 'Yes, and I heard he's muddling it away as fast as he can. Mary James told me. Her father's guardian of part of his property until he's twenty-five, you know.' 'He's a topper, is Jack! He's promised to take me for a day sometime to Hartleburn, when the races are on. Now don't you go blabbing, or I'll never tell you anything again!' 'Mr. Joynson said, ' 'Oh, for goodness sake shut up! A boy of sixteen isn't going to be bear-led by an old fogey like Joynson. He has the mater far too much under his finger and thumb for my taste. If you want to be chums with me, don't preach!' Winona was silent. Her brother's infatuation for the Vicar's scapegrace ward was the affair of a year ago. She had hoped he had forgotten it. His escapades at the time, in company with his hero, had caused his mother to seek the advice and guidance of her trustee. 'Some one was telling me the other day that old oak furniture is worth a tremendous lot of money now,' continued Percy, his eye roving round the room with an air almost of future proprietorship. 'If that's so these things of Aunt Harriet's are a little gold mine. There was an account of a sale in the newspaper, with a picture of a cupboard that fetched two hundred pounds. It was first cousin to that!' nodding at a splendidly carved old piece which faced him. Miss Beach's household goods were inherited from her great-grandfather, and included some fine specimens of oak, as well as rare Chippendale. Winona was too young to be a connoisseur of antiquities, but she had the curiosity to rise from her chair and join Percy in his inspection of the article in question. 'I tell you they're as alike as two peas!' he declared. 'Same shape, same sort of carving, same knobs at the end! The reason why I remember the thing is that the buyer found a secret drawer in it after he'd got it home, with some old rubbish inside, and there was a lawsuit as to who owned these. He claimed he'd bought the lot with the cupboard, but the judge made him turn them up to the family of the original owner. That was why there was a picture of the cupboard in the newspaper. It put an arrow showing the place of the secret drawer. I wonder if there's one here, too? I'm going to have a try! By Jove, there is!' A vigorous pull had dislodged a drawer in a very unexpected situation. Winona would certainly never have thought of its existence, nor would Percy, if the newspaper had not given away the secret. He looked eagerly inside. 'No treasures hidden in here! Absolutely nothing at all, except this piece of paper.' 'Perhaps Aunt Harriet has never found it out,' ventured Winona. Percy did not answer immediately. He was reading the writing on the paper. 'You bet she has!' he cried at last, flushing angrily. 'I never thought she'd much opinion of me, but I call this the limit! It's going where it deserves!' and acting on a sudden impulse he flung the cause of offense into the fire. For a moment Winona did not realize what he had done. By the time she reached the hearth the paper was already half consumed. She made a snatch at it with the tongs, but a flame sprang up and forestalled her. She had just time to read the words 'last Will and Testament of me Har, ' before the whole sank into ashes. She turned to her brother with a white, scared face. 'Percy! You've never burnt Aunt Harriet's will?' Ashamed already of his impetuous act the boy nevertheless tried to bluff the matter off. 'It was an abominable shame! When I'm named Beach after her too! I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't read it myself!' he blustered. 'Read what?' 'I shan't tell you! Look here, Win, you must promise on your honor that you'll never breathe a word about this.' 'Perhaps Aunt Harriet ought to know.' 'She mustn't know:  mustn't , I tell you! I say, Win, I'm not at all sure that what I've just done isn't a chargeable offense, I believe they call it a felony. You wouldn't like to see me put into prison, would you? Then hold your tongue about it! Give me your word! Can you keep a secret?' 'I promise!' gasped Winona (Percy was squeezing her little finger nail in orthodox fashion and the agony was acute). 'I promise faithfully.' She was in a terrible quandary. Her natural straightforwardness urged her to make a clean breast of the whole affair. Had she been the actual transgressor she would certainly have done so and faced the consequences. But this was Percy's secret, not her own. He was no favorite with his aunt, and so outrageous an act would prejudice him fatally in her eyes. The hint about prison frightened Winona. She knew nothing of law, but she thought it highly probable that burning a will was a punishable crime. Suppose Aunt Harriet's rigid conscience obliged her to communicate with the police and deliver Percy into the hands of justice. Such a horrible possibility must be avoided at all costs. The sound of a latch-key in the door made her start. In a panic she rushed to the old cupboard and pushed back the secret drawer into its place. When Miss Beach entered the dining-room her nephew and niece were sitting reading by the fireside. Their choice of literature might perhaps have astonished her, for Percy was poring over Sir Oliver Lodge's 'Man and the Universe,' while Winona's nose was buried in Herbert Spencer's 'Sociology,' but if indeed she noticed it, she perhaps set it down to a laudable desire to improve their minds, and placed the matter to their credit. Percy took his departure next morning, and Winona saw him off at the railway station. 'Remember, you've to keep that business dark,' he reminded her. 'Aunt Harriet must never find out. She's been jawing me no end about responsibility, and looking after the kids and supporting the mater and all that. Rubbed it in hard, I can tell you! Great Juggins! Do I look like the mainstay of a family?' As Winona watched his boyish face laughing at her from the window of the moving train she decided that he certainly did not. She sighed as she turned to leave the station. Life seemed suddenly to have assumed new perplexities. Percy's act weighed heavily on her mind. It seemed such a base return for all Aunt Harriet was doing on their behalf. She longed to thank her for her kindness and say how much she appreciated going to the High School, but she could not find the words. Theknowledge of the secret raised an extra barrier between herself and her aunt. So she sat at lunch time even shyer and more speechless than usual, and let the ball of conversation persistently drop. 'Fretting for her brother, I suppose,' thought Miss Beach. 'She can talk fast enough with friends of her own age. Well, I suppose an old body like myself mustn't expect to be company for a girl of fifteen!' She was too proud to let the hurt feeling show itself on her face, however, and propping up the newspaper beside her plate, she plunged into the latest accounts from the Front. CHAPTER VI A Crisis Winona had been more than a month, nearly five weeks indeed, at the Seaton High School. In the first few days of her introduction to V.a. she had told herself that the difficulty of the work consisted largely in its newness, and that as soon as she grew accustomed to it she would sail along as swimmingly as Garnet Emerson, or Olave Parry, or Hilda Langley, or Agatha James. Most unfortunately she found her theory acted in the opposite direction. Closer acquaintance with her Form subjects proved their extreme toughness. She was not nearly up to the standard of the rest of the girls. Her Latin grammar was shaky, her French only a trifle better, she had merely a nodding acquaintance with geometry, and had not before studied chemistry. Her teacher seemed to expect her to understand many things of which she had hitherto never heard, and was apparently astounded at her ignorance. Winona puzzled over her text-books during many hours of preparation, but she made little headway. The royal road to learning, which she had fondly hoped to tread, was proving itself a stony and twisting path. ' You  seem to get on all right?' she said wistfully to Garnet one day. 'Why, yes. Of course one has to work,' admitted her friend. 'Miss Huntley keeps one up to the mark. But one must expect that in V.a. They don't put scholarship holders in the Preparatory.' 'I was all at sea in math. this morning.' 'You were rather a duffer, certainly. The problems weren't as difficult as the ones they gave us in the entrance exam. If those didn't floor you, why couldn't you work these?' 'But they did floor me. I barely managed half the paper. I reckoned I'd failed in it.' Garnet looked surprised. 'Then your other subjects must have been extremely good to make up for it. I was told that we should probably stand or fall by maths. You were ripping in everything else, I suppose? Scored no end?' Winona did not answer the question. She was conscious that none of her papers could have merited such an eulogium. She envied Garnet's grasp of the form work. Try as she would, her own exercises and translations were poor affairs, and her ill-trained memory found it difficult to marshal the enormous number of facts that were daily forced upon it. Miss Huntley at first was patient, but as the weeks wore on, and Winona still wallowed in a quagmire of amazing mistakes, she grew sarcastic. The girl winced under some of her cutting remarks. Apparently the mistress imagined her failure to be due to laziness and inattention, and sooner than confess that she could not understand the work, Winona was silent. She never mentioned the long hours she spent poring over her books in Aunt Harriet's dining-room. After all, it was better to be thought idle than stupid. But it was humiliating to feel that she was counted among the slackers of the Form, while Garnet was already winning laurels. The contrast between the two scholarship holders could not fail to be noticed. Miss Huntley (privately known to the Form as 'Bunty') was a clever, but rather remorseless teacher. She had been on the staff since the opening of the school two years before, and she was determined at all costs to maintain the high standard inaugurated at its foundation. She was herself the product of High School education, and knew to the last scruple how much to require from girls in V.a. To those who appeared to be really trying their best she was ready to give intelligent help, but she had no mercy for slackers. She was possessed of a certain amount of dry humor, greatly appreciated by the form  en bloc , though each quaked privately lest, through some unlucky slip, she might find herself the object of the smart but withering satires. Despite her strictness, 'Bunty' was popular. She was an admirable tennis player, and a formidable champion in a match 'Mistresses  v.  Girls.' Her strong personality fascinated Winona, who would have done much to gain her approval. So far, however, she was entirely on Miss Huntley's black list. Matters came to a crisis over a difficult bit of Vergil. Latin was, next to mathematics, the most painfully wobbling of Winona's shaky subjects. She had puzzled in vain over this particular piece of translation. The words, indeed, she had found in the dictionary, but she could not twist them into sense. 'Old Vergil's utterly stumped me to-day!' she mourned to Garnet, as they met in the dressing-room before nine o'clock. 'If Bunty puts me to construe anywhere on page 21, I'm a gone coon. I'm feeling in a blue funk, I can tell you.' 'Poor old bluebottle! Don't wrinkle up your forehead like that, you're making permanent lines! It's a bad trick, and just spoils you.' 'I can't help it when I'm worried!' 'Then don't worry.' 'Oh, it's easy enough for you; you don't have to receive the vials of Bunty's scorn.' Winona hoped against hope that the difficult page might fall to somebody else's turn. Miss Huntley took no particular order, but selected girls at random to construe the lesson. In a Form of twenty it was possible not to be chosen at all. Winona kept very quiet, so as not to attract the mistress' attention. Marjorie Kemp and Olave Parry had already translated half of the fatal page, with tolerable credit. Miss Huntley's eye was wandering in the direction of Irene Mills. Winona dared to breathe. Then, alas! alas! Some unlucky star caused the mistress to look back towards the middle of the room. In a spasm of nervousness, Winona jerked her elbow, and away went her pencil-box, clattering on to the floor, and dispersing its collection of pens, pencils, nibs and other treasures beneath the neighboring desks. There was a dead silence, and the culprit was instantly the center of attention. 'A clumsy thing to do! Leave those things where they are! You can pick them up after the lesson,' observed Miss Huntley grimly. 'Go on now with the translation.' Winona's hot face had been hidden under Audrey Redfern's desk. She rose reluctantly. Her confusion made the hard passage seem twice as difficult. Even the words which she had carefully looked up in the dictionary and learned by heart escaped her fickle memory. She stumbled and floundered hopelessly, getting redder and redder with shame. Miss Huntley preserved an ominous silence, and did not attempt to help her out. 'That will do!' she said, at the end of about eight lines. 'After such a complete exhibition of incompetence we won't inflict any more of your bungling upon the form. We must see if we can find a way of sharpening your wits. Your brain seems to have been lying fallow since you came to school! You will report yourself to Miss Bishop at four o'clock this afternoon.' The rest of the morning passed like a bad dream to Winona. It was a rare event for a teacher to send a girl to the head mistress. The prospect of the coming interview made her cold with apprehension. She avoided Garnet at one o'clock, and hurried out of the dressing-room without speaking to any one. She had a wild project of pleading a headache, and begging Aunt Harriet to let her stop at home for the rest of the day. But then to-morrow's explanations would be infinitely worse. No, it was better to face the horrible ordeal and get it over. As it happened, Miss Beach had gone out to lunch, so that leave of absence was an impossibility. Winona ate her early dinner alone. 'Aren't you well, miss? Would you like me to make you a cup of tea?' asked Alice the housemaid, noticing that the pudding was unappreciated, and divining that something must be amiss. 'No, thanks! I'm in a hurry, and must fly off to school as quickly as I can. It's my early afternoon.' Winona had a music lesson at a quarter past two on Thursdays. It was always rather a rush to get back in time for it. She crammed her 'Bach's Preludes' and 'Schubert's Impromptus' automatically into her portfolio, and started. It was only when she was half-way down Church Street that she remembered she had left her book of studies on the top of the piano. Needless to say, her lesson that day was hardly a success. In the disturbed state of her mind she was quite incapable of concentrating her attention on music. Miss Catteral looked surprised at her wrong notes and imperfect phrasing. 'I shall expect to find some improvement in this 'Impromptu' next week,' she remarked. 'Have you practiced your hour daily? You must take these bars, which I have marked, separately, and play each twenty times in succession, slowly at first and then faster, and remember here that it is the left hand which gives the melody, and the right is only the accompaniment. I thought you had sufficient music in you to appreciate that! The way you thumped out those chords was painful. I am not pleased at all.' Miss Catteral so rarely scolded that Winona felt doubly humiliated. It was all a part and parcel of the general ill-luck of the day. She fetched her drawing-board, and went to the art class. Here at least she would have peace for an hour, though every one of the sixty minutes was bringing her nearer to her dreaded interview. At four o'clock, with a horrible sinking feeling in her heart, and a trembling sensation in her knees, she knocked at the door of the head-mistress's study, and entered in response to the 'Come in!' which followed. Miss Bishop looked up from some papers, motioned her to a chair, and went on writing for several minutes. To Winona it seemed worse than waiting at the dentist's. The suspense was ghastly. At last the Principal paused, laid down her pen, and blotted her pages. 'Come here, Winona Woodward,' she said quietly. 'I wish to have a straight talk with you.' Miss Bishop's eyes were her most striking feature. They were large and clear, but the pupils were unusually small, appearing mere black specks in the midst of a wide circle of blue. This peculiarity gave her a particularly intense and penetrating expression. Winona, standing at attention beside the desk, dropped her own eyes before the steady, searching gaze. 'Miss Huntley's report of your work is not at all satisfactory,' began Miss Bishop. 'I have been watching your progress since you joined the school, and I cannot think you are trying your best. At first, when you were totally new to your Form, I suspended judgment, but you have been here nearly half a term now, quite long enough to accustom yourself to our methods. I confess I am greatly disappointed. I had hoped for better things from the holder of a County Scholarship.' Winona remained silent. She could think of nothing to say in self-defense. 'It must be sheer lack of grit and effort,' continued Miss Bishop. 'I cannot understand how a girl who did so remarkably well in the entrance examination can rest content with such a low record. How long do you take over your preparation?' 'Until my aunt sends me to bed,' replied Winona, in a very subdued voice. 'I spend the whole evening at my lessons.' Miss Bishop looked puzzled. 'Then the work must be too difficult for you. If that is the case, I must remove you to V.b.' V.b. was notorious in the school as a refuge for incompetence. It was mainly composed of girls of sixteen and seventeen who could not reach the standard of the Sixth, and who went by the nickname of 'owls' or 'stupids.' The prospect of being relegated to such an intellectual backwater spread palpable dismay over Winona's face. Miss Bishop smiled rather grimly. 'We can't win honors without paying the price! You must know that already by experience. I conclude that you studied hard for the Scholarship examination? Well, your Form work requires equally close application. Here is Miss Huntley's report: 'French, weak; Latin, beneath criticism; mathematics, extremely bad.' Yet in all these three subjects you gained a high percentage in the entrance examination. I have your papers here, yes, Latin 85, French 87, mathematics 92' (rapidly turning over the pages), 'it is simply incredible how you have fallen off.' Winona was gazing at the sheets of foolscap in the Principal's hand. 'Those aren't my papers,' she faltered. 'Certainly they are. They're marked with your number, 11.' 'But I wasn't number 11, I was number 10.' Miss Bishop stooped, opened a drawer in her bureau, and took out a book. 'Here it is in black and white,' she replied. 'No. 11, Winona Woodward.' Winona's shaking hands clutched the edge of the bureau. In a flash the whole horrible truth was suddenly revealed to her. Until that moment she had almost forgotten how she and the ruddy-haired girl had collided at the door of the examination-room, and dropped their cards. In picking them up, they must have effected an exchange. She remembered that she had been too agitated to notice her number until after the accident had happened. She now related the circumstance as best she could. Miss Bishop listened aghast. 'What number did you say you took in the examination-room? Ten? That is entered in my book as Marjorie Kaye. I have the rest of the candidates' papers in this bundle. Let me see, yes, here is No. 10. Is this your handwriting? Then I'm afraid there has been a terrible blunder, and the scholarship has been awarded to the wrong girl.' The Principal's consternation was equalled by Winona's. To the latter the ground seemed slipping from under her feet. She tried to speak, but failed. A great lump rose in her throat. For a moment the room whirled round. 'This set of papers, No. 10, was marked so low as to be out of the running,' continued Miss Bishop. 'It is a most unfortunate mistake, and places the school in an extremely awkward position. I must consult with the Governors at once. Pending their decision, it will be better not to mention the matter to anybody. You may go now.' Winona managed somehow to get herself out of the study, to put on her hat and coat, and to walk home to Abbey Close. Her aunt was still absent, for which she was intensely thankful, and ignoring the tea that was waiting on the dining-room table, she rushed upstairs to her bedroom. Her one imperative need was to be alone. She must face the situation squarely. Her world had suddenly turned topsy-turvy; instead of being the winner of the County Scholarship, she was among the rejected candidates. In her heart of hearts she had always marveled how her indifferent papers could have scored such a success. She wondered this explanation had never occurred to her before. All this time she had been wearing another girl's laurels. What was going to happen next? She supposed the scholarship would be taken from her, and given to its rightful owner. And herself? She would probably be packed home, as Percy had prophesied, 'like a whipped puppy.' Possibly Aunt Harriet might offer to pay her fee as an ordinary pupil at the High School, but in either case the humiliation would be supreme. Winona dreaded returning home. In spite of the difficulty of the work, the High School had opened a fresh world to her. She could never again be content with the old rut. Miss Harmon's dull lessons would be intolerable, and life without Garnet's friendship would seem a blank. The companionship of her three little sisters was totally inadequate for a girl who was fast growing up. She shrank from speculating how her mother would receive the bad news. Mrs. Woodward was one of those parents who expect their children to gain the prizes which they were incapable of winning for themselves. She had claimed a kind of second-hand credit in her daughter's triumph. Winona knew from past experience that so keen a disappointment would involve a string of reproaches, regrets and fretting. She would probably never hear the last of it. The family hopes had been pinned upon her success, and to frustrate them was to court utter disgrace. For the present she must live with this sword of Damocles hanging over her head, but she hoped the Governors would decide the matter speedily, and put her out of her misery. There is one virtue in a supreme trouble, it dwarfs all minor griefs. Percy's secret, which had been felt as a continual burden, seemed to sink into comparative obscurity, and the worry of school work and the dread of Miss Huntley's sarcasm were mere flies in the ointment. Winona never quite knew how she got through the week that followed. It stayed afterwards in her memory as a period of black darkness, a valley of humiliation, in which her old childish self slipped away, and a new, stronger and more capable personality was born to face the future. She had resigned herself so utterly to the inevitable, that when at last Miss Bishop's summons came, she was able to walk quite calmly into the study. The Principal was seated as usual at her bureau; Winona's entrance examination papers lay before her. Her manner was non-committal; her blue eyes looked even more penetrating than usual. 'You will have been wondering what was going to happen about the matter of the scholarship,' she began. 'Yes, Miss Bishop,' answered Winona meekly. She did not add that she had spent eight days in a mental purgatory. 'I of course placed the facts before the Governors, and we at once communicated with the parents of Marjorie Kaye. We find, however, that in the meantime she has been elected a scholar of the Maria Harvey Foundation, and will therefore be unable to accept this scholarship. Her papers and those of Garnet Emerson were the only ones of outstanding merit. In re-examining the remaining eighteen we find a uniform level of mediocrity. As regards your set of papers, the general standard is low, with one exception. We consider that your essay on Lady Jane Grey shows an originality and a capacity for thought which may be worthy of training. On the strength of this, and this alone, the Governors have decided to allow you to retain your scholarship. In so doing they are perfectly within their rights. They did not undertake to grant free tuition to the candidate who scored the highest number of marks, but to the one who, in their opinion, was most likely to benefit by the school course. It was a matter to be settled entirely at their discretion. I have carefully re-read your papers, and compared them with your form record, and I come to the conclusion that you are backward and ill-instructed in many subjects, but that you are not idle or stupid. I shall make arrangements for you to have special coaching in mathematics, Latin and chemistry until you can keep up with the rest of the Form. I find your reports for history and English literature are good, which confirms my opinion that you do not lack ability. You will need to work very hard, especially at those subjects in which you are so deficient, but I trust you will soon show a marked improvement, and thus justify the decision of the Governors. Are you prepared to try?' 'I don't know how to thank you, I'll do my very best!' stammered Winona, quite overcome by this unexpected  dénouement . 'Then that is all that need be said. Miss Lever will take you every day from 3.30 to 4.15 for private tuition. Mark that on your time-table, and go to her this afternoon in the Preparatory Room. You may tell Miss Garside that I am disengaged now, and at liberty to speak to her.' Winona left the study with very different feelings from those with which she had entered. Her spirits were so high that she wanted to dance along the corridor. She could hardly believe her good fortune. Those great and important gentlemen, the Governors, had actually approved of her essay to the extent of allowing it to stand as her qualification for the Scholarship! She blessed Lady Jane Grey, and Edgar Allan Poe, and Browning, and André de Chénier, and the happy chance that had made her combine them all. She was glad she had paid that visit to Hampton Court, and that she had seen Lady Jane Grey's portrait, and had been able to describe both. Life was going to be a very exhilarating business, now her position in the school was once more secure. 'I'll show them how I can work,' she thought. 'They shan't be sorry that they let me stay after all! Oh, I am in luck! Yes, I'm the luckiest girl in the school!' CHAPTER VII An Autumn Foray Winona felt that she now started life at the High School on an entirely new basis. Miss Bishop and Miss Huntley understood her limitations and judged her accordingly. It was not by any means that they lowered their standard, but that they appreciated her difficulty in keeping up with the Form and gave her credit for her hard work. And hard work it undoubtedly was. She would get up early in the morning to revise her lessons before breakfast, and would sit toiling over books and exercises in the evenings till even Aunt Harriet, indefatigable worker herself, would tell her to stop, and wax moral on the folly of burning the candle at both ends. The coaching from Miss Lever was of inestimable value. It supplied just the gaps in which she was deficient, and gave her an adequate grasp of her three toughest subjects. Slowly she began to make headway, she saw light in mathematical problems that had before been meaningless formulæ, chemistry was less of a hopeless tangle, and Vergil's lines construed into understandable sentences instead of utter nonsense. It was only gradual progress, however. She had much ground to cover before she caught up the Form. She was plodding, but not a brilliant all-round scholar like Garnet. The fact was that Winona was only clever in one direction: in the realm of imagination her mind ran like a racehorse, but harnessed to heavy intellectual burdens it proved but a sorry steed. It was fortunate for both her health and her spirits that head work did not represent the only side of school activities. Miss Bishop was wise enough to lay much stress on physical development. A ten minutes' drill was part of the daily routine, a gymnasium practice was held twice a week, and Wednesday afternoons were devoted to hockey. In addition to this the girls played tennis on the asphalt courts during the winter and spring terms, whenever the weather was suitable, and basket ball was constantly going on in the playground. Athletics was decidedly the fashionable cult of the school. Kirsty Paterson, as Games Captain, made it her business to see that nobody slacked without justifiable cause. She would break up knots of chatting idlers, and cajole them forth to 'cultivate muscle' as she expressed it, while her keen eye was quick to note anybody's 'points' and employ them for the general benefit. Kirsty's jolly, breezy manner and strict sense of justice made her an admirable captain. She was highly popular with juniors as well as seniors, for she took the trouble to organize the games of the little girls as carefully as those of their elders. 'It's insane short-sighted policy to neglect the kids,' was her creed. 'Now's the time to be training them. Get them thoroughly well in hand and make them understand what's expected from them, and in four or five years' time they'll be crack players. Yes, I know it's looking far ahead, and we prefects won't be here to see the result, but the school will reap the benefit some day and that's the main thing to aim at. I'm proud of my cadets and, in the future, when they're winning laurels for the Seaton High, perhaps they'll remember I started them on the right track. 'Keep up the standard all round' is going to be the motto while I'm Captain.' To Winona athletics and organized games came as a revelation. She had a slim wiry little figure and was a good runner, with a capacity for keeping her breath, and had also a considerable power of spring, all of which stood her in good stead both in the hockey field and in the gymnasium. Though Kirsty said little, she could feel her efforts were being watched and approved, and the knowledge gave her a tingling sense of satisfaction. It was delightful to feel that she was a factor in this big school, and that she was doing her bit, however insignificant, to help up the athletic standard. In physical agility Winona was superior to Garnet. She could beat her easily at tennis, and there was already a wide gap between their gymnastic achievements. It was a fortunate circumstance, for it just balanced their friendship, and put them on a footing of equality which would have been otherwise absent. Garnet, so manifestly first in Form work, possessed of greater confidence and  savoir faire  in school life and older in experience for her years than Winona, might have monopolized the lead too entirely, had she not been obliged to yield the palm of outdoor sports to her friend. Garnet was, in truth, just a trifle inclined to 'boss.' She liked Winona, and wanted her for a chum, but she loved to lay down the law and to constitute herself an authority upon every possible subject. There was no doubt it was owing to her initiative that the two scholarship-holders were gaining a position for themselves in the school. As Garnet had foreseen, the part they had taken in the Symposium won them favorable recognition. To be singled out as soloists and to have the honor of playing an accompaniment for the prefects had raised them above the common herd, and though a few were jealous, more were ready to extend the hand of good fellowship. In their own Form they were living down the prejudice which had at first existed against them. Hilda Langley and Estelle Harrison were not very friendly and influenced Olave Parry and Mollie Hill against them, but these formed a minority, and the bulk of the girls seemed to have decided in their favor. With the enormous demands made on her time by her home preparation, Winona did not venture to join many of the school guilds. She would have liked immensely to put her name down for election to the Dramatic Society, the Debating Club and the Literary Association, but these all required rather strenuous brain work from their members, and in the circumstances she knew it would be folly to take them up. At some future date, when her ordinary subjects proved less of a burden, she promised herself the pleasure of being numbered among that select clique known as 'The Intellectuals,' but for the present her motto must be 'grim grind.' The Patriotic Knitting Guild seemed more feasible. She paid her subscription, received her skeins of khaki wool, and started mittens to fill up odd moments. She found the knitting a soothing occupation, it could be taken up and laid down so easily; it often went to school with her, and would come out during the interval, or while she was waiting for a class. The Photographic Union was beyond her, for as yet she had no camera, but she thought she was justified in joining the Natural History League. This society did not for the present demand papers from its members, but contented itself with encouraging the collection of objects for the school museum. Its main activities would be during the summer term, though a weather record was kept throughout the year, and any nature notes that were worthy of being written down were duly chronicled in the Field Book. Linda Fletcher and Annie Hardy, two of the prefects, were the leading spirits in the League. Linda was great on entomology, and, having a brother who was interested in the subject, had been out 'sugaring' in his company in August and September, and had secured some fine specimens of moths. She had boxes full of chrysalides which she fondly hoped would emerge in the spring into perfect insects, and she had made quite a good little collection of beetles. Annie was more interested in botany, she pressed flowers and leaves, dried fruits and seed vessels, and made praiseworthy efforts at preserving funguses in bottles, though these latter attempts were not always attended with the success they deserved, as they were apt to acquire a gamey odor, to which her mother very naturally objected, and she would be obliged disconsolately to turn them out into the dust-bin. November happened to be a particularly fine month at Seaton. There had been little rain, and no high winds to blow the leaves away. Though the trees in the city were bare, those in the country round about remained almost in their October glory, and in sheltered woods some were still green. The persistent sunshine encouraged the Natural History League to plan an excursion for its members, and after a consultation with Miss Lever, the Botany mistress, Linda pinned up the following announcement on the school notice board:,  NATURAL HISTORY LEAGUE. An Autumn Foray will be held on Saturday next, visiting Monkend Woods and Copplestone Quarry. Members will meet at station for the 12.45 train to Powerscroft, returning by the 5.30 from Chartwell. Tea at farm-house. Walking distance five miles. Leaders: Miss Lever, Linda Fletcher and Annie Hardy. Those intending to join kindly give their names to the Secretary on Wednesday at latest.                                         L. FLETCHER,                                                     Hon. Sec.  The prospect of a ramble was alluring. Winona was a country lover, so she forthwith secured Aunt Harriet's permission for the outing and placed her name upon the list. 'I don't think there'll be more than a dozen of us altogether,' said Linda, 'but really a small party's more manageable than a big one, and I'll undertake we enjoy ourselves. Miss Lever can get permission for us to walk through the private part of the woods, there's no shooting this autumn, you know, so that will be simply glorious, and she says we ought to find some fossils in the quarry, if we've luck. I hope the weather will keep up. Don't forget to take a vasculum or a basket, and a hammer for fossils, and be sure you put on strong boots. The tea will probably be eightpence a head. Miss Lever is writing beforehand to the farm to make arrangements.' Garnet also was to join the excursion and she promised to call for Winona, so that they might walk to the station together. The latter had an early lunch, and was ready dressed and waiting for her friend by twenty minutes past twelve. Garnet's tram was late, and by the time she reached Abbey Close the clock pointed to the half-hour. 'I'm frightfully sorry! You must think me a Juggins, but it wasn't my fault!' she apologized. 'We shall have to sprint, but we'll just do it.' The girls set off at a tremendous pace along the Close and down the Abbey avenue, but it was difficult to keep the same speed through the town, where the streets were thronged with country people who had come in for the Saturday market. They got along as best they could, walking first on the pavement and then on the road, dodging round stout females bearing baskets, avoiding hooting motors, and finally making a dash down a back street that led to the railway bridge. They clattered down the steps to the booking office, secured their tickets and rushed on to the platform. The hands of the big clock were at 12.45 exactly, the guard was about to wave his green flag. They were too late to look for their party; they simply pelted towards the nearest carriage, a porter opened the door and they scrambled in just in the very nick of time. 'Oh, thank goodness! Thank goodness!' gasped Garnet. 'I thought we'd miss it! I never had such a run in my life before! Oh! It's given me a stitch in my side!' 'They've put us in a first!' exulted Winona, breathlessly. 'We have it all to ourselves! What luck! Hope they won't make a fuss about our tickets when we get out!' 'It was the porter's fault. He opened the door. We'll ask Miss Lever to explain. I suppose the others are further along somewhere in the train. I wonder if they saw us get in?' 'If they didn't, it will be a surprise packet for them when we turn up.' 'Yes, they'll have made up their minds we're left behind.' The two girls leaned back, enjoying the luxury of traveling in a first-class compartment. They felt the excursion had begun well as far as they were concerned. Their satisfaction was short-lived, however. When they neared Barnhill, the train, instead of stopping, rushed through the station at thirty-five miles an hour. Garnet turned to Winona in utter consternation. 'Oh, good-night!' she ejaculated. 'I verily believe we've gone and got into the express!' They saw at once how it had happened. The 12.40 fast train to Rockfield must have been five minutes late. In their hurry they had mistaken it for the stopping train, which probably had been drawn up behind it in the station. 'Well, this is a pretty go!' agreed Winona. 'We shall be carried on to Rockfield and have to come back.' 'We shall miss the ramble! Oh, it's the limit of hard luck, to see ourselves whizzing through Powerscroft!' 'I say, I believe we're stopping after all!' They let down the window and looked out. They were still about a mile from Powerscroft, but the train drew up, probably in obedience to an adverse signal. Then the girls did a terrible and awful thing. They never remembered afterwards which suggested it, probably the idea occurred to both simultaneously, but in defiance of the law of the realm and the rules of the railway company, they opened the door of the carriage and climbed down on to the line. There were some railings near, and they scrambled over these and dodged down an embankment into a coppice before anybody in the train had time to give an alarm. They hoped their flight had not been noticed, but of that they could not be sure. They hid behind some bushes until they heard the train rumble away. 'That was the smartest thing we've ever done in our lives!' chuckled Garnet. 'I believe we could be fined about ten pounds each if they caught us!' 'Let us hurry on and try to find the road,' said Winona, who was rather frightened at her own temerity, and had a nervous apprehension lest a guard or a signalman or some other railway official might even now be in pursuit and arrest them on a charge of breaking the law. After crossing a field they struck a path which led them eventually into a by-lane. 'I know where we are,' affirmed Garnet. 'I bicycled this way once. Monkend Woods are in that direction, and if we turn to the left and through this village we shall get there sooner than the others, I believe, and be waiting for them when they arrive. Their train won't have reached Powerscroft yet.' 'We'd better step out all the same,' urged Winona. Fortunately Garnet possessed the bump of locality. Her recollection of the district was correct, and after a brisk walk of about a mile they found themselves in the high road close to the wood, and sat down on a wall to wait. Their fast train and short cut had given them an advantage: it was nearly half an hour before they spied the rest of the party strolling leisurely up the hill with baskets and vasculums. The surprise of the League at seeing them was immense, and naturally there were many inquiries as to how they had thus stolen a march upon their friends. 'Oh, we came in an aëroplane!' said Garnet jauntily. 'It just dropped us in the field over there. Very pleasant run, though a little chilly in the clouds!' She was obliged to own up, however, in answer to Miss Lever's inquiries, give a precise account of their adventure, and cry 'peccavi.' 'Of course Dollikins had to be orthodox and preach a short sermon,' she confided afterwards to Winona, 'but I'm sure she'd have done the same thing herself in the circumstances. I could see admiration in her eye, although she talked about running risks and the possibility of broken necks.' Miss Lever, otherwise Dollikins, from the fact that her Christian name was Dorothy, held high favor among the girls. She was brisk and jolly, decidedly athletic, and a first-rate leader of outdoor expeditions. She had called at the gamekeeper's cottage  en route  and shown the letter of permission from the owner of the property, so that the party was able to explore the wood with a clear conscience, despite the trespass notice nailed on to the gate. And what a delightful wood it was! To enter it was like stepping into one of Grimm's fairy tales. An avenue of splendid pines reared their dark boughs against a russet background of beeches; everywhere the leaves seemed to have donned their brightest and gayest tints, as if bidding a last good-by before they fell from the trees. The undergrowth was gorgeous: bramble, elder, honeysuckle, briony, rowan, and alder vied with one another in the vividness of their crimson and orange, while the bracken was a sea of pale gold. There were all sorts of delightful things to be found, acorns lay so plentifully in the pathway that the girls could not help scrunching them underfoot. A few were already sending out tiny shoots in anticipation of spring, and these were carefully saved to take home and grow in bottles. A stream ran through the wood, its banks almost completely covered with vivid green mosses, in sheets so thick and compact that a slight pull would raise a yard at a time. Some resembled tufted tassels, some the most delicate ferns, and others showed the split cups of their seed-vessels like pixie goblets. Annie Hardy, whose experienced eyes were on the look-out for certain botanical treasures reported to grow at Monkend, was searching among the dead twigs under the hazel bushes, and was rewarded by finding a clump of the curious little birds-nest fungus with its seeds packed like tiny eggs inside. Some orange elf-cups, a bright red toadstool or two, and a few of the larger purple varieties that had lingered on from October made quite a creditable fungus record for the League, and specimens of wild flowers were also secured, a belated foxglove or two, a clump of ragwort, some blue harebells, campion, herb-robert, buttercup, yarrow, thistle, and actually a strawberry blossom. The leaders had brought note-books and wrote down each find as reported by the members, taking the specimens for Miss Lever to verify if there were any doubt as to identification. Animal and bird life was not absent. Shy bunnies whisked away, showing a dab of white tail as they dived under the bracken; a splendid squirrel ran across the path and darted up an oak tree, a wood-pigeon whirred from a pine top, a great woodpecker, scared by their approach, started from the bushes and flew past them so near that they could see the green flash of its wings and the red markings on its head, while a whole fluttering flight of long-tailed tits were flitting like a troop of fairies round the hole of a lichen-covered beech. Miss Lever was as enthusiastic as the girls; she climbed over fallen tree trunks, grubbed among dead leaves, jumped the brook and scaled fences with delightful energy. It was she who pointed out the heron sailing overhead, and noticed the gold-crested wren's nest hanging under the branch of a fir, a little battered with autumn rain, and too high, alas! to be taken, but a most interesting item to go down in the note-books. The girls could hardly be persuaded to tear themselves away from the glory of the woods, and would have spent the whole time there, but Miss Lever had other plans. 'Come along! We've scared the pheasants quite enough,' she declared. 'My mind is set on fossils, and if we don't go on to Copplestones at once we shall be caught in the dark, or miss our tea or our train or something equally disagreeable.' The quarry was only half a mile away, and it proved as interesting as the wood. Being Saturday afternoon the men were not working, so they had the place to themselves, and wandered about examining heaps of shale, and tapping likely-looking stones with their hammers. Garnet and Winona knew nothing of geology, so they listened with due meekness while the instructed few discoursed learnedly on palæozoic rocks, stratified conglomerates and quartzites. They rejoiced with Miss Lever, however, when she secured a fairly intact belemnite. It was the only good find they had, though some of the girls got broken bits of fossil shells. 'The fact is one needs a whole day to hunt about in this quarry, and my watch tells me we ought to be going,' said Miss Lever. 'Who feels inclined for tea?' Everybody felt very much disposed, so the procession started off cheerfully for the farm close by, and the nature-lovers were soon hard at work consuming platefuls of bread and butter, jars of jam, and piles of plum cake. 'Sixteen varieties of wild flowers, seven various specimens of fungi, nine different sorts of berries, twelve species of birds noticed, also rabbits and squirrel, one bird's nest and one perfect fossil, not a bad record for an autumn foray!' said Linda, proudly consulting her note-book. 'Especially when you remember we're well on in November!' added Annie. 'It will be something to enter in the League minutes book.' 'I'm afraid it's the last ramble we shall get this year,' said Miss Lever, 'but I've one or two nice little schemes on hand for the spring, so the League must look forward to next April. Will any one have any more tea? Then please make a move, for it's time we were starting.' 'Good old Dollikins!' murmured Linda as the girls put on their coats. 'She's A1 at a foray. Got something ripping for next season in her head. I can tell by the twinkle in her eye. She'll ruminate over it all winter, and drop it on us as a surprise some day. Oh, thunder! Yes, we ought to be starting! Come along, you slackers, do you want to be left standing on the platform with a couple of hours to wait for the next train? Then sprint as hard as you can!' CHAPTER VIII Concerns a Camera Winona went home at Christmas with a whole world of new experiences to call her own. Her first term had indeed been an epoch in her life, and though the holidays were naturally welcome, she felt that she could look forward with pleasure to the next session of school. Her family received her with a certain amount of respect. The younger ones listened enviously to her accounts of hockey matches and symposiums, and began to wish Fate had wafted their fortunes to Seaton. They had left Miss Harmon's little school, and next term were expecting, with some apprehension, a governess whom Aunt Harriet had recommended. Winona, who after thirteen weeks at Abbey Close found the home arrangements rather chaotic, could not help privately endorsing Miss Beach's wisdom in instituting such a change. Poor Mrs. Woodward had been greatly out of health for the last few months, and kept much to her bedroom, while the children had been running wild in a quite deplorable fashion. Letty, who ought to have had some influence over the others, was the naughtiest of all, and the ringleader in every mischievous undertaking. Having occupied the position of 'eldest' for thirteen weeks, she was not at all disposed to submit to her sister's authority, and there were many tussles between the two. 'You'll  have  to do as your governess tells you, when she comes!' protested Winona on one particularly urgent occasion. 'All right, Grannie!' retorted Letty pertly. 'I'll settle that matter with the good lady herself, and in the meantime I'm not going to knuckle under to you, so don't think it! You needn't come back so precious high and mighty from your High School, and expect to boss the whole show here. So there!' And Winona, who aforetime had been able to subdue her unruly sister, found herself baffled, for their mother was ill, and must not be disturbed, and Percy, who might have been on her side, would only lie on the sofa and guffaw. 'Fight it out, like a pair of Kilkenny cats!' was his advice. 'I'll sweep up the fragments that remain of you afterwards. No, I'm not going to back either of you. Go ahead and get it over!' Percy had grown immensely during this last term. He was now seventeen, and very tall, though at present decidedly lanky. The Cadet Corps at his school absorbed most of his interests. He held emphatic opinions upon the war, and aired them daily to his family over the morning paper. According to his accounts, matters seemed likely to make little progress until he and his contemporaries at Longworth College should have reached military age, and be able to take their due part in the struggle, at which happy crisis the Germans would receive a setback that would astonish the Kaiser. 'Our British tactics have been all wrong!' he declared. 'I can tell you we follow things out inch by inch at Longworth, and you should just hear what Johnstone Major has to say. Some of those generals at the Front are old women! They ought to send them home, and set them some knitting to do. If I'd the ordering of affairs I'd give the command to fellows under twenty-five! New wine should be in new bottles.' The younger children listened with admiration to Percy's views on war topics, much regretting that the Government had not yet obtained the benefit of his advice. Godfrey even hoped that the war would not be over before there was a chance for precept to be put into practice, and already, in imagination, saw his brother in the uniform of a Field Marshal. Winona smiled tolerantly. She took Percy's opinions for what they were worth. If his school report was anything to go by, he had certainly not won laurels at Longworth this term, in the direction of brainwork, and the headmaster's comment: 'Lacking in steady application,' had probably been amply justified. Winona was not altogether happy about Percy, these holidays. Jack Cassidy was spending Christmas at the Vicarage, and claimed much of his time, and the influence was not altogether for good. Young Cassidy had already given the Vicar, his guardian and former tutor, considerable trouble. At twenty-two he had run through a large proportion of the money which had come to him at his majority, though fortunately he could not touch the bulk of his property till he should be twenty-five. At present he was waiting for a commission, and amusing himself as best he could in the village until the welcome missive should arrive. For lack of other congenial companions he sought Percy's society. Neither Mr. James, the Vicar, nor Mrs. Woodward realized how much the two young fellows were together, or they certainly would not have encouraged the intimacy. Winona, who was just old enough to recognize certain undesirable features, tackled Percy in private. 'Mother wouldn't like your going into 'The Blue Harp,' and playing billiards with Jack!' she remonstrated. 'You were there hours yesterday. Doesn't it cost a lot?' 'Oh, Jack pays for it! At least he settles with old Chubbs. I have a bit on the score, of course, but he says that can wait a while. I'm improving, and I'll beat him yet, and win my own back.' 'You promised mother you wouldn't bet again, after what happened last Easter.' 'Now don't you go jaw-wagging!' 'Well, I must say something! If Mr. Joynson, ' 'Old Joynson may go and boil his head! I'm seventeen now. Look here, Win, if you're going to turn sneak, ' 'Sneak, indeed! Do I ever tell your secrets? Think what you did at Aunt Harriet's!' Percy changed color. 'You've not breathed a word about that?' 'Of course I haven't, but I'm always terrified that she'll find out.' 'It was a rocky little business. I say, Win, I was looking up wills in 'Every Man his Own Lawyer.' If Aunt Harriet died intestate all her estate would go to her next-of-kin, and that's Uncle Herbert Beach out in China. The mater wouldn't have a look-in, because her mother was only Aunt Harriet's half-sister. Uncle Herbert would just get the lot. She ought to make another will at once.' 'Had you better tell, then?' faltered Winona. 'Tell? Certainly not! But you might very well suggest it to her. You've plenty of opportunities, as you're living there. Bring the conversation round to wills, and ask casually if she's made hers.' 'Oh, I couldn't!' 'Yes, you could. You ought to do it, Winona. The mater stands to lose everything as it is. It would probably make Aunt Harriet look inside the drawer, and then she'd see her paper was gone.' 'And suspect us!' 'Why should she know we'd had anything to do with it? The servants might have been rummaging. I certainly think it's your duty, Win, to take some steps.' It was rather fine to hear Percy preaching duty on a subject in which he was so plainly a defaulter. Winona at first indignantly repudiated the task he wished to impose upon her. Nevertheless, the idea kept returning and troubling her. She was sure Aunt Harriet ought to know that the will had been destroyed, and if it was impossible to tell her outright, this would certainly be a means of putting her on the track. Winona's whole soul revolted from the notion of speculating upon possible advantages to be gained from a relative's death. She would rather let Uncle Herbert inherit everything than interfere for herself. But for her mother it was a different matter. Aunt Harriet might wish her goddaughter to receive part of her fortune, and to conceal the destruction of the will might mean depriving Mrs. Woodward of a handsome legacy. How to make Miss Beach realize the loss of the paper without getting Percy into trouble was a problem that might have perplexed older and wiser heads. Meanwhile it was holiday time, and there were many more pleasant subjects to think about. Winona's Christmas present had been a small hand camera, the very thing for which she had longed during the whole of the past term. She contemplated it with the utmost satisfaction. Now she would be able to join the Photographic Club at school, to go out on some of the Saturday afternoon expeditions, and to have a few of her prints in the Exhibition. She could take snap-shots of the girls and the classroom, and make them into picture postcards to send to her mother, and she could make a series of home photos to hang up in her bedroom at Abbey Close. There seemed no limit indeed to the possibilities of her new camera. She guarded it jealously from the prying fingers of the younger members of the family. 'Paws off!' she commanded. 'Anybody who interferes with this Kodak will quarrel with me, so I give you full and fair warning! Oh, yes, Dorrie! I dare say you'd just like to press the button! I'd guarantee your fairy fingers to smash anything! It's 'mustn't touch, only look' where this is concerned. No personal familiarities, please!' December and January were scarcely propitious months for the taking of snap-shots, but Winona attempted some time exposures, with varying results. It was difficult to make the children realize the necessity of keeping absolutely still, and they spoilt several of her plates by grinning or moving. She secured quite a nice photo of the house, however, and several of the village, and promised herself better luck with family portraits when the summer came round again. She turned a large cupboard in the attic into her dark-room, and spent many hours dabbling among chemicals. She had urgent offers of help, but rejected them steadfastly, greatly to the disappointment of her would-be assistants. Her sanctum became a veritable Bluebeard's chamber, for to prevent possible accidents she locked the door, and kept the key perpetually in her pocket during the day time, sleeping with it under her pillow at night. In the summer she meant to try all kinds of experiments. She had visions of rigging up a shelter made of leaves and branches, and taking a series of magnificent snap-shots of wild birds and animals, like those in the books by Cherry Kearton, and she certainly intended to secure records of the sports at school. In the meantime she must content herself with landscape and still life. 'I'll have one of the de Claremont tomb, at any rate,' she resolved. The de Claremont tomb was the glory of Ashbourne Church. It was of white marble, and beautifully sculptured. Sir Guy de Claremont lay represented in full armor, with his lady in ruff and coif by his side. Six sons and four daughters, all kneeling, were carved in has relief round the side of the monument. Long, long ago, in the Middle Ages, the de Claremonts had been the great people of the neighborhood. They had fought in the Crusades, had taken their part in the wars of the Barons, had declared for the White Rose in the struggle with the House of Lancaster, and cast in their lot for the King against Oliver Cromwell. The family was extinct now, and their lands had passed to others, but a few tattered banners and an old helmet still hung on the wall of the side chapel, above the tomb, testifying to their former achievements. From her seat in church Winona had a good view of the monument. She admired it immensely, and had often woven romances about the good knights of old who had carried those banners to the battle-field. She felt that she would like to secure a satisfactory photo. She started off one morning at about half-past eleven, when the light was likely to be best. It was a sunny day, and wonderfully bright for January. She had meant to go alone, but the children were on the look-out, and tracked her, so she arrived at the church door closely followed by Letty, Mamie, Godfrey, Ernie and Dorrie. She hesitated for a moment whether to send them straight home or not, but the church was a mile from Highfield, and the mill weir, a place of fascination to Ernie, lay on the way, so she decided that it would be safest to let well alone. 'They're imps, but they'll have to behave themselves decently in church,' she said to herself. At present the conduct of the family was exemplary. They walked in on tip-toe, and talked in whispers. Mamie, indeed, cast an envious eye towards the forbidden ground of the pulpit, into which it was her ambition some day to climb, and wave her arms about in imitation of the Vicar, but she valiantly restrained her longings, and kept from the neighborhood of the chancel. Letty took a surreptitious peep at the organ, and was disappointed to find it locked, as was also the little oak door that led up the winding staircase to the bell tower. She decided that the parish clerk was much too attentive to his duties. 'Come along over here, can't you?' said Winona suspiciously. 'Leave those hymn-books alone, and tell Dorrie she's not to touch the font, or I'll stick her inside and pop the lid on her. Go and sit down, all of you, in that pew, while I take the photo.' The family for once complied obediently, if somewhat reluctantly. It was better to play the part of spectators than to be left out of the proceedings altogether. In the circumstances they knew Winona had the whip-hand, and that if she ordered them from the church there would be no appeal. They watched her now with interest and enthusiasm. It took her a long time to fix her camera in good position. It was difficult to see properly in the viewfinder, and she wanted to be quite sure that when the head of Sir Guy was safely in the right-hand corner, his feet were not out of the picture at the left, to say nothing of the ten kneeling children underneath. 'It's impossible to get the wall above if I'm to take the inscription on the monument,' she declared, 'and yet I mustn't leave out the old helmet on any account. I shall take it down, and put it at the bottom of the tomb while I photograph it. It ought to come out rather well there.' Rejecting eager offers of help from Mamie and Ernie, Winona climbed up on to the stately person of Dame Margaret de Claremont, and managed to take the helmet from the wooden peg on which it was suspended. She posed it at the foot of the monument, on the right hand side. 'There's a splendid light from this window, full sunshine! I think if I give it five minutes' exposure, that ought to do the deed. Now don't any of you so much as cough, or you'll disturb the air.' The family felt  that  five minutes the very limit of endurance. The moment it was ended they dispersed to ease their strained feelings. Letty and Ernie walked briskly up the nave. Mamie went to investigate the stove. Winona herself took the camera to the opposite side of the church to photograph a Jacobean tablet. Six-year-old Dorrie remained sitting on a hassock in the pew. She had a plan in her crafty young mind. She wanted to examine the helmet, and she knew Winona would be sure to say 'Paws off!' or something equally offensive and objectionable. She waited till her sister was safely out of the way, then she stole from her cover, grabbed the helmet, and returned to the shelter of the pew. It made quite an interesting and fascinating plaything in her estimation. She amused herself with it for a long time, until she heard Winona's voice proclaiming that if they didn't trot home quickly they'd be late for dinner, whereupon she popped it under the seat, and joined the others. Winona, of course, ought to have replaced it on its peg on the wall, but her memory was far from perfect, and she completely forgot all about it. The whole thing seemed a most trivial incident, but it had an amazing sequel. On Saturday afternoons Mrs. Fisher, the caretaker, always came to sweep and tidy up the church in preparation for Sunday. She was a little, thin, sharp-nosed, impulsive woman, and just at present her nerves were rather in a shaky condition for fear of Zeppelins. She lived in perpetual terror of bombs or German spies, and always slept with half her clothing on, in case she should be forced to get up in a hurry and flee for her life. On this particular Saturday afternoon Mrs. Fisher, as was her wont, washed the pavement of the nave, and then took her broom and her duster into the side chapel. Nobody sat there as a rule, so she did not give it very much attention. She flicked the duster over the monument, hastily swept the floor in front, and was just about to turn away, having done her duty, when she caught sight of something under the seat of a pew. She put her hand to her heart, and turned as white as her own best linen apron. She divined instantly what it must be. With great presence of mind she stole softly away on tip-toe. Once outside the church she indulged in a comfortable little burst of hysterics. Then she felt better, and went to tell the parish clerk. Before evening the news had spread all over the village. 'It was brought in a motor car,' Mrs. Pikes at the shop informed her customers, 'and Wilson's little boy says he heard them talking German.' 'There was a foreign-looking sort of a chap rode past our house on a bicycle the other day,' volunteered the blacksmith's assistant. 'You never know where you are with strangers in war time,' said another. Everybody agreed that it was a mercy Mrs. Fisher had seen it when she did, and they were glad the church was a goodish way from the village. The Woodward family generally started off for service almost directly after the bells began to ring. On the following Sunday morning, however, they were considerably perplexed. The familiar 'ding-dong, ding-dong' which ought to have been pealing forth was not to be heard. They listened in vain, and consulted all the clocks in the house. 'It's certainly after ten,' said Mrs. Woodward. 'I'm afraid something must have happened! I hope Mr. James isn't ill. Well, we'd better go at any rate, and see what's the matter.' So the family, which was ready in its best Sunday garments, sallied forth. Ashbourne Church stood a whole mile away from the village, in a lonely spot with only a couple of cottages near it. The Woodwards took a short cut across the common from Highfield, so that they did not pass any houses or meet any neighbors by the way. They arrived at the church to find the door locked, and the Vicar and his family standing in consternation outside. Mr. James hailed them with relief. 'So it  is  Sunday!' he exclaimed. 'I began to think we must have mistaken the day! I can't understand what's the matter. Nobody's here except ourselves. What's becomes of Stevens?' It was certainly an unprecedented circumstance to find choir, congregation, organist, organ-blower, bell-ringer and verger all conspicuous by their absence. Mr. James went to the cottages near to make inquiries as to the cause. The first was locked up, but by knocking long and loudly at the door of the second, he at last succeeded in rousing Jacob Johnson, a deaf old man of eighty-three. 'Nobody come to church!' he repeated, when after some difficulty and much shouting the situation had been explained: 'Well, 'tain't likely there should be! I'm told there's a German bomb there, one of the dangerous sort for going off. Some men brought it yesterday in a motor car. Spies of the Kaiser, they were. It may explode any minute, they say, and wreck the church and everything near. The Greenwoods next door locked up the house, and went to their aunt's in the village. My daughter came over here asking me to go home with her, but I said I'd stay and risk it. At eighty-three one doesn't care to move!' 'Where is this bomb?' asked Mr. James. 'In a pew nigh the old monument, so I'm told.' At this juncture Jack Cassidy, who when the church was first found to be locked had volunteered to run back to the Vicarage and fetch the Vicar's own key, now arrived after a record sprint. 'Give me a bucket of water, and I'll go and investigate,' said Mr. James. He came out of the church in the course of a few minutes, holding in his hand, the old helmet! 'This is the nearest approach to a bomb of any description that I've been able to discover,' he announced. 'I'm going to carry it to the village to convince the wiseacres there. Perhaps Stevens will pluck up courage to ring the bell for afternoon service. If not, I'll ring it myself.' Winona's share in the business might have remained concealed but for the indiscretion of Mamie, who by an incautious remark gave the show away entirely. 'You little silly!' scolded Winona afterwards. 'What possessed you to go and say anything at all? Mr. James will never forgive me! I could see it in his eye. And Mrs. James was ice itself! I've never felt so horrible in all my life. If you'd only had the sense to keep mum, they might never have found out. You kids are the most frightful nuisance! If I'd had my choice given me when I was born, I wouldn't have been an eldest sister.' CHAPTER IX The School Service Badge Settling down at Abbey Close after a month at Highfield was like transferring oneself from a noisy farmyard to the calm of the cloister. The house was so near to the Minster that it seemed pervaded by the quiet Cathedral atmosphere. When Winona drew up her blinds in the morning, the first sight that greeted her would be the grey old towers and carved pinnacles, exactly opposite, where the jackdaws were chattering, and the pigeons wheeling round, and the big clock was going through the chimes and striking the hour of seven. There was a particular gargoyle at the corner of the transept roof which appeared to be grinning at her across the road, as if some imp were imprisoned in the stone image, and were peeping out of its fantastic eyes. Winona had grown to love the Minster. She would go in whenever she had ten minutes to spare after school. The glorious arches and pillars, the carved choir stalls, the light falling through the splendid rich windows on to the marble pavement, all appealed to the artistic sense that was stirring in her, and gave her immense satisfaction. But even the beauty of the Cathedral was as nothing when the organ began to play. Mr. Holmes, the organist, was a great musician, and could manage his instrument with a wizard touch. In the afternoons, between four and five o'clock, he was wont to practice his voluntaries, and to listen to these took Winona into a new world of sound. He was a disciple of the extreme modern school of music, and his interpretations of Debussy, César Franck, Medtner and Glazounow came to her as a revelation. The glorious weird harmonies, the strange, unaccustomed chords of these tone-poems stirred her like the memory of something long forgotten. As Anglo-Indians, whose knowledge of Hindustani faded with their childhood, yet start and thrill at the sound of the once familiar language, so this dream-music brought haunting elusive suggestions too subtle to be defined. It held a distinct part in Winona's development. The girl was growing up suddenly. In the almost nursery atmosphere of Highfield, with nothing to stimulate her faculties she had remained at a very childish stage, but now, with a world of art, music, science and literature dawning round her she seemed to leap upward to the level of her new intellectual horizon. It is a glorious time when we first begin to reap the inheritance of the ages, and to discover the rich stores of delight that master minds have laid up for us to enjoy. Life was moving very fast to Winona; she could not analyze all her fresh thoughts and impressions, but she felt she could no more go back to her last year's mental outlook than she could have worn the long clothes of her babyhood. She was sixteen now, for her birthday fell on the 20th of January. Somehow sixteen sounded so infinitely older than fifteen! There was a dignity about it and a sense of importance. In another year she would actually be 'sweet seventeen,' and a member of that enviable school hierarchy the Sixth Form! Winona could have made herself thoroughly happy at Abbey Close but for the shadow that existed between herself and Aunt Harriet. Percy's secret was a perpetual burden on her conscience. At meal times she would often find her eyes wandering towards the oak cupboard, and would start guiltily, hoping Miss Beach had not noticed. The more she thought about the subject the more convinced she became that she ought to give some hint of the state of affairs, though how to do so without implicating her brother was at present beyond her calculations. One day, however, a really hopeful opportunity seemed to arise. A case of a disputed will was being tried at the Seaton Sessions; the defendants were friends of Miss Beach's, and after reading the account of the proceedings, Aunt Harriet laid down the local paper with a few comments. 'I suppose people ought to make their wills very fast and firm,' said Winona. It was seldom she ventured on an independent remark. As a rule she left her aunt to do the talking. 'Undoubtedly. Nothing causes more trouble than carelessness in this respect.' 'Ought we all to make wills?' 'If we have anything to leave it's advisable.' 'Ought I?' 'Well, hardly at present, I should say!' 'Ought mother?' Winona was growing redder and redder. 'No doubt she has done so.' 'Have you made yours, Aunt Harriet?' The horrible deed was done, and Winona, crimson to the roots of her hair, felt she had, metaphorically speaking, burnt her boats. Miss Beach stared at her as if electrified. 'What do you want to know for?' she asked, suspiciously. 'I think that's decidedly my business and not yours!' Winona collapsed utterly, and murmuring something about preparation, fled to her bedroom. 'There! I've just gone and put my foot in it altogether!' she groaned. 'I've no tact! I went and blurted it out like an idiot. She'll never forgive me! Oh, why can't I go and tell her the whole business, and then she'd understand! I do hate this sneaking work. Percy, you wretched boy, I'd like to bump your head against the wall! It's too bad to land me in your scrape! Well, I suppose it can't be helped. I've said it, and it's done. But I know I'll be in disgrace for evermore.' Certainly Aunt Harriet's manner towards Winona, after this unfortunate episode, was stiffer than formerly. She was perfectly kind, but the gulf between them had widened. They still discussed conventional topics at meal-times, or rather Miss Beach made leading remarks and Winona said 'Yes,' or 'No,' for such a one-sided conversation could hardly be termed discussion. The girl felt it a relief when, as often happened, her aunt took refugein a book. Occasionally Winona would pluck up courage to relate news from her home letters, but of her school life and all her new impressions and interests she scarcely spoke at all. Judging from the children's correspondence the new governess at Highfield, after a stormy beginning, was making some impressions upon her wild little pupils. 'I hated her at first,' wrote Mamie, 'but she tells us the most lovely fairy tales, and we're learning to model in clay. I like it because it makes such a mess. Ernie smacked her yesterday, and she wouldn't let him do his painting till he'd said he was sorry.' Winona laughed over the letters, picturing the lively scenes that must be taking place at home. 'Do the kids a world of good!' she commented. 'They were running to seed. Even I could see that, as long ago as last summer, and I don't mind confessing, quite to myself, that I was fairly raw then. I didn't know very much about anything till I came to the 'Seaton High.'' Winona's second term was running far more smoothly than her first. Thanks to Miss Lever's coaching she could now hold her own in her Form, and though she might not be the most shining light, at any rate she was not numbered among the slackers. Her progress was marked in more quarters than she suspected. Margaret Howell had had the Scholarship winners under observation ever since their arrival. As head girl she made it her business to know something about every girl in the school. 'The General,' as she was nicknamed, was universally voted a success. She and Kirsty Paterson between them had organized a new era of things. Every one felt the 'Seaton High' was waking up and beginning to found a reputation for itself. The various guilds and societies were prospering, and following Margaret's pet motto 'Pro Bono Publico,' had exterminated private quarrels and instituted the most business-like proceedings and the strictest civility at committee meetings. Already the general tone was raised immeasurably, and public spirit and school patriotism ran high. To encourage zeal and strenuousness, Margaret and Kirsty had laid their heads together and decided to found what they called 'The Order of Distinguished School Service.' Any girl who was considered to have performed some action worthy of special commendation or who had otherwise contributed to the general benefit, was to be rewarded with a badge, and her name was to be chronicled in a book kept for the purpose. The very first to gain the honor was little Daisy Hicks, a Second Form child, who won 9,400 marks out of a possible 10,000 in the Christmas exams, so far the highest score known in the school. Agnes Heath, who wrung special praise from the doctor who conducted the Ambulance examination, and Gladys Vickcrs, whose photograph of the hockey team was published in the Seaton  Weekly Graphic , were also placed upon the distinguished list, having substantially helped the credit of the school. The badge was only a rosette made of narrow ribbons, stitched in tiny loops into the form of a daisy, with a yellow disk, and white and pink outer rays. If meant very much, however, to the recipient, who knew that her name would be handed down to posterity in the school traditions, and every girl was immensely keen to earn it. A new institution in the school this term was the foundation of a library. It had been a pet project of Margaret's ever since her appointment as head prefect. Just before the Christmas breaking up she had called a general meeting and begged everybody after the holidays to present at least one contribution. 'It may be a new book or an old one,' she had explained, 'but it must be really interesting. Please don't bring rubbish. Give something you would enjoy reading yourself and can recommend to your friends.' The response to her appeal had been greater than she anticipated. Nobody failed to comply, and some of the girls brought several books apiece. A start was made with three hundred and forty-one volumes, which was regarded as a most creditable beginning. For the present they were piled up in the prefects' room until shelves had been made to receive them. Miss Bishop had given the order to the joiner, but owing to the war it might be some time before the work was finished. Meanwhile Margaret decided that the books ought to be catalogued and labeled, so that they would be quite ready when the bookcases arrived. She cast about for helpers in this rather arduous task, and her choice fell upon Winona, who happened to have a spare half-hour between her classes on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. Winona, immensely flattered, accepted the responsibility with glee, and was put to work under the 'General's' directions. She thoroughly enjoyed sorting, dusting, pasting on labels, and making alphabetical lists. 'I shouldn't mind being a librarian some day in a big public library,' she assured Ellinor Cooper, her fellow-assistant. 'You'd have to be quicker than you are at present, then,' remarked Margaret dryly. 'They wouldn't think you worth your salt if you spent all your time reading the books. Buck up, can't you? and get on!' At which Winona guiltily shut 'Shirley' with a bang and turned her attention to the paste-pot. While Margaret was cultivating the intellectual side of the school, Kirsty was carefully attending to her duties as Games Captain. Her work among the juniors prospered exceedingly. They were taking to hockey with wild enthusiasm and gave evidence of considerable promise. As most of them were free at three o'clock, they got the chance of playing almost every day. Kirsty was extremely anxious that these practices should be properly supervised. She was too busy herself to take them personally, so she was obliged to delegate the work to anybody who had the spare time. 'The girls I want most are all at classes or music lessons,' she lamented. 'Not a single one of the team's available. Winona Woodward, I've been looking at your time-table, and find you've two vacant half-hours. Wouldn't you like to help?' 'Like! I'd sell my birthright to do it!' gasped Winona. 'But I'm fearfully sorry; I'm cataloguing for Margaret!' 'Then I mustn't take you away from the General! It's a nuisance though, for you'd have done very well, and I don't know who else I can get.' Winona considered it was one of the sharpest disappointments she had ever gone through. 'Oh, the grizzly bad luck of it!' she wailed to Garnet. 'It would have been idyllic to coach those kids. And it would have given me such a leg up with Kirsty! To think I've lost my chance!' 'I suppose Margaret might get some one else to do cataloguing?' 'I dare say: but I couldn't possibly ask her, and I'm sure Kirsty won't. No, I'm done for!' School etiquette is very strict, and Winona would have perished sooner than resign her library duties. She felt a martyr, but resolved to smile through it all. Garnet contemplated the problem at leisure during her drawing lesson, and arrived at a daring conclusion. Without consulting her friend she marched off at four o'clock to the prefects' room, a little sanctum on the ground floor where the minutes' books of the various guilds and societies were kept, and where the school officers could hold meetings and transact business. As she expected, Margaret was there alone, and said 'Come in' in answer to her rap at the door. The members of the Sixth kept much on their dignity, so it was rather a formidable undertaking even for a Fifth Form girl to interrupt the head of the school. Margaret looked up inquiringly as Garnet entered. 'Yes, I'm fearfully busy,' she replied to the murmured question. 'What is it? I can give you five minutes, but no more, so please be brief.' Thus urged, Garnet, though greatly embarrassed, did not beat about the bush. 'I've come to ask a frightfully cheeky thing,' she blurted out. 'Kirsty wants Winona to coach the kids at hockey, and Winona's cataloguing for you, so of course she can't, and, ' but here Garnet's courage failed her, so she paused. 'Do you mean that Winona would prefer to help with the juniors?' 'She'd be torn in pieces rather than let me say so, but she's just crazy over hockey. I hope I haven't made any mischief! Win doesn't know I've come.' 'All right. I understand. I'll see what can be done in the matter,' returned the General, opening her books as a sign of dismissal. Garnet was not at all sure whether her mission had succeeded or the reverse, but the next day Margaret sent for Winona. 'I hear Kirsty wants you for a hockey coach. Just at present I think games are of more importance in the school than the library, so please report yourself to her, and say I've taken your name off my list. You've done very well here, but I'm going to lend you to Kirsty for a while.' Winona was so astounded she hardly knew whether to stammer out apologies, gratitude, or regrets, and was intensely relieved when the head girl cut her short kindly but firmly, and sent her away. She lost no time in seeking out the Games Captain. 'Very decent of Margaret,' remarked Kirsty. 'It's got me out of a hole, for I couldn't find anybody else with that special time free. You'll do your best I know?' ' Rather !' beamed Winona ecstatically. Under her tuition the children's play improved fast. Kirsty said little, she was not given to over-praising people, but Winona felt she noticed and approved. Among the season's fixtures perhaps the most important was the match with the Seaton Ladies' Hockey Club that was to come off on March 7th. Their opponents possessed a fair reputation in the city, so it would behove the school to 'play up for all they were worth,' as Kirsty expressed it. It would be a glorious opportunity of showing their capabilities to the world at large, and demonstrating that they meant to take their due place in local athletics. Three days before the event, Kirsty appeared in the morning with the air of a tragedy queen. 'What's the matter?' queried Patricia. 'You've a face as long as a fiddle!' 'Matter enough! Barbara Jennings is laid up with influenza! What'll become of the match I don't know. It makes me feel rocky. Where's Margaret? I want to confab. Did you ever hear of such grizzly luck in your life?' At five minutes past eleven, when Winona was eating her lunch in the gymnasium, Kirsty tapped her on the shoulder. 'I've something to tell you, Winona Woodward. You're to play for the School on Saturday instead of Barbara.' Winona swallowed a piece of biscuit with foolhardy haste. She could scarcely believe the news, so great was its magnitude. To be asked to fill a vacant place in the team was beyond her wildest dreams. 'Thanks most  immensely !' she stammered, with her eyes shining like stars. Through the next few days Winona simply lived for Saturday. To be able to represent the School! The glorious thought was never for a moment absent from her mind. She even ventured to tell Aunt Harriet the honor that had been thrust upon her, and was astonished at the interest with which her information was received. On the Saturday afternoon the High School turned up almost in full force to view the match; juniors were keen as seniors, and the children whom Winona had coached were wild with excitement. The field was packed with spectators, for the Ladies' Club had brought many friends. It was even rumored that a reporter from the Seaton  Weekly Graphic  was present. The High School team in navy blue gymnasium costumes, bare heads and close-plaited pigtails, looked neat and trim and very business-like. 'A much fitter set than we showed last year!' murmured Margaret with satisfaction. All eyes were riveted on the field as the two opponents stood out to 'bully' and the sticks first clashed together. Winona, her face aglow with excitement, waited a chance to run. A little later her opportunity came: she dashed into the masses of the opponents' force, and with one magnificent stroke swept the ball well onward towards the goal. 'Oh! how precious!' shouted the girls. Nobody had imagined Winona capable of such a feat. She at once became the focus of all eyes. It had not occurred to the High School that there was a real possibility of their winning the match. They had expected to make a gallant fight and be defeated, retiring with all the honors of war. Perhaps the Ladies' Club team, who had come to the field secure of victory, began to feel pangs of uneasiness under their white jerseys. The situation was supreme. The score had become even. Could the School possibly do it? That was the question. All looked to Winona for the answer. She was playing like one inspired. She had not realized her own capacities before: the wild excitement of the moment seemed to lend wings to her feet and strength and skill to her arm. One heroic, never-to-be-forgotten stroke, and the ball was spinning between the posts. It was a magnificent finish. Frantic applause rose up from the spectators. The High School cheered its champions in a glorious roar of victory. The Ladies' Club team were magnanimous enough to offer congratulations, and their captain shook hands with Winona. 'Glad to see how your standard's gone up!' she remarked to Kirsty aside. 'That half-back of yours is worth her salt!' Kirsty was literally purring with satisfaction. Last year the High School had been badly beaten in more than half its matches. This was indeed a new page in its records. On Monday morning Winona received a message summoning her to the prefects' room. She found Margaret, Kirsty, and the other school officers assembled there. 'Winona Woodward,' said the head girl, 'we have decided to present you with the School Service Badge, in recognition of your play on Saturday. It is felt that you really secured the match, and as this is our first great victory we consider you deserve to have it recorded in your favor. Your name has been entered in the book. Come here!' Winona turned crimson as Margaret pinned the daisy badge on to her blouse. 'I, I've been only too proud to do what I can!' she blurted out. 'Thanks most  awfully !' CHAPTER X A Scare The Spring Term came to a close with a very fair number of hockey successes to be placed to the credit of the Seaton High School. Compared with last year's record it was indeed a great improvement, and Kirsty felt that though they had not yet established a games reputation, they at any rate showed good promise of future achievements. She hoped to do much in the cricket and tennis season, though she certainly acknowledged there was much to be done. The cricket so far had been such a half-hearted business that she doubted the advisability of making any fixtures. 'I believe we'd just better train up for all we're worth,' she said at the committee meeting. 'It'll take ages to lick an eleven into shape. What we want is to get a cricket atmosphere into the school. You can't develop these things all in a few weeks. You've got to catch your kids young and teach them, before you get a school with a reputation. I feel with all the games that we're simply building foundations at present at the Seaton High. This term especially is spade-work. I'll do all I can to get things going, but it will be the Games Captain who comes after me who'll reap the reward.' 'Can't you stay on another year?' suggested Patricia. 'Wish I could for some things, but it's impossible. No, I'll do my bit this term, and then hand over the job to my successor. As I said before, what we want now is a good start.' Kirsty was a capital organizer. She soon recognized a girl's capacities, and she had a knack of inspiring enthusiasm even in apparent slackers. She worked thoroughly hard herself, and insisted that everybody else did the same. Her motto for the term was the athletic education of the rank and file. It was really very self-sacrificing of her, for she might have gained far more credit by concentrating her energies on a few, but for the ultimate good of the school it was undoubtedly far and away the best policy to pursue. The training of a number of recruits may not be as interesting as the polishing up of champions, but in time recruits become veterans, and a school in which the standard of the ordinary play is very high has a better general chance than one that depends on an occasional  solitary  star. So even the little girls were strictly supervised in their practices, and both cricket and tennis showed healthy development. The Governors and the head mistress were anxious that the games department should prosper, and gave every encouragement. There were a larger number of tennis courts provided than fall to the share of most schools, and each form had its allotted times for play. Athletics were indeed compulsory, every girl being required to take her due part, unless she were excused by a medical certificate. Winona worked with the utmost enthusiasm. As a Fifth Form girl she had, of course, to be rather humble towards the Sixth, but she felt that Kirsty approved of her. It was never Kirsty's way to praise, and she could be scathing in her remarks sometimes, but Winona did not mind criticism from her captain, and acted so well on all the advice given that she was making rapid strides. In pursuance of Kirsty's all-round training policy, she was not allowed to specialize in either tennis or cricket this summer, but to give equal energy to both. So she practiced bowling under Hester King's careful supervision, and played exciting sets while Clarice Nixon stood by to watch and score. The games appealed to Winona more than any other part of the school curriculum. She did fairly well now in her Form work, but she knew she could never be clever like Garnet, and that it was extremely unlikely that she would win laurels on her books. She had promised Miss Bishop that she would try to do credit to the school in return for her scholarship, and to help to raise its athletic reputation seemed her most feasible method of success. 'I could never get a College Scholarship, however I tried,' she thought, 'but, I won't say it's probable, but it's just possible that I might do something some day in the way of winning matches. Miss Bishop would be pleased at that!' The early summer was delightful at Seaton. The park opposite the school was full of tulips and hyacinths, and the long avenue of trees in the Abbey Close had burst into tender green foliage. Winona studied her home lessons sitting by her open bedroom window with a leafy bower outside, and an accompaniment of jackdaws cawing in the old towers of the Minster. She loved this window and the prospect from it. There was a romantic, old-world flavor about the gray pile opposite, its carvings and cloisters and chiming bells seemed so peaceful and so far removed from modern trouble. Sometimes indeed the whirr of a biplane would disturb the quiet as an airman flittered like a great dragon-fly over the city, reminding her that medieval times were past; while a bugle call from the neighboring barracks emphasized the fact that the world was at war. Not that Winona was likely to forget that! Every day in school the Peace Bell prayer was read at noon, and she might see regiments of recruits marching up or down the High Street on their way to their training grounds. Nearly every girl in V.a. had some relation at the front, and though Winona could not boast of anybody nearer than a third cousin serving 'somewhere in France,' she looked for news as eagerly as the rest. 'It must be glorious to get letters from the trenches,' she said half wistfully one day to Beatrice Howell, who was exulting over a pencil scrawl written by her brother in a dug-out. 'I half wish, , ' 'No, you don't!' snapped Beatrice. 'It's a nightmare to have them in the firing line! Be thankful your brother's still safe at school.' On the subject of Percy, Winona was far from easy. He had let fall one or two hints during the Easter holidays which confirmed her previous suspicion that he had got into a wrong set at Longworth College. He had written to her twice already this term, wanting to borrow money, and suggesting that, without mentioning his name, she should ask Miss Beach to lend it to her. With such a request, however, Winona had utterly refused to comply. 'Aunt Harriet has been so decent to us I can't begin to sponge on her,' she wrote back. 'Besides, she'd want to know what I wanted such a lot for, and then all the mischief would be out!' Apparently Percy was offended, for his usual weekly letter did not appear. Winona only laughed, expecting he would soon get over his fit of sulks. She was utterly unprepared for the sequel. One day she received a note from him written on Y.M.C.A. paper and headed 'Horminster.' It ran thus: 'DEAR WIN,, I'd got into such an altogether grizzly hole that there was only one way out, and I've taken it. I am at present a member of His Majesty's Forces, and if you want to write to me address: Private P. D. Woodward, 17th Battalion, Royal Rytonshire Fusiliers, Horminster.                                    'Your affectionate brother,                                                       'PERCY.'   'P.S., You can tell the mater if you like.' Winona, in a great state of excitement, showed the note to Aunt Harriet, who telegraphed the information to Mrs. Woodward. The latter had just heard from Percy's housemaster of his disappearance, and was greatly relieved to have news of his whereabouts. The runaway was below military age, and his mother's first impulse was to apply for his immediate discharge. But from this course her best friends dissuaded her. The headmaster of Longworth College and Mr. Joynson, her trustee, were unanimous in counseling her to leave the boy alone, and Aunt Harriet cordially agreed with them. 'Let the lad serve his country!' she wrote to her niece. 'He is tall for his age, and if the Military Authorities have accepted him, well and good. It seems to me the one thing in the world that is likely to steady him and give him that sense of responsibility that hitherto he has so signally lacked. You will make the mistake of your life if you keep him back now.' It seemed funny to Winona to imagine Percy, so young and boyish, actually in His Majesty's uniform. He had not yet got his khaki, but he promised to have a photo taken as soon as ever he was in military garb, and she looked forward to showing the portrait of her soldier brother to the girls in her Form. She began a pair of socks for him at once. I regret to say that Winona's patriotic knitting had languished very much during the last two terms, but this personal stimulus revived her ardor. She even took her sock to the tennis court, and, emulating the example of Patricia Marshall and several other enthusiasts, got quite good pieces done between the sets. She would have taken it to cricket also, but Kirsty had sternly made a by-law prohibiting all knitting on the pitch since Ellinor Cooper, when supposed to be fielding, had surreptitiously taken her work from her pocket and missed the best catch of the afternoon, to her everlasting disgrace and the scorn of the indignant Games Captain. Kirsty was keen at present upon each Form having its own Eleven, and had arranged some school matches as trials of skill. The first of these, Sixth  v.  Fifth, was fixed for the following Saturday afternoon. Winona, to her ecstatic and delirious delight, had been elected captain of the combined V.a. and V.b. Eleven, and she was looking forward to the contest as one of the events of her life. She was aware that on its success or failure might hang much of her future athletic career at school, and she was determined to show of what stuff she was made. She urged her team to make heroic efforts, and got all the practice in that was available. On the Thursday afternoon she gave everybody a final drilling. On Friday the pitch would be the property of the Lower School, so this was the last opportunity of play before the match. 'If any of you muff the ball or do anything stupid, I'll never forgive you!' she assured her Eleven. 'The Sixth are A1 at fielding, so for goodness' sake don't disgrace our Form. Beware of Patricia's bowling. It looks simple, but it's the nastiest I know. I'd rather have Kirsty's any day, because at least you know what to expect from her, and you're on your guard. Don't try to be clever too soon; it's better not to score at all during the first over than to run any risks. Evelyn, you were a mascot to-day! I hope you'll play up equally well on Saturday. By the by, Joyce, I really can't compliment you on your innings. What were you thinking of to make that idiotic blind swipe?' 'I don't know!' returned Joyce dolefully. (She was sitting on the fence looking decidedly crestfallen.) 'I'm afraid I'm rather rocky to-day, somehow.' 'Got nerves? Girl alive! Do brace up!' 'No, it's not nerves. My head's been aching all the week, and I've a pain across my chest, and I keep shivering. I suppose I must have caught cold. It'll be a grizzly nuisance if I can't play on Saturday!' 'You  must  play!' urged Winona. 'We've got to beat the Sixth or perish in the attempt! You go home at once, and get some hot tea, and go to bed afterwards if you don't feel better. You may stop in bed all to-morrow if it'll do you good!' 'Thank you, Grannie! Perhaps I will go home now. I really am feeling rather queer.' 'She looks queer, too,' said Bessie Kirk to Winona, as they stood watching Joyce's retreating figure. 'I thought she was going to faint a while ago. It'll be a hideous nuisance if she has to be out of it.' 'Our best bowler! It's unthinkable!' groaned Winona. 'It's hard luck, but I'm certain Joyce won't play on Saturday,' said Mary Payne. The team was feeling rather down at the prospect. 'We may throw up the sponge if Joyce is off!' mourned Olave Parry. 'Shut up, you bluebottle!' snapped Winona, decidedly out of temper. 'Joyce may be absolutely well again by Saturday, and if she isn't Marjorie Kemp must take her place. Do be sporting! You'll never win if you make up your mind beforehand that you're going to lose!' When Winona walked into  V.a.  on the following morning she looked anxiously in the direction of Joyce's desk, but the familiar check dress and amber pigtail were not to be seen. Little groups of girls were standing in clusters, talking in apparent consternation. 'Well! Have you heard the news?' asked Garnet, stepping forward to meet her friend. 'No. What's the damage? You're looking very down in the dumps!' 'Joyce Newton has developed small-pox!' 'Nonsense!' exploded Winona. 'It's perfectly true,' said Garnet, with severe dignity in her voice. 'One only wishes for Joyce's sake that it wasn't! The news has only just come. Helena Maitland knows about it. She lives next door, and saw the doctor's car at the Newtons' gate this morning.' 'I told you Joyce looked queer yesterday!' said Bessie Kirk. 'Suppose we all catch it!' shuddered Freda Long. 'Don't! It's too horrible!' There was a feeling of utter consternation among the girls as the bad news was discussed. They wondered what was going to happen. 'Miss Bishop is telephoning to the Medical Officer of Health,' volunteered Olave Parry, who had been downstairs to seek fresh information. Just then Miss Huntley came into the room, though it was not yet nine o'clock. She went at once to her desk and took the call over. 'What's going to happen about Joyce?' one or two of the girls ventured to ask her. 'I don't know yet. I expect we shall all be put into quarantine. Miss Bishop is making arrangements. In the meantime we will go on with our work.' It was wise of Miss Huntley to begin the English Language lesson, for though every one was of course very abstracted, it gave some ostensible occupation. Before the hour was over Miss Bishop sailed into the room. She looked pale and anxious, but spoke with her usual calm dignity. 'Girls,' she announced, 'you have heard of the very difficult situation in which the school is placed. I have rung up Dr. Barnes, the Medical Officer of Health, and he tells me that the whole of  V.a.  must be regarded as 'contact cases.' That means that as Joyce has been amongst you, it is possible for any of you to develop the disease. In order to avoid the spread of infection throughout the city, you will have to be most carefully kept apart. I have sent all the other girls home, and you will stay at the school during to-day. Dr. Barnes is coming this morning to re-vaccinate you, and this afternoon you are to be taken to the Camp at Dunheath, where you will stay until the period of quarantine is over. Go home? Most certainly not! No girl is to leave the school on any pretext whatever. I am communicating with your home people and requesting that they send you a few necessary things to take to the camp, but no personal interviews can be allowed. Dr. Barnes' orders are most emphatic. You need not be alarmed, for if you are all re-vaccinated it is highly improbable that you will be infected, and I think you will all enjoy yourselves at Dunheath.' When the Principal had gone the girls clustered round Miss Huntley to discuss the situation. 'Yes, of course I'm going with you,' said the mistress. 'I'm a contact case as much as anybody else! Miss Bishop tells me that Dr. Barnes will send a hospital nurse with us. It's a nuisance to be in quarantine, but it will be beautiful out in the country just now, and we'll manage to enjoy ourselves.' The girls took the matter in various fashions according to their respective temperaments. Some were nervous, while others regarded it as a joke. The latter rallied their more timorous companions with scant mercy. 'Oh, buck up, you sillies!' said Marjorie Kemp, to the tearful plaints of Agatha James and Irene Mills. 'Vaccination doesn't hurt! It's nothing but a scratch. You might be going to have your arms cut off. For goodness' sake show some pluck! Suppose you were in the trenches? The Camp will be just topping. We'll have the time of our lives!' 'If we don't break out in spots!' wailed Irene. 'Well, wait till you do before you make a fuss. You're far more likely to catch a thing if you're afraid of it.' 'Oh, I say!' said Winona, suddenly remembering Saturday's event. 'The match to-morrow will be all off!' 'Hold me up! So it will! What a grizzly nuisance! Oh, the hard luck of it!' 'Well, it can't be helped! We must play the Sixth later on.' 'Kirsty'll be as savage as we are!' 'Poor old Joyce, she's responsible for a good deal of damage!' The rest of the day passed in an extraordinary fashion. V.a. had the whole of the school premises absolutely and entirely to itself. The Fourth Form room was turned into a temporary surgery, and Dr. Barnes installed himself there with tubes of vaccine and packets of new darning needles. Each girl in turn went first to Miss Bishop and had her arm thoroughly sterilized with boiled water and boracic lotion, and was then passed on to the medical officer for vaccination. The scratch with the needle really did not hurt, and the little operations were soon over. Sixteen maidens walking about waiting for their arms to dry before re-donning their blouses made a rather comical sight. The giggles that ensued raised the spirits of even Agatha and Irene. 'Glad it was done on our left arms! I expect we sha'n't be in much form for cricket after this, unless we play one-handed!' laughed Winona. 'By the by, will there be any field we can practice on out at the camp?' 'I expect so,' returned Miss Huntley. 'You had better make a collection of bats, balls and stumps and a few tennis rackets, and also your school books. Put them all together, and Miss Bishop will have them sent to us.' The girls hastened to sort out the necessary impedimenta for cricket and tennis, but arranged piles of books with less enthusiasm, the general opinion being that it was rather stiff to be expected to do work at the Camp. They were each allowed to take a book from the school library, and Miss Huntley added a pile of foolscap paper, pens and a big bottle of ink, which the girls devoutly hoped might get broken on the way and thus save them the labor of writing exercises. They had dinner and a four o'clock tea at school, after which meal Miss Bishop, who seemed to have spent most of the day at the telephone, announced that arrangements were now completed, and that they must get ready to start. Great was the excitement when at five o'clock a motor char-à-banc made its appearance. The sixteen 'contacts' and Miss Huntley took their places, their hand-bags, which had been sent from their respective homes during the course of the day, were stowed away with the rest of their luggage inside a motor 'bus, and the company, feeling much more like a picnic party than possibly infected cases, drove merrily away for their period of quarantine. CHAPTER XI The Open-air Camp If this particular Friday had been an exciting day to the girls of V.a., it had certainly proved a most agitating one to the Medical Officer of Health for Seaton. Upon his energy and organization depended the prevention of a serious epidemic in the city, and he had shown himself admirably able to cope with the sudden emergency. The Corporation had lately set up a camp for children threatened with tuberculosis, and this was commandeered by Dr. Barnes as a suitable place for quarantine. It lay five miles away from Seaton, on the top of a hill in a very open situation in the midst of fields, so was excellently fitted for the purpose. The children under treatment there had been hurriedly taken back to their homes in Seaton, extra beds and supplies had been sent out, and a hospital nurse installed in charge, so that all was in readiness when the char-à-banc arrived. The Camp consisted of a long wooden shelter or shed, the south side of which was entirely open to the air. The boarded floor was raised about three feet above the level of the field, and projected well beyond the roof line, thus forming a kind of terrace. Inside the shelter was a row of small beds, and a space was curtained off at either end, on one side for a kitchen and on the other to make a cubicle for Miss Huntley. Outside, under a large oak tree, stood a table and benches. Nothing could have been more absolutely plain and bare as regards furniture. The girls took possession, however, with the utmost enthusiasm. The idea of 'living the simple life' appealed to them. Who wanted chairs and chests of drawers and wash-stands? It would be fun to sleep in the shelter, and spend the whole day out of doors. 'It's too topping for anything!' declared Marjorie Kemp, after a careful inspection of the premises. 'We shall have to keep all our things inside our bags, and wash in an enameled tin basin, and drink our tea out of mugs!' 'It will be precious having meals under that tree!' agreed Bessie Kirk. 'What shall we do if it rains?' inquired Irene Mills. 'Go to bed with hot bottles, like the children did,' replied Nurse Robinson. 'They always thought that prime fun, so I expect you will too. You'll soon get into the life here.' The view from the shelter was most beautiful. In the far away distance they could see the towers of Seaton Minster and the spires of the churches, while all around lay lush meadows, fields of growing corn, and woods in the glory of June foliage. The Camp stood in the corner of a very large pasture, with hedges all covered with lovely wild roses and tangles of honeysuckle, while a wood close by showed a tempting vista of pine trees. The fresh country air and the smell of flowers and pines were delicious. Life at the Camp was arranged according to a strict time-table. Every one rose at seven, and a certain number of volunteers helped to prepare breakfast. Then came bed-making, crockery washing and potato peeling, at which duties the girls took turns. From 9.30 to 12.30 they had classes with Miss Huntley, while Nurse Robinson superintended the cooking of the dinner on the large oil stove. With the exception of an hour's preparation the rest of the day was free from lessons. Tea was at four and supper at seven, and by half-past nine every one was in bed, well covered with blankets, and with a hot bottle if she liked, for the nights were apt to be chilly to those unaccustomed to sleeping in the open-air. The rules of quarantine were of course sternly kept. No girl might go outside the pasture without special permission. Sometimes Miss Huntley took her flock for a walk along quiet country roads and rambling by-lanes, but the vicinity of their fellow-creatures was carefully avoided. 'We're like the lepers in the Middle Ages!' laughed Garnet. 'I feel as if I ought to wear a coarse white cassock, and ring a bell as I go about, to warn people to give me a wide berth!' 'It's amusing that the farmer has even driven his cows out of the pasture since we arrived,' said Evelyn. 'He let them feed here while the tuberculous children had their innings, and I should have thought consumption germs were as bad as small-pox ones.' 'They weren't real consumptives though, only threatened!' 'Well, we're not small-pox patients, either, only contacts!' 'I'm sorry for those poor kids, sent suddenly back to their slum homes after being here for weeks,' said Jess Gardner. 'Oh, the kids have had luck! There were only ten of them, and a lady at Hawberry has rigged up a tent in her garden, and has them all there, so Nurse told me this morning. They're living on the fat of the land, and gaining pounds and pounds in weight, by the look of them.' 'Good! I don't feel so bad at having turned them out, then. It's great here!' 'Rather! On the whole, I feel thoroughly grateful to Joyce.' From the girls' point of view there really was matter for congratulation. None of them was ill, and all were having a most delightful and quite unexpected three weeks' holiday in idyllic surroundings. Their arms, to be sure, had 'taken,' and were more or less sore, but that was a trifling inconvenience compared with the pleasures of living in Camp. There was no anxiety to be felt about Joyce, she had the disease very slightly, and was being treated with such extreme care that her face would not be marked afterwards. It was ascertained that she had caught the infection from some Belgians who had come over lately from Holland, and who were now isolated by Dr. Barnes in a Cottage Hospital. The Seaton High School was undergoing elaborate disinfection, and as June was well advanced, the Governors had decided not to re-open until September, when all possibility of contagion would have passed away. This was the only part of the proceedings that did not please the girls. 'It's rather sickening to have no end to the term,' groaned Marjorie. 'Our matches are all off, and no swimming display or sports. It's rough on Margaret and Kirsty particularly. Do you realize that when we go back in September they'll both have left? All the prefects are leaving.' 'Oh, hard luck! Who'll take their places?' 'Some of our noble selves, I suppose, if we're promoted to the Sixth.' 'Who'll be General and Games Captain?' 'Ah! Ask me a harder, my intelligent child.' 'I think I could put my finger on one of them, at any rate.' 'So could I, perhaps, but I don't care to prophesy too soon,' sighed Bessie. Whoever might be destined to wear future laurels at school, Winona, as Captain of the V.a. team, assumed direction of the games at the Camp. Part of the pasture was sufficiently level to make quite a fair cricket pitch, while a piece in the opposite corner served as a tennis court. An old man from the farm was bribed to come and cut the grass with a scythe, but as no lawn-mower or roller was available, the result was decidedly rough. The tennis enthusiasts rigged up a tape in lieu of a net, and marked some courts with lime begged from the farmer. Their games, owing to the general bumpiness of the ground, had at least the charm of variety and excitement, and four umpires had to keep careful and continual watch in order to decide whether the balls went over or under the tape, which indeed collapsed occasionally, as the poles were only sticks cut from the hedge. If the tennis was funny, the cricket was even funnier. Many of the girls could not use their left arms at all, consequently the batting was extraordinary, and sometimes the easiest catches were missed. It was very amusing, however, and perhaps for that reason provided more entertainment than the most strict and orthodox play under the critical eye of Kirsty might have done. Really the quarantine party had a most idyllic time. In the warm June weather it was delightful to live out of doors. There were rosy-violet dawns and golden-red sunsets, and clear starry nights when the planet Venus shone like a lamp in the dark blue of the sky, and owls would fly hooting from the woods, and bats come flitting round the shelter in search of moths. One day, indeed, was wet, but the girls sat or lay on their beds, and read or talked, and played games, with intervals of exciting dashes in mackintoshes to fetch cans of water, or dishes from the larder. On Sundays there was of course no church-going, but Miss Huntley read morning prayers, and in the evening they sang hymns, each girl in turn choosing the one she liked best. 'All things bright and beautiful,' 'Nearer, my God, to Thee,' and 'Now the day is over' were prime favorites, but perhaps the most popular of all was the ancient Hymn of St. Patrick, which Miss Huntley had copied from a book of Erse literature, and had adapted to an old Irish tune. The girls learnt it easily, and its fifth century Celtic mysticism fascinated them. They liked such bits as:     'In light of sun, in gleam of snow     Myself I bind;     In speed of lightning, in depth of sea     In swiftness of wind.     God's Might to uphold me,     God's Wisdom to guide,     God's shield to protect me     In desert and wild.'                   'Christ with me, before me,     Behind me and in me,     O Threeness in Oneness     I praise and adore Thee.' 'In Ireland it is sometimes called the Shamrock Hymn,' said Miss Huntley, 'because St. Patrick used the little green shamrock leaf to explain to the chiefs the doctrine of the Holy Trinity. The original is in a very ancient dialect of the Irish Celtic, and was preserved in an old manuscript book written on parchment. It always reminds me of the 'Benedicite omnia opera' of our prayer-book; the thought is the same in both: 'O ye spirits and souls of the righteous, bless ye the Lord' is about the sum of it all.' Except for the trifling trouble of vaccination, the effects of which in most cases were soon over, the quarantine party enjoyed radiant health. Dr. Barnes came twice a week to inspect, and Nurse Robinson kept a vigilant watch for headaches, back-aches, and sickness. None of these symptoms appeared, however, and all began to congratulate themselves that the infection had been avoided. There was a burst of warm weather at the beginning of July, which made the hill breezes of Dunheath highly acceptable. It was too hot during the daytime to play active games; the girls lounged about under the shade of the trees, and read the illustrated papers with which they were kept plentifully supplied. 'I've never really had time before to study the toilet hints,' said Beatrice Howell one afternoon, poring over a certain page headed 'My Lady's Boudoir.' 'It seems to me that we ought to take our complexions more seriously. We actually wash our faces with soap and water, and 'Lady Veronica' says here that that's an absolutely suicidal practice for delicate skins. She gives all kinds of recipes for what one should do. I wish I could have a few lessons in face massage. I wonder how hard one ought to rub? And why a downward movement all the time?' (Beatrice was stroking her cheeks contemplatively as she spoke.) 'Why mayn't you rub upwards?' 'The Princess recommends gentle pinching,' said Mollie Hill, who was studying the columns of a rival paper, 'and then an application of Mrs. Courtenay's lavender cream. We ought to be careful not to get freckled or sunburnt. 'Lady Marjorie' gives some splendid prescriptions against both. I wonder how the papers always get the aristocracy to write their Beauty Hints? I shouldn't have thought they'd have condescended to reveal their secrets!' 'My good girl! Don't flatter yourself that either 'Lady Veronica' or 'Lady Marjorie' is a member of the aristocracy,' chuckled Bessie Kirk. 'They're probably most plebeian and dowdy-looking individuals living in Bloomsbury boarding-houses, with pasty complexions and freckled noses, and they get a percentage on the preparations they recommend. If you notice, they always tell you to use Mrs. Somebody's pomade or face cream, and it's generally very expensive.' 'Oh, but this one's home-made!' declared Beatrice. 'Look here! It says: 'Take an ounce of spermaceti, and melt it in a pan with a teacupful of rose water. When thoroughly mixed, add an ounce of Vodax, which may be obtained from any chemist, stir until quite cold, then put into pots.' I'm sure that sounds simple enough, in all conscience.' 'What about the Vodax, though? If you went to the chemist's you'd find it is a patent preparation, and very expensive, and it would just knock the bottom out of the 'home-made' theory of the recipe.' 'There must be something in all these hints, though,' said Mollie plaintively, 'or the paper wouldn't publish them every week.' 'Well, perhaps there is, to a certain extent, but just think of the time it would take to carry them out, to say nothing of the expense of cosmetics. Here, give me the book a sec, and a piece of pencil. I want to make a calculation. Now, if you really follow 'Lady Marjorie's' advice, your day will run something like this. It's a kind of beauty time-table: Face Massage, Morning                                       10 minutes  '     '      Evening                                       10   ' Hair Drill, Morning                                         15   '  '     '    Evening                                         15   ' Application of cloths wrung out in hot water to face daily  30   ' Breathing Exercises                                         15   ' Physical    '                                               15   ' Manicure                                                     5   ' Oatmeal applications                                         5   '                                                             , -                                                        Total 2 hours. 'Now, if you're going to put in two hours every day at your toilet, it seems to me that you won't have much time left for games, unless you can get your prep. excused on the ground that you're studying beauty culture. I'd like to see Bunty's face if you asked her!' 'Don't be piggish!' said Mollie. 'One has no need to cultivate a tough skin, just because one's fond of cricket and hockey. I hate to see girls with hard red cheeks and freckles.' It was certainly not possible to obtain Mrs. Courtenay's lavender cream or any other toilet specialties at the Camp. Beatrice and Mollie, however, impressed with the necessity of preserving their complexions, commandeered some of the buttermilk which was sent daily from the farm, and dabbed it plentifully over their faces before retiring to bed, following the application with massage to the best of their ability. They were emulated in these toilet rites by Agatha James, Mary Payne and Olave Parry, who also studied the beauty hints columns, and liked to try experiments. One day Agatha found an entirely new suggestion in a copy of 'The Ladies' Portfolio.' A correspondent wrote strongly advocating common salt as a hair tonic. It was to be rubbed in at night, and brushed out again in the morning. Apparently nothing could be more simple. Beatrice, being on kitchen duty, had access to the salt-box. She purloined a good breakfastcupful, and divided the spoils with her four confederates. They all rubbed the salt carefully into the roots of their hair. Next morning, however, when they essayed to brush it out again, it obstinately refused to budge, and remained hard and gritty among their tresses. They were very much concerned. What was to be done? The only obvious remedy was to wash their hair. Now the one drawback of the Camp was its shortage of water. The daily supply had to be carried in buckets from the farm, and as, owing to the warm dry weather, the well was getting low, their allowance at present was rather small, and had to be carefully husbanded. The amount doled out for washing purposes certainly was quite inadequate for the due rinsing of five plentiful heads of hair. 'I suppose we shall just have to grin and bear it till we can get home and can mermaid properly in a bath!' sighed Mary. 'Oh, I can't! I'm going to wash mine somehow. Look here, suppose we sneak off quietly this afternoon, and go on a water hunt?' 'There isn't a stream or a pond anywhere near.' 'We haven't tried the wood!' 'Well, we're not allowed there, of course.' 'I don't see why we shouldn't go. The young pheasants must be all hatched, and running about by this time, so what harm could we do? Besides which, nobody's troubling about preserving game during the war. They're shooting Germans instead of birds this year.' 'Very likely the gamekeeper has enlisted,' suggested Beatrice, 'in which case there'd be no one to stop us.' Now the strict law of the Camp confined the girls to the pasture, but as it was the last week of the quarantine, they were beginning to grow a little slack about rules. The five victims of the salt cure waited until Miss Huntley and Nurse Robinson were enjoying their afternoon siesta; then, without waiting for any permission, they climbed the fence into the lane, found a thin place in the hedge, and scrambled into the wood. It was a thrillingly exciting experience. Rather scratched and panting, they surveyed the prospect. Trees were everywhere, with a thick undergrowth of bramble and bracken. Apparently there was no path at all. 'I suppose we shall just have to wander about till we see a pond!' remarked Agatha. 'I believe some people can find water with a forked hazel twig,' said Olave. 'They hold it loosely in their hands, and it jerks when the water's near. I wish I knew how to do it!' 'Oh, water-finders are occult people,' laughed Beatrice, 'the sort that see spooks and do table-turning, you know. Besides, they find underground water, and tell where wells ought to be dug. We want a pond which any one can see with the naked eye, without being endowed with psychic powers. My natural reason tells me to go down hill, and perhaps we'll strike it in a hollow.' The girls rambled on, thoroughly enjoying the coolness of the shade and the beauty of the wood. As Beatrice had prophesied, when they reached the foot of the incline they came across quite a good-sized pool, with reeds and iris growing on its banks. They rejoiced exceedingly. Now it is one thing to wash one's hair in a bath or a basin, but quite another to perform that operation in a pond with shallow muddy edges. The girls took off their shoes and stockings, tucked up their skirts and waded into the middle, where they made gallant efforts at dipping and rinsing their heads, and contrived to get uncommonly wet in the process. They wrung out their dripping tresses, mopped them with handkerchiefs (for nobody had dared to take a towel), and spread them out over their shoulders to dry. There was an open glade close by, where they could squat in the sunshine, and let the breeze help the process. Mary had had the forethought to put a comb in her pocket and she lent it round in turns. They were sitting in a row, like five mermaids, extremely complacent and satisfied with themselves, when footsteps suddenly crashed through the wood, and a middle-aged man approached them. For once Beatrice's calculations were wrong. The gamekeeper had not yet enlisted. No doubt he would have been far better employed in the trenches somewhere in France, but here he was, still in England, and looking extremely surly and truculent. 'You've no business to be in this wood,' he began. 'Can't you read the trespass notices? There's plenty of them about. What do you mean by coming in here, disturbing the pheasants?' 'We aren't doing any harm!' protested Olave. 'That's neither here nor there. You've no business here, and you know it! Are you from that camp up the hill?' 'Yes.' 'Then take yourselves off at once, spreading small-pox!' 'We've none of us had small-pox!' returned Beatrice indignantly. 'We've told you we weren't doing any harm. Still, if this will make things right, , ' and she slipped half-a-crown into his hand. The gamekeeper's expression changed considerably, and his tone instantly became more respectful. 'Well, young ladies, I have to do my duty, and of course you understand the pheasants mustn't be disturbed anyhow. Perhaps you won't mind going back to the Camp now. I'll show you a path that will take you into the lane.' He led the way, and the girls followed in subdued silence, feeling rather crestfallen. Mollie was yearning to tell him that he ought to be doing his duty by his country instead of by the pheasants. If at that moment she could have found a white feather, I believe she would have presented it to him. The path ended in a small gate which he unlocked. He ushered them solemnly into the lane, pointed out a trespass notice that was nailed conspicuously on to a tree, and then retired into the fastnesses of the wood. The girls decided that, unless actually compelled, they would not divulge where they had been. 'It was a bit of hard luck to be caught!' giggled Olave. 'Didn't you feel queer when he came up?' 'I thought he was a beast, and didn't deserve propitiating with a tip!' declared Agatha. 'But we washed our hair!' rejoiced Mary, plaiting her long dark pigtail. CHAPTER XII Captain Winona To the entire satisfaction of themselves, their relations, and Dr. Barnes, the girls passed safely through their period of quarantine, and were certified as fit once more to take their places among the rest of the world. They left the Camp almost with regret. They had been such a jolly, merry party, and had enjoyed such high jinks there, that they felt their departure closed a pleasant episode. They were going straight home to holidays, however, which was a very different matter from returning to work. The remainder of July and the month of August passed very swiftly to Winona. She missed Percy, who was in training with his regiment, but since the advent of their new governess, Letty and Mamie had grown more sensible, and proved quite pleasant companions. Letty especially seemed suddenly to have awakened, so far as her intellectual capacities were concerned. She had begun to devour Scott and Dickens, took a keen interest in nature study, and tried, sometimes with rather comical effect, to be extremely superior and grown-up. 'She's far cleverer really than I am,' thought Winona. 'Pity she's not at the Seaton High! She'd be the star of her form directly. I wish she could get a scholarship some day.' With her school experience in coaching juniors, Winona was able to give her family some drilling in the matter of cricket, though she did not find that younger brothers and sisters proved such docile pupils as the members of III.a. and III.b. It was the usual case of 'a prophet is not without honor, save in his own country,' and while to High School juniors she preserved the authority and dignity of a senior, to Letty, Mamie, Ernie, Godfrey, and Dorrie she was 'only Winona.' She practiced tennis with the Vicarage girls, and was surprised to find how much her play had improved. Last summer they had nearly always beaten her, now it was she who scored the victories. 'I've learnt how to play games at 'The High,' even if my report was only moderate,' she said to herself. To make up for the long holiday caused by the small-pox scare, school was to commence at the beginning of September. Aunt Harriet, who had not been well, and was taking a rest in Scotland, wrote that her house in Abbey Close was shut up for the present, but that she was making other arrangements for her great-niece until her return. This term a hostel was to be opened in connection with the High School, and Winona was to be a boarder there for a few weeks. She was uncertain whether she liked the prospect or not, but she nevertheless left home in good spirits. The hostel was under the superintendence of Miss Kelly. It was prettily furnished, and looked bright and pleasant. The girls had a common sitting-room, where they could read, write, paint or play games, and the bedrooms were divided into cubicles. So far there were only ten boarders, though there was accommodation for eighteen, but no doubt the numbers would be increased when the venture became better known. The school seemed very strange without the familiar figures of Margaret Howell, Kirsty Paterson, Patricia Marshall and the other prefects. All of the Sixth had left except Linda Fletcher and Dorrie Pollock, and the members of V.a. were now promoted to the top form. Linda Fletcher was head of the school, the new prefects being Hilda Langley, Agatha James, Bessie Kirk, Grace Olliver, Evelyn Richards and Garnet Emerson. Linda, with her past year's experience, made an extremely suitable 'Head.' She understood thoroughly what ought to be done, and at once called a mass meeting of the whole school in the gymnasium. Everybody clapped as Linda stood up on the platform to open the proceedings. She had been a favorite as a prefect, so she was welcomed in her new capacity of 'General.' 'Girls!' she began. 'I felt it was better to lose no time in calling this meeting to settle the affairs of the coming school year. I am in a difficult position, because I have to follow such an extremely able and efficient 'Head.' I'm afraid I can't hope to rival Margaret Howell (cries of 'Yes! Yes!' and 'You'll do!' from the audience), but at least I shall try to do my duty. During the past year we may fairly consider that the 'Seaton High' made enormous strides. Owing to the exertions of our former 'Head' and prefects a most excellent foundation has been laid. The Dramatic Society, the Debating Club, the Literary Association, the Photographic Union and the Natural History League all accomplished very satisfactory work, and may be considered in a most flourishing condition. Perhaps, though, our greatest improvement is in the direction of games. This may not appear on the surface, for though we won five hockey matches, it was impossible, for reasons well known to you, to have fixtures for hockey and tennis. We feel, nevertheless, that in spite of our inability to test our skill against that of other schools we are conscious of the enormous all-round improvement that has taken place in our play. It was Kirsty Paterson's policy to train recruits for the games so that every girl in the school might be a possible champion. How well she succeeded I hope our next season's matches may testify. Let us all work together for the good of the school, and try to establish the reputation of the 'Seaton High.' I need not remind you that everything in the coming year will depend upon the energy and efficiency of the Games Captain. As soon as I knew that I was 'Head,' I wrote to Kirsty, who is staying in Cornwall, and asked for her opinion upon this most important point. I want to read you an extract from her reply, which I received this morning. She says: ''You ask me who is to be the new Games Captain. Well, of course it is a delicate matter to nominate my own successor, but from my knowledge of everybody's capacities I should most decidedly suggest Winona Woodward. She is a good all-round player herself, and has a particular aptitude for organization, which should prove invaluable. She thoroughly appreciates the advantage of having reserves to fall back upon, and is most keen on keeping up the standard. I do hope the dear old 'High' will have a splendid year. I shall be frantic to hear how you get on. Send me a p.c. with the result of the meeting.' 'Well,' continued Linda, 'you've heard Kirsty's opinion. It coincides entirely with mine. Will some one kindly propose that Winona Woodward shall be elected Games Captain?' 'I have much pleasure in making the proposal,' said Bessie Kirk, standing up promptly. 'And I have much pleasure in seconding it,' murmured Grace Olliver. 'Will all who are in favor kindly hold up their hands? Carried unanimously! I'm extremely glad, as I'm sure Winona is 'the right man for the job,' and worthy to carry on Kirsty's traditions. I vote we give her three cheers!' Winona flushed crimson as the hip-hip-hoorays rang forth. She had never expected such a complete walk-over. She had known that her name was to be submitted for the captaincy, but she had thought that Bessie Kirk and Marjorie Kemp held equal chances, and that the voting would probably be fairly evenly divided. That Kirsty should have written to nominate her was an immense gratification. Kirsty's praise at the time had been scant, and Winona had no idea that her former chief held her in such esteem. To Winona the occasion seemed the triumph of her life. She would rather be Games Captain than have any other honor that could possibly be offered to her. Glorious visions of successful matches, of shields or cups won, and a county reputation for the school swam before her eyes. And she, Winona Woodward, was to have the privilege of leading and directing all this! It was indeed a thrilling prospect. Her thoughts went back to the symposium of a year ago, when as a new and unknown girl, she had listened to Margaret Howell's inspiring speech. How unlikely it had seemed then that she would ever have a hand in making school history, but how her spirit had been stirred, and how she had longed to do her part! It was something to have realized her pet ambition. 'It was most awfully good of you to propose me,' she said to Bessie Kirk afterwards. 'You'd a splendid chance yourself.' 'Not I!' returned Bessie lightly. 'Kirsty's letter settled the whole business. I shouldn't have made nearly as good a Captain as you. I don't care to bother with the kids, and I'd hate all the business part of it, making the fixtures and that sort of thing, you know. You'll be A1, and we'll all play up no end. I believe we dare venture a fixture with Grant Park this season.' Winona fully realized the responsibilities of her important position, and began at once to pick up the threads of her new duties. She took possession of the Games Register, with its records of past matches, and began to make plans for hockey fixtures. The term had begun so early that the other schools in the county had not yet re-opened; that, however, was really an advantage, as it gave her more time for consideration. At present the September weather was hot as summer, and tennis and cricket were still in full swing. In order to spur on enthusiasm Winona organized a school tennis tournament. The result was highly satisfactory. Several new and unsuspected stars swam into view, and she determined to keep her eye upon them as possible champions for next summer. 'You never know what a girl's capable of till you try her!' she confided to Garnet. 'Who would ever have thought that that stupid-looking little Emily Cooper could beat Ethel March? I was simply astounded. I've my plans for Emily, I can tell you! And I believe Bertha March is going to be a second Annie Hardy. She serves in exactly the same way. Oh, I've hopes for next summer. Brilliant, glorious hopes.' The school took every opportunity of using the fine weather while it lasted. The Photographic Union organized an outing to Linworth, a picturesque town six miles away, where an old castle, an Elizabethan mansion, a river and many quaint streets made subjects for their cameras, and promised to provide materials for an exhibition later on, when films were developed and prints taken. The Natural History League had another delightful ramble under Miss Lever's leadership, and secured additional specimens for the museum. On this occasion Winona and Garnet started in better time for the station, and did not get into the wrong train, as they had done on the expedition to Monkend Woods. 'Dollikins,' as Miss Lever was affectionately nicknamed, was as great a favorite as ever among the girls. Owing to changes on the staff, she now had charge of IV.a. and taught mathematics throughout the junior forms, so that the seniors saw little of her in school hours. On a ramble she was as jolly as one of themselves. The Sixth had a new mistress, Miss Goodson, who had only joined the staff this term. The form was rather uncertain whether to like her or not. It was rumored that she had been engaged specially to coach them for the matriculation. So far the High School had been laying foundations, and had not sent in any candidates for public examinations. This year, however, having a certain amount of promising material in the Sixth, Miss Bishop had decided that the time was ripe for trying to win the educational laurels towards which their training had been directed. Miss Goodson came from a High School in the north, and brought with her a reputation for successful coaching. She was well up in all her subjects, but she was a cold and not very inspiring person. She was apt to concentrate her energies on the clever members of her form, and leave the less brilliant to stumble along as best they could. Winona, who certainly belonged to the second category, did not like Miss Goodson, while Garnet was strongly in her favor. In her new capacity of prefect, Garnet proved a success. She was as enthusiastic over the 'bookish' side of the school as Winona over the athletic department. She was President of the Literary Association, a member of the Debating Club Committee, and head librarian. The school library had grown and prospered exceedingly since its installation by Margaret Howell. It now numbered nearly five hundred volumes, and its shelves almost filled the Prefects' Room. Garnet managed it systematically. She had special hours at which books were issued, and assistants whose business it was to be on duty at the specified times. Among other improvements in the school welcomed by the girls was the advent of a fresh drilling mistress, and some new apparatus for gymnastics. Under Miss Barbour, 'Gym' became highly popular, and it was felt that an athletic display would probably be held at Christmas. This was something to work for, and every one seemed much keener than formerly. Winona was naturally an enthusiast, and tried to keep others up to the mark. She had once seen an 'Assault-at-Arms' at Percy's college, and the memory of it made her long for the Seaton High School to have a similar opportunity of showing its prowess. She and a select circle of friends practiced whenever possible. Altogether among the various athletic activities of the school, Captain Winona promised herself a very enjoyable year in the Sixth Form. CHAPTER XIII The Hostel Aunt Harriet had intended to return home towards the end of September, but her health continued so unsatisfactory that her doctor ordered her to Harrogate to drink the waters, and advised a long period of rest and change before again taking up the many occupations with which she busied herself in Seaton. Miss Beach was a restive patient, and Dr. Sidwell knew that if he once allowed her to be within reach of committees, she would plunge herself into work, while to keep away from the scenes of her former activity was her only chance of recovery. The house in Abbey Close was still shut up, and Winona for the present term was established at the Hostel. On the whole she liked it. She missed certain things, particularly her own bedroom, and the quiet dining-room where she had been accustomed to prepare her lessons, but life in a community had its compensations. It was a nuisance to have to sleep in the same dormitory with Betty Carlisle, who snored offensively, but, on the other hand, Winona's cubicle was next to the window, with the little balcony that overlooked the park, and every morning she could watch an aëroplane hovering and flitting like a beautiful dragon-fly over the city. Seaton possessed a Government aircraft factory, and each finished machine had to be carefully tested. All the girls in the school were extremely interested in the exploits of Lieutenant Mainwaring, a member of the Flying Corps, who might constantly be seen practicing. He was a cousin of Elsie Mainwaring, a Fifth Form girl. Elsie recorded his doings with immense pride, and provided up-to-date information of his whereabouts. He was a very daring young fellow, and was reported to have looped the loop. Winona had never witnessed the performance of this feat, so she looked out eagerly each day, hoping she might have the luck to see him do it. When the biplane came swooping over the park, she would wave her handkerchief to it from the balcony by way of encouragement. She was immensely patriotic, and she considered that our airmen deserved praise almost beyond any other branch of our forces. She often wished Percy were in the Flying Squadron. She cut out all the pictures of aëroplanes from the Seaton  Graphic , and pinned them up in her cubicle. There was a portrait of Lieutenant Mainwaring among the number, and this she placed on her dressing-table, side by side with Percy's photograph. According to Elsie it was a very bad likeness, but as Winona had not seen the original, except at a distance, she had no means of judging. Curiosity led her to borrow a pair of field-glasses from Garnet. She was standing one morning on the balcony when the aëroplane came in sight, and hovered quite low down over the park, exactly opposite the hostel windows. Through her glasses Winona could plainly see the occupant. The impulse to smile and wave was irresistible. To her immense surprise the signal was returned. In frantic excitement she waved again, and shouted 'Hooray!' 'What are you doing, Winona Woodward?' snapped a voice behind her, and turning guiltily, she found herself face to face with Miss Kelly. 'I, I was only looking at the aëroplane,' stammered Winona. 'Come in at once! You know perfectly well that this sort of thing is not allowed. I am very much surprised and disgusted. If I find you signaling to gentlemen again from this balcony, I shall change your dormitory. Whose field-glasses are those?' 'Garnet Emerson's,' said Winona sulkily. 'Then you must give them back to Garnet this morning. Remember, that such unladylike conduct must never happen again at the hostel.' Winona considered herself very much aggrieved. She had waved on the spur of the moment, and to have her innocent and impulsive act construed into 'signaling to gentlemen,' and reproved as 'unladylike conduct,' was highly aggravating. Miss Kelly was a disciplinarian, and of a very suspicious temperament. Her idea of duty was the French one of 'surveillance.' She never trusted the girls, or put them upon their honor; her mode of procedure was to keep an eye upon them, and to pop in suddenly and surprise them. They resented this attitude extremely. 'Miss Kelly always gives us credit for going to do the very worst!' grumbled Betty Carlisle. 'She puts ideas into our heads!' declared Doris Hooper indignantly. The gist of the trouble was this: the girls at the hostel expected to have as much liberty as if they were in their own homes, while Miss Kelly, who had formerly been a mistress at St. Chad's, wished to enforce strict boarding-school rules. It was much more difficult to do this because the hostel only formed part of a large day school; the general atmosphere of the place was more free than at a college where all alike are boarders, and the girls naturally were infected by the prevailing spirit. A constant source of annoyance was the rule that they must report themselves in the hostel at 4.15. It was the fashion to linger after school, and chat in the 'gym' or in the playground. It was a delightful little time, when everybody could meet every one else, and discuss school news and matches and guilds and other interesting topics. To be obliged, for no particular reason, to cut short their conversations and race back to the hostel was annoying. The boarders evaded the rule as far as possible, but Miss Kelly kept a roll-call, and they knew that their absences would be duly reported to Miss Bishop. To Winona, in especial, many of the rules were extremely irksome. At more than sixteen and a half, she felt it ridiculous to be obliged to ask permission to go out and buy a lead pencil at the stationer's. 'It's like living in a convent!' she fumed. Another bone of contention was her preparation. She had been so accustomed to work in a room by herself at Abbey Close that she found the presence of others highly distracting. Though silence was enforced, the girls fluttered the leaves of their books, scratched with their pens, or even murmured dates under their breath, all of which sounds were most irritating. Winona begged to be allowed to take her books to her cubicle, but Miss Kelly would not hear of it. [Illustration: 'TO SEE A REAL LIVE AIRMAN AT SUCH CLOSE QUARTERS WAS NOT AN ORDINARY EXPERIENCE'] 'I cannot make an exception for one,' she replied, 'and it would be impossible to allow girls to work as they liked in the dormitories. There would be more talking than preparation! You'll stay here with the others, and I can see for myself what you're doing.' The hint that Miss Kelly suspected her of some ulterior motive for wishing to study upstairs enraged Winona, but she was obliged to submit, and to sit, close under the mistress' eye, at the long table, in company with her fellow-boarders. Her work suffered in consequence, and Miss Goodson's sarcasms descended on her head. Miss Goodson was not so patient a teacher as Miss Huntley, and Winona tried her temper at times. Winona was subject to curious fits of stupidity. Her brains were like a clock with a broken cog. Sometimes they would work easily, and on other days she seemed quite unable to grasp the most obvious problems. A lively imagination may be a very delightful possession, and of use in the writing of history and literature exercises, but it cannot supply the place of solid facts, nor is it of the least aid in mathematics, so Winona's form record was not high. The hockey season would commence at the beginning of October, but during September, while the weather was still warm, the girls continued to play cricket on Wednesdays. The school was fortunate enough to possess large playing fields; these adjoined the public park, in itself a big area, so that quite a fine open space lay below the buildings. One afternoon, just as Winona was having her innings, Elsie Mainwaring uttered a cry, and pointed overhead. Far up in the clouds was the aëroplane, and it was gracefully looping the loop. 'It's Harry! He's showing off for our benefit!' squealed Elsie excitedly. 'I told him we should be playing cricket to-day. Oh! didn't he do it cleverly? He went just straight head over heels in the air! Let's wave to him, and perhaps he'll come down a little.' Handkerchiefs fluttered out so briskly that the field resembled a washing day. Miss Barbour was signaling as vigorously as the rest. Evidently Lieutenant Mainwaring took the display for an invitation, the biplane descended like a hawk, and to every one's immense gratification alighted on the school ground. To see a real live airman at such close quarters was not an ordinary experience. Elsie promptly introduced her cousin to Miss Barbour and begged that they might all inspect the machine. Lieutenant Mainwaring good-naturedly explained the various parts; perhaps he rather enjoyed a visit to a Ladies' School! He did not stay long, however, but after a few minutes started his engine and went soaring up again into the blue of the sky, and wheeling over the towers of the old Minster was soon lost to sight behind some clouds. 'It must be glorious to fly!' sighed Winona. In spite of Miss Kelly's injunctions she could not help looking out of her window every morning for the aëroplane, and giving a surreptitious wave. She told herself that she was only acting patriotically in cheering on our aërial defenses. The back of the hostel opened into the school playground, and one day Winona, taking a run there for exercise before breakfast, heard the familiar whirring, and looking up, beheld the flying-machine poised just overhead. She heard a shout from the occupant, and something dropped into the playground. She ran to pick it up. It was a packet of chocolates! She tried to wave thanks, but the biplane had moved on, and was now far over the town, Lieutenant Mainwaring no doubt having enjoyed his little joke of innocent bomb-dropping. Now most unfortunately for Winona, Miss Kelly's bedroom window overlooked the playground, and she had been a witness of the whole incident. She came out now in extreme wrath, confiscated the chocolates, and scolded Winona sharply. 'But it's not my fault! I'd no idea he was going to drop anything!' protested Winona indignantly. 'After what has happened before, I can only draw my own conclusions,' returned the mistress icily. 'You will change to Number 3 dormitory to-day.' 'But, Miss Kelly, , ' 'Don't argue! I warned you that I should move you if I found any more signaling going on. Your aunt will have to hear about this!' When Winona returned to the hostel that afternoon, and went upstairs, she found that all her possessions had been cleared out of Number 2 dormitory, and placed in Number 3, which being at the side of the house had no view except the school buildings. The contents of her drawers had been transferred intact; her brushes, books and home photos were placed on her new dressing-table, but all the pictures of aëroplanes and the portrait of Lieutenant Mainwaring, which she had cut out of the Seaton  Graphic , had disappeared. Winona sat down on the bed and laughed. She was very much annoyed, but the humor of the situation appealed to her. 'It's too idiotic of Miss Kelly! Does she think I'm going to elope in an aëroplane? I never heard of anything so silly in my life! She may tell Aunt Harriet if she pleases. I don't care! Why, I don't suppose Lieutenant Mainwaring knows me from any other girl in the school. He just dropped those chocs. on spec. It was a shame I wasn't allowed to eat them!' Miss Kelly, very keen on upholding discipline in her new hostel, considered that she had successfully squashed an incipient flirtation, and kept a stern eye on all the elder girls, and most particularly on Winona, for fear some repetition of the offense might occur. The boarders were justly indignant. 'Too bad!' was the general verdict. 'Winona's not a scrap that sort of girl really, if Miss Kelly only knew. It's absurd to make such a fuss.' Out of sheer bravado and love of mischief, the remaining occupants of Number 2 dormitory waved not only handkerchiefs but towels from the balcony when they heard the whirring of the aëroplane overhead, enjoying the exciting sensation that any moment they might be pounced upon by Miss Kelly. No doubt in time they would have been discovered in the act, but at the end of three days Lieutenant Mainwaring was sent to the front, and his successor, not having a cousin at the Seaton High School, took no interest in school girls, and flew over the city oblivious of everything except his engines. 'I don't suppose he'd notice if we waved a sheet!' said Betty Carlisle disappointedly. 'The police might though, and they'd think you were signaling to Germans,' replied Doris Hooper. 'Come in, Bet, it's no use! Girl alive, quick! I hear the dragon's fairy footsteps in the passage. Do you want to get your head bitten off?' In spite of occasional hostilities with Miss Kelly, Winona managed to have a good deal of fun at the hostel. The other girls were jolly, and in the evenings, when preparation was finished, they would play games together in their sitting-room. There were high jinks in the dormitories, and small excitements over little happenings, which, however trivial they might be, provided considerable entertainment to the participants. Only one really stormy incident occurred during Winona's term at the hostel, and that had nothing to do with Miss Kelly. One Saturday morning, when Winona, Betty and Doris were in the town shopping, they happened to meet Clarice Nixon, who stopped to chat, and ask for school news. 'I feel fearfully out of things now I've left,' said Clarice. 'It'll be a stale winter without hockey.' 'Why don't you join a Club?' suggested Winona. 'Shouldn't care to! It would be no fun to play with a team I don't know. The Seaton Ladies' Club is the only decent one, and I hear they're so cliquey. I wish we could get up an Old Girls' Hockey Club!' 'Why, that would be simply glorious! What a splendiferous idea! Oh, do let us try! Then we could have a Past  versus  Present match. Oh! wouldn't it be precious?' 'Have you settled up your fixtures?' 'Very nearly.' 'Then we ought to get this thing in hand at once. You're Games Captain, so you ought to organize it. Write round to-day to all the old girls you know, and ask them to come to a meeting on Monday.' 'Isn't that rather soon?' said Betty. 'Not a bit. No time must be wasted, if the club's to be a going concern for this season. Don't let the grass grow under your feet, is my advice.' Winona was naturally impulsive. The idea appealed to her so immensely, that she straightway bought a packet of postcards and a number of halfpenny stamps, and sent out her invitations. As she was bound to report herself in the hostel at 4.15, she decided to call the meeting there at 4.20. It could be held in the sitting-room, and there would be plenty of time to discuss matters before five o'clock tea. She wrote to Margaret Howell, Kirsty Paterson, and all the former members of the Sixth, and was already exulting over the success which she hoped would accrue. She was sure every one in the school would like the notion when they heard about it. On Monday morning when she walked into her form room, she noticed several of the prefects talking together. They looked at her significantly as she entered, and Evelyn Richards made a movement as if about to speak. Grace Olliver, however, laid her hand on Evelyn's arm, and pointed to the clock, as if deferring the matter. At eleven 'break,' as the girls filed out of the room, Agatha James laid a paper on Winona's desk. It bore the words: 'Kindly report yourself at once in the prefects' room.' Rather mystified, Winona obeyed the summons. She found the prefects assembled in their den, looking dignified and perturbed. 'Winona Woodward,' began Linda Fletcher, 'are you responsible for this post-card?' showing one of the invitations which had been written on Saturday. 'Beatrice Howell brought it to me first thing this morning, by Margaret's advice. Margaret couldn't understand why you had sent it to her.' 'I explained on the card,' replied Winona eagerly. 'It was to try to get up an Old Girls' Hockey Club!' 'And who gave you authority to call such a meeting?' asked Linda icily. 'Why, I thought as Games Captain, , ' began Winona, then she stopped, for the faces of the prefects expressed a righteous wrath that staggered her. 'It was a most unwarrantable liberty!' continued the head girl. 'As Games Captain you are responsible for the school play and for the fixtures, but you're certainly not to take upon yourself a matter of this kind. Why, you're not even a prefect! And no prefect would have dreamed of calling such a meeting on her own account without consulting her colleagues.' 'I, thought, there wasn't time, to ask,' stammered Winona, overcome with confusion. 'As a matter of fact the suggestion had already been placed before the prefects, and it was proposed to form an Old Girls' Guild, which would include several branches, a Hockey Club being among the number. An initial committee meeting is to be held next Thursday. Margaret Howell was perfectly well aware of this, and could not understand why you should have stepped in and called a meeting at the hostel, thus forestalling our arrangements.' 'It's the most abominable cheek I ever heard of!' burst out Agatha James. 'What were you dreaming of?' demanded Grace Olliver. Poor Winona! She suddenly saw her innocent, impulsive act in the light in which it must appear to the prefects. It had never struck her that she was exceeding her authority, and that she ought to have referred the matter to the head of the school. The urgency of getting the club started, so as to enter a Past  v.  Present in her list of fixtures, had been her uppermost thought. She had indeed made a most terrible blunder. The feeling against her was evidently one of general censure. Even Garnet looked grave, and Bessie Kirk was bridling. Linda's manner was coldly official. The stateliness of her speech was more cutting than Agatha's explosive wrath. Winona collapsed utterly, and groveled. 'I'm most fearfully sorry!' she apologized. 'Indeed I'd never have done it if I'd thought about it. I was an utter idiot! I really don't know what possessed me! I just sent off those cards in a hurry. What shall I do? There isn't time to write back to everybody!' 'I think I can send messages to most of the girls, and if any turn up at the hostel this afternoon they must be told.' Linda's tone was slightly mollified. 'I hardly need impress upon you the necessity in future of referring everything to headquarters. No school can be run on the basis of individual enterprise.' Duly chastened, Winona left the prefects' room. She had the further annoyance in the afternoon of explaining the situation to several comers who turned up in answer to her invitation. Notwithstanding this preliminary disturbance, the Old Girls' Guild was started with thirty-five members on the roll. A Hockey Club and a Dramatic Society were formed, both of which promised to have a flourishing existence, and Winona had the satisfaction of fixing a Past  v.  Present match for the following March. The prefects were magnanimous enough to bear her no ill-will, so on the whole she came out of a very unpleasant dilemma much better than she expected. CHAPTER XIV The Hockey Season When the hockey season commenced, Winona got to business. She was wildly anxious to prove an effective Games Captain, and win credit for the school. It would be no easy matter to follow so excellent a predecessor as Kirsty Paterson, but she determined to keep Kirsty's ideals well in mind, and try to live up to them. One change, which Kirsty had suggested, Winona at once carried out. The hockey badge was altered. The new one had the initials S.H.S. embroidered in the school colors on plain dark blue shields, and looked very imposing on the tunics. There was another point upon which Winona was resolved to effect a reform. The field was not in a thoroughly satisfactory condition, and certainly needed attention. The prefects had put the matter before Miss Bishop, who referred it to the Governors. Those august personages, mindful of war economies, decided that for the present it would do well enough, and would not vote the spending of any money upon its improvement. The bad news was received with indignation throughout the school. 'It's too stingy for anything! How can we possibly have decent practice on such a rough old place? I'd like to make them come and try it for themselves, the mean wretches!' protested Bessie Kirk. Winona laughed. A vision of the Governors wildly brandishing hockey sticks flashed across her imagination. She seized her note-book and drew a fancy portrait of the delicious scene: old Councillor Thomson, very wheezy and fat, running furiously; bald-headed Mr. Crabbe performing wonderful acrobatic feats; a worthy J.P. engaged in a tussle with the Town Clerk; and various other of the City Fathers in interesting and exciting attitudes. The masterpiece was passed round for general admiration. The girls sniggered. 'Wish we could show it to them!' said Margaret Kemp. 'Perhaps it might make them realize their responsibilities. It's too sickening of them to grudge keeping the field in order!' 'Look here, it's no use complaining!' said Winona. 'Of course it relieves one's feelings, but it doesn't make any difference to the field. I've got a plan to propose. Let us ask Miss Bishop how much it would cost to hire somebody to do the rolling, and offer to pay for it ourselves. We could get up a Hockey Concert in aid of it.' 'What a frolicsome notion! I'm your man!' 'Wouldn't it be setting a bad precedent?' objected Marjorie Kemp. 'Suppose the Governors stop having the tennis courts cut, and say we may do it ourselves?' 'We'd put that to Miss Bishop first, and make it well understood.' 'It would just make all the difference to the practices to have a roller at work, even once a week,' urged Olave Parry. 'Do ask about it, Win!' Miss Bishop, on being appealed to, considered the suggestion favorably. 'Certainly there's no reason why you shouldn't improve the field, if you wish,' she replied, adding with a smile: 'I'll take care that the tennis courts don't suffer in consequence. It was a prudent thought to mention them. I expect when the war is over, the Governors may be persuaded to take the full expense of the playing field too. I'll get an estimate at once of what the rolling would cost.' Jones, the school janitor, who formerly kept the courts and cricket pitch in order, had gone to the war, and his place was occupied by a rheumatic old fellow who could do little more than carry coke and attend to the heating apparatus. When every able-bodied man seemed fighting or making munitions, it was difficult to find anybody to roll a hockey field, A volunteer was procured at last, however, who undertook the job at the rate of £1 per month, with an extra thirty shillings for putting the field in good order to begin with. Six or seven pounds, therefore, would cover the expenses of the season. Winona, mindful of the terrible offense she had given in connection with the Old Girls' Guild, very wisely took the matter to Linda Fletcher, who called a united meeting of Prefects and Games Committee to discuss the best way of raising the money. 'It will have to be done on a bigger scale than the symposium last year,' said Hilda Langley. 'If I remember rightly, that made exactly £2 13 s.  7 d. , enough for a Form trophy, but not sufficient for this venture.' 'We'd better issue tickets, and sell some of them to parents and friends,' suggested Linda. 'How many will the hall hold?' 'Three hundred at a pinch, if the babes squash up tight.' 'They won't mind doing that in a good cause.' 'The Dramatic Society ought to take an innings, and provide at least half the program.' 'They'll jump at the opportunity. I believe they have something quite prepared, and have been yearning for an audience.' 'Then by all means let them have one.' 'At sixpence a head,' added practical Marjorie; 'we ought easily to be able to sell sixpenny tickets.' Everybody took up the idea with enthusiasm. The difficulty was not so much to find helpers as to decide who was to have the honor of performing. There were many heart-burnings before the program was finally fixed. It was decided that a musical selection should be given first, followed by a piece by the Dramatic students. To cut these to reasonable limits needed all Linda's discretion, tact and firmness. 'You can't have an entertainment beginning at three, and going on till midnight,' she urged, as the various desired items were submitted to her. 'You'd have to hire ambulances to take your exhausted audience home! Very sorry, but we must keep some of the things for a future occasion.' Linda, being wise in her generation, and having an eye to the sale of tickets, insisted that the Lower School should take a share in the performance. 'Who wants to bother to hear the kids?' objected Grace Olliver, who, by the bye, was a member of the 'Dramatic,' and therefore not entirely disinterested. 'If we don't bother with the kids, they mayn't bother to come and bring friends, and we should look silly if we didn't sell all our tickets! Let them do their flag display, and sing their Empire song. That will content them and their mothers, and leaves quite time enough for other people.' Miss Bishop allowed a special Wednesday afternoon to be set aside for the entertainment; the tickets sold briskly, and expectation ran high. All concerned in the program kept their parts a dead secret, but items leaked out, and the wildest rumors were afloat. It was whispered that some of the Governors were to be present, and even that Miss Bishop would perform a sword dance, though not the most callow of juniors really consented to swallow such an astounding piece of information. The uncertainty as to what was in store, however, added largely to the pleasurable anticipation, and though the Dramatic Society rehearsed with locked door, and the keyhole carefully stopped up, juvenile spies, by hoisting one another up to the level of the windows, obtained brief and tantalizing peeps and spread news of gorgeosities in the way of costumes. When the great afternoon arrived, the hall was crammed. The little girls were packed as tightly as sardines. A long line of them squatted on the floor in front of the first row, and others sat on the window sills, the latter positions having been scrambled for with enthusiasm. Every one was at the tip-top of expectation. The concert opened with the inevitable piano solo which seems indispensable for the starting of any entertainment, and during the performance of which latecomers hurry to their seats, programs are sold, and the audience, with a tremendous amount of rustling and whispering, settles itself down to listen. This initiatory ceremony being over, more interesting items followed. The juveniles sang an Empire song, accompanied by a pretty flag drill; it was a taking tune, and as Linda had prophesied was immensely applauded by the visitors, who insisted on an encore. A violin solo came next, and was followed by a charming Russian dance given by two members of Form IV.a. Garnet played a piece on her mandoline, with piano accompaniment. She had suggested a duet for mandoline and guitar, but Winona had had no time to practice her instrument lately, and had begged to be excused. The fact was that Winona had been busy with a special item which she now brought out as a surprise to the school. She had composed some verses in praise of hockey, and set them to one of the tunes in the senior school song-book. The piece was sung by an eleven in full hockey costume, and they waved their hockey-sticks with appropriate actions to the music:     'When autumn returns, and the trees are all bare,       Our blue tunics are off to the field;     No team in excitement with ours can compare,       As our hockey-sticks wildly we wield.         For hockey's the game to play         When autumn has come to stay,         And this is the reason we love the cold season,         For hockey's the game to play.     'Hurrah for goalkeepers, for forwards and halves!       Hurrah for the clash of the sticks!     Hurrah for the rapture of scoring a goal!       (Who minds a few bruises or kicks?)         For hockey's the game to play,         When autumn has come to stay,         And this is the reason we love the cold season,         For hockey's the game to play.     'But a team that is set upon scoring its goal,       And winning a vict'ry or two,     Must see that its field it should carefully roll,       And that's what we're hoping to do!         Oh! hockey's the game to play,         When autumn has come to stay,         Yes, this is the reason we love the cold season,         When hockey's the game we play!     'Hurrah for Form trophies! Hurrah for our badge!       We'll make it an annual rule     To hold a 'Sports' Concert,' to wish all success       To the team of the Seaton High School!         Oh! hockey's the game to play,         And at Seaton we know the way!         Yes, this is the reason we love the cold season,         When hockey's the game we play!' Winona's words would certainly not have passed muster as a literary composition, but their extreme appropriateness to the occasion, combined with the action of the hockey-sticks, completely brought down the house. The applause was thunderous, and the last verse was encored twice over. Undoubtedly it was the hit of the afternoon. For the second part of the performance the Dramatic Society gave an amusing little play, and the concert wound up with a lusty rendering of certain patriotic songs. Winona was highly gratified. Both artistically and financially the entertainment had proved a success. The committee would be well able to bear the expense of keeping the field in order. A gardener had been at work there, and already a marked improvement was noticeable. The Games Captain's enthusiasm was infectious. Under her leadership the girls became wonderfully keen. To Winona the thrill of struggle when a game seemed on the eve of being lost was one of the wildest excitements in life, and the joy when she struck the ball home straight and true the utmost triumph obtainable. During this autumn term she lived for hockey. The crowd of school girls, in thick boots and blue tunics, struggling and shouting in a somewhat muddy field might not be an altogether picturesque sight, but to the Captain it was Marathon and Waterloo combined. No colonel prided himself on a crack regiment more than Winona on her team. Sometimes, of course, a practice was off color; the day might be bleak or drizzly, or players might be penalized for 'sticks,' or grumblers might express their dissatisfaction audibly, but whatever went wrong, Winona emerged cheerful from the fray, remonstrated with 'off-sides' and 'sticks,' and reminded growlers that it is unsporting to murmur. By Kirsty's advice she had sent out challenges to several good clubs in the neighborhood. 'While we were still in our callow infancy I should not have ventured,' wrote Kirsty from Cornwall. 'But one must begin some time to measure one's strength. After the work we did last season, I certainly think you might risk it. Nothing improves a team so much as playing plenty of matches; you see in time you get to know the strokes of everybody at the High, and you can calculate what others will do at certain turns of the game; it's far better for you to meet all sorts and conditions of opponents.' Winona had been afraid it was rather 'cheek' to challenge the 'West Rytonshire Club' or 'Oatlands College,' but she ascertained that both those august bodies had two teams, Number 1 and Number 2, and that while the first only met foes worthy of their steel (or rather sticks!) the second would graciously condescend to play a yet unknown High School. The match with Oatlands College was fixed for December 16th, and Winona looked forward to it with some anxiety. The last practice had not been altogether satisfactory. The day had been wretchedly cold, and everybody had been cross in consequence. The team, though proud of its fixture with so celebrated an opponent, was not very sure of itself. 'I hope to goodness Peggie'll play up!' groaned Marjorie Kemp. 'The way she lost that last goal on Saturday was idiotic.' 'She said she was cold!' commented Gladys Porter, witheringly. 'She wanted to change at half-time. She said her feet were solid ice, and her nose was blue, and it was no fun watching the whole of the game being played right away at the other end of the field.' 'Most unsporting!' moralized Marjorie. 'Besides, when she got her chance, she hit the air! It will be very humiliating if the Oatlands team walk over us!' 'Oh, don't be a Jeremiah! We're not beaten yet! If anybody can pull us through, our Captain will!' 'Winona's a jewel!' agreed Marjorie. 'And yet the best captain in the world can't make up for an only moderately good team. I feel my own deficiencies!' Practically the whole of the High School assembled as spectators on the great day of the match. Things were very different now from the old times when a mere handful collected to cheer the Seaton team. Mistresses and girls were alike keen, and most desirous of witnessing the combat. They followed the game breathlesly. 'Oatlands isn't worth a toss!' commented Garnet exultantly. 'Don't make too sure!' replied Linda, looking with apprehension as the red jerseys of their rivals massed round the ball. A familiar figure dashed forward, a hockey stick struck, and the ball swept out to safety. Linda heaved a long sigh of relief. 'Winona is just A1,' she murmured. 'Hello! Good gracious! what's that idiot doing?' For Ellinor Cooper, whose arm was the strongest in the school, wielding her hockey stick with all her force, had hit Winona across the shin. Instantly there was a commotion. Winona, white with the agony of the blow, leaned hard against Bessie Kirk, and clenched her fists to avoid crying out. 'Are you hurt?' 'What's happened?' 'You've had a nasty knock!' There was quite a crowd round Winona, and a chorus of sympathy. 'Put in a substitute!' urged Bessie. 'You're not fit to go on!' 'No, no! I'm better now,' panted their captain, with a wan little smile. 'I'll manage, thanks! Yes, really! Please don't worry yourselves about me!' The game recommenced and Winona, with a supreme effort, continued to play. The pain was still acute, but she realized that on her presence or absence depended victory or defeat. Without her, the courage of the team would collapse. How she lived through the time she never knew. Inspired by the heroic example of their captain, the girls were playing for all they were worth. The score, which had been against them, was now even. Time was almost up. Winona set her teeth. The ball seemed a kind of star which she was following, Following anyhow. As the French say, she 'did her possible.' The ball went spinning. Next minute she was leaning against a goal-post, trembling with the violence of her effort, while the High School hoorayed itself hoarse in the joy of the hard-won victory. 'I say, old girl, were you really hurt?' asked Bessie anxiously. 'You're looking the color of chalk!' 'Never mind, it's over now! Yes, I am hurt. Give me your arm, and I'll go back to the hostel.' 'You're an absolute Joan of Arc to-day!' purred Bessie. Winona, with a barked shin and bad bruises, limped for more than a week, but she was the heroine of the school. 'I can't think how you ran, after that awful whack Ellinor Cooper gave you,' sympathized Marjorie. 'It was easier to run then than after my leg grew stiff,' laughed Winona. 'I suppose it's the excitement that keeps one up. Don't make such a fuss, we've all had hard knocks in our time. Agnes Smith got a black eye last spring!' As the result of her wounds in the hockey field Winona made friends with Miss Kelly. The latter was most prompt in applying lanoline and bandages, and proved so kind in bringing Winona her breakfast in bed, and making her rest on the sofa during preparation, that a funny little sort of intimacy sprang up between them. 'She's fussy on the surface, but nice when you know her,' confided Winona to Garnet. 'If I'd been staying at the hostel, I expect we should have got on capitally next term!' CHAPTER XV Winona Turns Chauffeur After the Christmas holidays Winona returned to Abbey Close. Miss Beach was installed once more in her own home, though under strict orders from the doctor not to over-exert herself. During her stay at Harrogate she had bought a small two-seater car, and had learnt to drive it. She kept it at a garage in the town, and used it almost every day. It was invaluable to her as a means of getting about. She was anxious not to relinquish all her work in Seaton, but she could not now bear the fatigue of walking. In her car distance was no obstacle, and she could continue her inspection of boarded-out workhouse children, attend babies' clinics in country villages beyond the city area, visit the wives of soldiers and sailors, regulate the orphanage, and superintend the Tipperary Club. Miss Beach's energetic temperament made her miserable unless fully occupied, so, the doctor having forbidden her former strenuous round of duties, she adopted the car as a compromise, assuring him that she would limit her list to a few of her pet schemes only. It was probably her wisest course. It is very hard for elderly people to be laid on the shelf, and to feel that their services are set aside. Miss Beach had lived so entirely in her various philanthropic occupations, that to give everything up would have been a severe mental shock. As it was, she managed to obey medical orders, and at the same time, to a certain extent, keep her old place in the work of the city. As the days became longer and lighter, she sometimes took her great-niece with her in the car. Winona had really very little time out of school hours; her duties as Games Captain were paramount, and hockey practices and matches absorbed most of her holiday afternoons. When she had an occasional free hour, however, it was an immense treat to go motoring. She loved the feeling of spinning along through the country lanes. It was delightful to see new places and fresh roads. Seaton was in the midst of a beautiful district, and there were charming villages, woods, and lovely views of scenery within easy distance. One Saturday, when for a wonder there was no event at school, Miss Beach suddenly suggested that they should start in the car, take a luncheon basket with them, and explore some of the country in the neighborhood. It was a glorious spring morning, with a clear pale blue sky, and a touch of warmth in the sunshine that set winter to flight, and brought the buds out on the trees. On such a day the human sap, too, seems to rise, there is an exhilaration, physical and spiritual, when we long to run or to sing for the sheer vital joy of living, when our troubles don't seem to matter, and the future looks rosy, and for the moment we feel transferred to the golden age of the poets, when the world was young, and Pan played his pipes in the meadows among the asphodels. Winona, at any rate, was in an ecstatic frame of mind, and though Aunt Harriet did not openly express her enthusiasm, the mere fact of her suggesting such an outing proved that the spring had called her, and that she was ready to go out and worship at Nature's shrine. Do not imagine for a moment that Miss Beach, whatever her feelings, allowed any romantic element to appear on the surface. She fussed over the car, measured the amount of petrol left in the tank, debated whether she had better go to the garage for an extra can in case of emergencies, called out the cook to dust the seat, sent the housemaid flying to the attic for an air-cushion, inspected the lunch basket, gave half-a-dozen directions for things to be done in her absence, wrote last messages on a slate for people who might possibly call on business, scolded Winona for putting on her thin coat, and sent her to fetch her thick one and a rug for her knees, and finally, after a very breathless ten minutes got under way, and started forth. They drove slowly through the town traffic, but soon they had left streets behind, and were spinning along the high road in the direction of Wickborough. Long as she had lived at Seaton, Miss Beach had never seen Wickborough Castle, and to-day she was determined to pay it a visit. It was a very ancient place, built originally by King Canute, in the days when red war was waged between Saxon and Norseman. Little of the old Danish tower remained, but successive generations had erected keep and turret, bastion and guard house, crumbling now indeed into ruins, but picturesque in their decay, and full of historical associations. Here proud Queen Margaret, hard pressed by her enemies, had found a timely shelter for herself and her little son, till an escort could convey her to a spot of greater safety; here Richard II. had pursued sweet unwilling Anne of Warwick, and forced her to accept his hated suit; Princess Mary had passed a part of her unhappy childhood within its walls, and Anne Boleyn's merry laugh had rung out there. The situation of the Castle was magnificent. It stood on the summit of a wooded cliff which ran sheer into the river, and commanded a splendid prospect of the country round, and a bird's-eye view of the little town that clustered at the foot of the crag. 'It's like an eagle's nest!' commented Winona, as leaving the car at the bottom of the hill they climbed on foot up the zigzag pathway to the keep. 'It must have been a regular robber-baron's stronghold in the Middle Ages!' Miss Beach had bought a guide-book, and rejecting the services of a persistent little girl who was anxious to point out the various spots of interest, with an eye to a tip, they strolled about, trying to reconstruct a fancy portrait of the place for themselves. Canute's tower was still left, a squat solid piece of masonry, with enormously thick walls and tiny lancet windows. It was rather dark, but as it was the only portion remaining intact, it was used as a museum, and various curiosities were preserved there. The great fire-place held a spit for roasting an ox whole, and had a poker five feet long; stone cannon-balls were piled up on the floor, and on the walls hung a medieval armory of helmets, gorgelets, breast-plates, coats of mail, shields and swords, daggers and lances. A special feature of the museum was a wax-work figure of a knight clad in full armor which gave an excellent idea of what Sir Bevis of Wickborough must have looked like somewhere about the year 1217. Another figure, dressed in rich velvet and fur, with flowered silk kirtle, represented his wife Dame Philippa, in the act of offering him a silver goblet of wine, while a hound stood with its head pressed to her hand. The group was so natural that it was almost startling, and took the spectator back as nothing else could have done to the ancient medieval days which it pictured. A small stair in the corner of the tower led down to a dungeon, where, lying among the straw, was an equally impressive wax-work figure of a prisoner, wretched, unkempt, and bound hand and foot with chains. A pitcher of water lay by his side, and a stuffed rat peering from the straw added a further touch of realism. Winona shuddered. It was a ghastly sight, and she was thankful to run up the stairs and go from the keep out into the spring sunshine. She had always had a romantic admiration for the Middle Ages, but this aspect of thirteenth-century life did not commend itself to her. 'They were bad old times, after all!' she decided, and came to the conclusion that the twentieth century, even with its horrible war, was a more humane period to live in. At the foot of the crag, close by the river, lay the remains of the old Priory Church, an ivy-covered fabric, whose broken chancel still gave a shelter to the battered tombs of the knights who had lived in the Castle above. Sir Bevis and Dame Philippa lay here in marble, their features calm and rigid, their hands folded in prayer, less human indeed, but infinitely grander than in their wax effigies of the tower. Seven centuries of sunshine and storm had passed over their heads, and castle and church were alike in ruins.     'Their bones are dust,     Their good swords rust,     Their souls are with the Saints, we trust,' thought Winona, as she took a photograph of the quiet scene. It was deeply interesting, but on this glorious lovely spring day it seemed a little too sad. With all the birds singing, and the hedges in bud, and the daisies showing white stars among the grass, she wanted to live in the present, and not in the past. And yet, if we think about it rightly, the past is never really sad. Those who lived before us accomplished their work, and have passed onwards, a part of the world scheme, to, we doubt not, fuller and worthier work beyond. We, still in the preparatory class of God's great school, cannot yet grasp the higher forms, but those who have been moved up surely smile at our want of comprehension, and look back on this earth as the College undergraduate remembers his kindergarten; for the spiritual evolution goes ever on, working always Godwards, and when the human dross falls away, the imperfect and the partial will be merged into the perfect and the eternal. The broken eggshells may lie in the old nest, but the fledged larks are singing in the blue of the sky. From the little town of Wickborough they drove along the old Roman road towards Danestone. Part of their way lay across Wickland Heath, and here, as it was now past mid-day, Miss Beach suggested that they should stop and take their lunch. It was a most glorious spot for a picnic. They were at the top of a tableland, and before them spread the Common, a brown sea of last year's heather and bilberry, with gorse bushes flaming here and there like golden fires. A sparrow-hawk, more majestic than any aëroplane, sailed serenely overhead, and a pair of whinchats, perturbed by his vicinity, flew with a sharp twitter over the low stone wall, and sought cover among the brambles. Beyond stretched the Roman road, broad and straight, a landmark for miles. Cities and civilization were far away, and they were alone with the moor and the peaty little brook, and the birds and the sun and the fresh spring wind. The joyous influence was irresistible; even Miss Beach dropped ten years' burden of cares, and waxed almost light-hearted. Winona had seldom seen her aunt in such a mood, and she seized the opportunity as a favorable moment to proffer a request which she had often longed, but had never hitherto dared, to make. It was no less a suggestion than that she might be allowed to try to drive the car. She put it in tentative fashion, fully expecting a refusal, but Aunt Harriet received the idea quite graciously. 'There's no reason why you shouldn't. The road's wide and straight, and not a vehicle in sight; you couldn't have a better place to learn on in the whole of the kingdom. Mind you do exactly what I tell you, that's all!' Winona's face was shining. Ever since she had first seen the pretty little two-seater it had been her secret ambition to work its steering wheel for herself. She packed up the lunch basket in a hurry, for fear her aunt might repent. But Miss Beach seldom went back on her word, and was quite disposed and ready to act motor instructress. She began by explaining very carefully the various levers, and how to start. 'One golden rule,' she urged, 'is to take care the lever is at neutral before you begin, or the car will jump on you. Many motorists have had nasty accidents by omitting that most necessary precaution. Next you must see that the ignition is pushed back, or you'll get a back-fire in starting, and break your wrist. It must be just at this notch, do you see? Now you may swing round the handle.' The engine began to work, and Winona took her place in the driver's seat. Miss Beach, sitting by her side, showed her how to put the low gear in, then to put in the clutch. The car started off under Winona's guidance. She gripped the steering wheel tightly, turning it to right or left at first according to her aunt's directions, but soon from instinctive comprehension. It was something like guiding a gigantic bicycle; she could not yet exactly estimate the amount of turn required, but she felt that it would come to her with practice. There was an immense exhilaration in feeling the car under her control. For a beginner, she really kept very steadily in the middle of the road; occasionally Aunt Harriet made a snatch at the wheel, but that was seldom necessary. They were going very slowly, only about ten miles an hour, but even that seemed a tolerable speed to a novice. The road was curving now, and Winona must steer round a corner; it was easier than she had expected, and her instructress ejaculated 'Good!' The sense of balance was beginning to come to her. Such a tiny movement of the wheel sent the car to right or left; at first she had jerked it clumsily, now she could reckon the proportion with greater nicety. Was that something coming in the distance? 'Sound your hooter!' shouted Aunt Harriet quickly, as a motor cycle hove in sight. In rather a panic, Winona squeezed the india-rubber bulb, making the car lurch as she took her hand momentarily from the wheel. 'Keep well to the left!' commanded Miss Beach, and Winona, with her heart in her mouth, contrived to obey, and passed her first vehicle successfully. She heaved a sigh of relief when it had whizzed by, and the road was once more clear. Naturally, however, she could not expect to keep a thoroughfare all to herself. Further on, she overtook a farmer's cart full of little squealing pigs. As it occupied the exact center of the road she hooted (with great confidence this time), and, when it had swung to the left, she rounded it successfully on the right. A furniture van looked a terrible obstacle, but she passed it without assistance, and began to wax quite courageous. Three motor cars in succession tearing along one after another, and sounding ear-splitting electric hooters, left her nerves rather rocky. When houses and chimneys appeared in sight Miss Beach told her to stop. 'I daren't let a learner drive through a village. There are always too many children and dogs about the street. Change places with me now, and you shall try again when we come to a quiet road.' Rather thankful not to have to venture her 'prentice skill in the narrow winding street, Winona gave the wheel into her aunt's more experienced hands. It was only  pro tem. , however, for when they were once more in the open country Miss Beach continued the lesson, making her start and stop several times just for practice. 'I believe you know the routine now,' she said. 'It's the motorist's first catechism. Remember those cardinal rules, and you can't go so far wrong.' 'Do experienced people ever forget them?' asked Winona. 'Sometimes, when they grow careless. Mr. Forster sprained his wrist the other day with a back-fire, which he ought to have avoided, and I heard of a horrible accident in Paris, when a chauffeur started his car with the clutch in gear, with the consequence that it dashed over a bridge into the Seine, and the occupants, a lady and two little children, were drowned before his eyes. There's no need to be nervous if you take proper care, but cars are not playthings to be trifled with.' They had reached a part of the country which Miss Beach had known as a child. She had not visited it since, and was interested to see again spots which had once been familiar. 'I remember the river perfectly,' she said. 'And that hill, with the wood where we used to get blackberries in the autumn. I wonder if the wild daffodils still grow in Chipden Marsh! It's fifty years since I gathered them! Shall we go and see? They ought just to be out now, and it's really not late yet.' Winona was only too delighted to prolong the day's outing, and would not have demurred if Aunt Harriet had proposed returning home by moonlight. She caught eagerly at the suggestion of finding daffodils. Though half-a-century had sped by Miss Beach remembered the way, and drove through many by-lanes to a tract of low-lying pasture land that bordered the river. She had not forgotten the stile, which still remained as of yore, so leaving the car in the road they walked down the fields. At first they were disappointed, but further on, beside the river, the Marsh might well have been called 'Daffodil Meadow.' Everywhere the lovely little wild Lent lilies were showing their golden trumpets in such profusion among the grass that the scene resembled Botticelli's famous picture of spring. Miss Beach said little, but her eyes shone with reminiscences. Winona was in ecstasies, and ran about picking till her bunch was almost too big to hold. The slanting afternoon sunlight fell on the water with a glinting, glistening sheen; the sallows overhanging the banks were yellow with pollen, the young pushing arum shoots and river herbs wore their tender early spring hue; the scene was an idyll in green and gold. They were loath to leave, but time was passing, so, very reluctantly, they walked up the fields again to rejoin the car. They had stowed their daffodils in the lunch basket, and Winona was peeping over the hedge to take a last look at the river, when an exclamation behind her made her turn round. Miss Beach was leaning heavily against the car, her face was ashen gray, her lips were white and drawn. She looked ready to faint. Winona flew to her in a panic. 'What is it, Aunt Harriet? Are you ill? Get into the car and sit down. Let me help you!' Miss Beach sank on to the seat, and sat with half-closed eyes, moaning feebly. Winona was terribly alarmed. She had seen Aunt Harriet before with one of her bad heart attacks, and knew that restoratives ought to be given. In this lonely spot, with no help at hand, what was to be done? Suppose her aunt were to faint, die, even, before aid could be rendered? For a moment Winona shook like a leaf. Then, with a rush, her presence of mind returned. There was only one possible course, she herself must start the car, and drive to within reach of civilization. It would need courage! It was one thing to drive with an experienced instructor at her elbow to shout necessary directions, but quite another to manage alone, with Aunt Harriet half unconscious beside her. Suppose she were to forget part of her motorists' catechism, and make some horrible, fatal mistake! Well, it must be ventured, all the same! Every minute's delay was important. With a nervous shiver she forced herself to action. She looked first that the clutch was out of gear, and that the ignition was pushed back, then swung round the handle to start the engine. It had cooled while they were picking daffodils, and she was obliged to repeat the process four times ere the welcome whirring answered her efforts. She sprang to her seat, took off the brake, and put in the low gear. Then she put the clutch in with her foot. But alas! in her tremor and hurry she had done it too suddenly, and stopped the engine! She could have cried with annoyance at her stupidity. There was nothing for it but to put the lever again at neutral, put on the brake, and climb out to re-swing the handle. This time the engine, being warm, was more amiable and condescended to start easily. Winona leaped into the car, adjusted her levers, put in her clutch more gradually, and the car glided slowly away. With a feeling of desperation she gripped the steering wheel. The lane was narrow and twisting, and not too smooth. Suppose she were to meet a farm cart, could she possibly pass it in safety? She had a feeling that she would run into any vehicle that might approach her. So far the lane was empty, but at any moment an obstacle might arise. What was that? There was a sound of baa-ing, and round a corner ran a flock of sheep, urged on by a boy and a collie dog. Here was the first human being she had seen, and for a second she thought of stopping to ask for help. But what could a stupid-looking young boy do for her? No, it were better far to push on. She managed to sound the hooter, and with a supreme effort kept in the middle of the lane, while the sheep scattered to right and left. She dared not go any slower, for fear of stopping her engine, but she expected every instant to feel a bump, and find that she had run over one of the flock. The collie did his duty, however, and in a whirl of barking, shouting, and baa-ing she steered safely through the danger. She looked anxiously at every turning, for fear she might miss her way. Her object was to regain the main road, where she might find some passing motorist, and implore help. Yes, there was the sign-post where Aunt Harriet had halted, she must keep to the left by that ruined cottage, she remembered noticing its broken roof as they had passed it. How interminably long the lanes were! They had seemed far shorter when Aunt Harriet was driving! Oh! thank goodness, there was the big oak tree, it could not be far now. A few minutes more and Winona had reached the sign-post, and swung round the corner into the Crowland Road. She felt as if her nerves would not stand very much more. Would help never come? A distant hooting behind her made her heart leap. She stopped the car beside the hedge, and standing up, waved her handkerchief as a signal of distress. A splendid Daimler came into sight. Would the chauffeur notice and understand her plight? She shrieked in desperation as it whizzed past. Oh! It was stopping! A gentleman got out, and walked quickly back towards her. She jumped down, and ran to meet him. 'Can I be of any assistance?' he asked politely. 'Oh, please! My aunt is very ill, and I don't know how to drive properly yet. How am I going to get back to Seaton?' blurted out Winona, on the verge of tears. She never forgot how kind the stranger was. With the aid of his chauffeur he lifted poor Aunt Harriet into his own car, and told Winona to take her place beside her. 'Now tell me exactly where you want to go,' he said, 'and I'll run you straight home as fast as I can. My man shall follow with your car. You can manage this little two-seater, Jones?' 'Yes, Sir,' grinned the chauffeur, inspecting the levers. The stranger made his big Daimler fly. Winona never knew by how much he exceeded the speed limit, but it seemed to her that they must be spinning along at the rate of nearly fifty miles an hour. Aunt Harriet had recovered a little, though she still moaned at intervals. The hedges seemed to whirl past them, they went hooting through villages, and whizzed over a common. At last the familiar spires and towers of Seaton appeared in the distance. Their good Samaritan drove them to their own door, helped Miss Beach into the house, and volunteered to take a message to the doctor, then, evading Winona's thanks, he sprang into his car, and started away. The chauffeur arrived later with Miss Beach's car, and considerately offered to run it round to the garage. Aunt Harriet was laid up for several days after this episode, and Dr. Sidwell forbade any long expeditions in the immediate future. He encouraged the idea of Winona learning to drive. 'You could be of the greatest help in taking your aunt about,' he said to her. 'You must have a capital notion of it, or you couldn't have brought the car three miles entirely on your own. But of course you'll need practice before you can be trusted to mix in traffic. You'll have to apply for a license, remember. You'll be getting into trouble if you drive without!' Winona looked back upon that outing as a most memorable occasion. She hoped to try her skill again as soon as opportunity offered. The charm of the wheel was alluring. She wished she knew the name of the stranger who had rendered such invaluable assistance. But that she never learnt. [Illustration: 'WINONA STOPPED THE CAR BESIDE THE HEDGE, AND, STANDING UP, WAVED HER HANDKERCHIEF AS A SIGNAL OF DISTRESS'] CHAPTER XVI The Athletic Display The Easter term was passing quickly away. It had been a strenuous but nevertheless successful season. Out of nine hockey matches the team had lost only three, not a bad record for a school that was still in the infancy of its Games reputation. The Old Girls' Guild had got up its eleven, and had practiced with enthusiasm under the captaincy of Kirsty Paterson. A most exciting Past  versus  Present match had been played, resulting in a narrow victory for the school. Winona felt prouder of this success than of any other triumph the team had scored, for Kirsty had congratulated her afterwards, and praise from her former captain was very sweet. It had been the last match of the season, so it made a satisfactory finish to her work. She felt quite sentimental as she put by her hockey-stick. Next season there would be a fresh captain, and she would have left the High School! She wished she were staying another year, but her scholarship would expire at the end of July. She could hardly believe that she had been nearly two years at the school, and that only one term more remained to her. Well, it would be the summer term, which was the pleasantest of all, and though hockey was over, she had the cricket season before her. The Seaton High should score at the wicket if it were in her power to coach a successful team. Towards the end of March Winona had an interlude which for the time took her thoughts even from the omnipresent topic of sports. Percy, who had been in training with his regiment at Duncastle, was ordered to the Front. He was allowed thirty-six hours' leave, and came home for a Sunday. Winona spent that week-end at Highfield, and the memory of it always remained a very precious one. Percy in his khaki seemed much changed, and though she only had him for a few minutes quite to herself, she felt that the old tie between them had strengthened. Her letters to him in future would be different. During the last year they had both slacked a little in their correspondence, each perhaps unconsciously feeling that the other's standpoint was changing; now they had met again on a new basis, and realized once more a common bond of sympathy. Percy, absorbed in describing his new life, scarcely mentioned Aunt Harriet. The episode of the burning of the paper seemed to have faded from his memory, or he had conveniently buried it in oblivion. Winona had never forgotten it. It remained still the one shadow in her career at Seaton. Now especially, since Miss Beach's recent ill-health, the secret weighed heavily upon her. She felt her aunt ought to know that the will was destroyed, so that she might take the opportunity of making another. More than once she tried indirectly to refer to the subject, but it was a tender topic, and at the least hint Miss Beach's face would stiffen and her voice harden; the old barrier between them would rise up again wider than ever, and impossible to be spanned. Winona would have been glad to do much for her aunt, but Miss Beach did not care to be treated as an invalid. Like many energetic people, she refused to acknowledge that she was ill, and the acceptance of little services seemed to her a confession of her own weakness. It is rather hard to have your kindly meant efforts repulsed, so Winona, finding that her offers of sympathy met with no response, drew back into her shell, and the two continued to live as before, on terms of friendship but never of intimacy. After almost two years spent in the same house Winona knew her aunt little better than on the day of her arrival. They had certain common grounds for conversation, but their mutual reserve was maintained, and as regarded each other's real thoughts they remained 'strangers yet.' Miss Beach, however, took an interest in Winona's doings at school. She read her monthly reports, and scolded her if her work had fallen below standard. She expressed a guarded pleasure over successful matches, but rubbed in the moral that games must not usurp her attention to the detriment of her form subjects. 'You came here to learn something more than hockey!' she would remind Winona. 'It's a splendid exercise, but I'm afraid it won't prove a career! I should like to see a better record for Latin and Chemistry; they might very well have more attention!' Winona had tried to persuade her aunt to come and watch one of the matches, but Miss Beach had always found some engagement; she was concerned in so many of the city's activities that her time was generally carefully mapped out weeks beforehand. She consented, however, to accept Miss Bishop's invitation to the Gymnasium Display, which was to be given at the High School at the close of the Easter term. This was a very important occasion in the estimation of the girls. It was their first athletic show since the advent of Miss Barbour, the Swedish drill mistress. Governors and parents were to be present, and the excellence of the performance must justify the large amount which had been spent upon gymnastic apparatus during the past year. For two whole terms Miss Barbour had been teaching and training her classes with a view to this exhibition, and woe betide any unlucky wight whose nerves, memory or muscles should fail her at the critical moment! A further impetus was given to individual effort by the offer, on the part of one of the Governors, of four medals for competition, to be awarded respectively to the best candidates in four classes, Seniors over 16, Intermediates from 13 to 16, Juniors from 10 to 13, and Preparatories under 10. It was felt throughout the school that the offer was munificent. The Governors had been stingy over the matter of the hockey field, and had been reviled accordingly, but Councillor Jackson was retrieving the character of the Board by this action, and the girls reversed their opinion in his favor. They hoped that other Governors, warmed by his example, might open their hearts in silver medals or book prizes for future occasions. 'He's a dear old trump to think of it!' said Winona. 'You drew a picture of him floundering in the mud at hockey!' twinkled Garnet. 'Well, I forgive him now, and I'll draw another of him standing on the platform, all beaming with benevolence, and distributing medals broadcast. Look here, Bessie Kirk, you needn't be congratulating yourself beforehand with such a patently self-satisfied smirk, because  I'm  going to win the Senior Medal.' 'No, you're not, my child! Take it patiently, and compose your mind. The medal's coming this way!' 'How about me?' put in Marjorie Kemp. 'You'll do well, but you're not a champion! You're too fat, Jumbo, and that's the fact. You're all right when it's a question of brute strength, but when agility matters, those superfluous pounds of flesh of yours are an impediment. I'd back Joyce sooner than you; she's as light as a feather!' Hearing herself commended, Joyce fluttered up to the group, smiling. 'I did four feet six, yesterday,' she announced, 'and I'd have cleared four feet seven, I believe, only I had to stop. It's always my luck!' 'Why had you to stop?' 'My back ached!' Instant apprehension overspread the faces of her friends. 'Joyce Newton!' exclaimed Winona, 'you're never going to get small-pox again, and stop the athletic display?' 'You don't feel sick, or head-achy, or sore-throaty, do you?' implored Bessie. 'For goodness sake stand away, if you're infectious! I don't want to be another contact case!' 'What pigs you are!' said Joyce plaintively, 'One can't catch small-pox twice!' 'But you might be going to get scarlet fever, or measles, or even influenza!' 'Stop ragging! Mayn't I have a back-ache if I want? It's my own back!' 'Have as many back-aches as you choose, my hearty, but don't disseminate germs! If the athletic display doesn't come off, I'll break my heart, and you can write an epitaph over me:     'Here lies one who young in years,     Left this mortal vale of tears;     Cruel fate hath knocked her down,     Tom from her the laurel crown,     To win the gym display she sighed,     But as she might not jump, she died!' 'Look here!' said Marjorie. 'I suppose the medal lies fairly well between us four. I vote that we make a compact, whoever wins treats the other three to ices! It would be some compensation for losing!' 'Good for you, Jumbo! I'm game!' agreed Bessie. 'If you'll undertake they'll be strawberry ices!' stipulated Winona. 'I mayn't eat ices, they disagree with me!' wailed Joyce, 'but if you'll make it chocolates.' 'Done! I won't forget. Ices for Bessie and Winona, and a packet of Cadbury's for Joyce. I'll go and be ordering them!' chirruped Marjorie, dancing away. 'Cheek! Don't make so sure.' 'It's  my  medal, so be getting your handkerchiefs ready,' maintained Winona. Though Winona, just for the fun of teasing her friends, had pretended to appropriate the prize, she had really no anticipation of winning. She was fairly good at gymnasium work, but could not be considered a champion. She knew her success or failure would depend very much on luck. If she happened to feel in the right mood she might achieve something, but it was an even chance that at the critical moment her courage might fail her. In a match she was generally swept away by the intense feeling of cooperation, the knowledge that all her team were striving for a common cause buoyed her up, but in a competition where each was for herself, the element of nervousness would have greater scope. When she thought about it, she felt that she would probably be shaking with fright. The great day came at last. The Gymnasium was decorated with flags in honor of the occasion, and pots of palms were placed upon the platform where the Governors and a few of the most distinguished visitors were accommodated with seats. Winona, marching in to take part in the senior drill, gave one glance round the building, and grasped the fact that Aunt Harriet was sitting on the platform next to Councillor Jackson, and only a few places away from the expert who was to act as judge. She was chatting affably with her august companions. Think of chatting with a Governor! Winona felt that it was some credit to have such a relation! She had not always been very sure how much she valued Aunt Harriet's opinion, but this afternoon she longed to shine before her. Yet the very wish to do so made her nervous. She glanced at her companions. Bessie was looking stolidity itself, Marjorie's usually high color had reached peony point, Joyce was palpably in the throes of stage fright. All were soon marching and countermarching, swinging Indian clubs, and performing the intricate maneuvers of Swedish drill. Fortunately they had practiced well, and it went without a hitch. They breathed more freely as they retired to the ante-room to make way for the babies who were to do skipping exercises to music. 'It's more awful to show off before Governors than I expected!' sighed Joyce. 'I'm just shivering!' 'What'll you be at the rings, then?' asked Bessie. 'Silence!' urged Miss Lever, who was in charge of the ante-room. The strains of 'Little Grey Home in the West' and the regular thud of small feet were wafted from the gymnasium. 'Don't you wish you were a kid again?' whispered Joyce. 'No, I don't!' retorted Bessie, so imprudently loud that Miss Lever glared at her. 'It's horrid having to stay in here, where one can't see!' murmured Marjorie under her breath. They knew by the music, however, what was taking place. The juniors were doing wand exercises, the intermediates followed with clubs. 'Our turn again soon,' whispered Winona. Olave Parry, from a vantage post near the door, could see into the gymnasium, and report progress. Her items of news passed in whispers down the ranks. The babies had skipped like a row of cherubs, and the Governors were wreathed in smiles. Kitty Carter had dropped one of her clubs, and it nearly hit a visitor on the head, but fortunately missed her by half an inch. Laura Marshall was performing prodigies on the horizontal ladder, she undoubtedly had a chance for a medal. Bursts of applause from the audience punctuated the performance. Olave continued her report, which Miss Lever, who took occasional excursions into the gymnasium, verified from time to time. The juniors were competing now. Natalie Powers was about to do the ring exercises. It was a swing and a pull-up in front, and she managed that neatly, but when it came to the swing and the turn, she lost her nerve, turned too soon and spun round helplessly in the air until Miss Barbour hurried to her aid. Natalie was done for, without doubt! It was a good thing she had not fallen and hurt herself. Her rivals were rope-climbing. Madge Collins had reached the top in six seconds, and was sliding down again, to the accompaniment of loud clapping. Lennie Roberts had beaten her, for she had performed the same feat in exactly five seconds. The juniors were in a ferment of excitement. The interest of the audience had waxed to enthusiasm point. 'Seniors!' announced Miss Lever briefly, and the row of waiting figures in the ante-room fell into line, and marched into the gymnasium for the special trials. The Swedish drill exercises, where all worked together, had not seemed half so formidable. A well practiced part is not easily forgotten even by a nervous girl, if it must be done in company with others. It was another matter, however, to perform single athletic feats before a big audience. For a moment Winona turned almost dizzy with fright. The big room seemed full of eyes, every one of which would be watching her when it came to her turn. She looked round with the feeling of a martyr in the arena, and for a moment met the calm steady gaze of Miss Beach. Winona said afterwards that Aunt Harriet must have mesmerized her, for in that second of recognition she felt a sudden rush of courage. The thrill of the contest took possession of her, and every nerve and muscle, every atom of her brain, was alert to do its best. She would let Aunt Harriet see that, though she might fail sometimes in form work, she could hold her own at gymnastics. Contestants climbed, traveled on rings, and vaulted the horse. Winona seemed to herself as easy and agile as she had ever been. She had a possible chance of winning, and her heart exulted. Then came the ladders. Up and up she went, holding herself now by her hands and now by her feet swinging for her hold. She had thought she was light, but now she suddenly realized how heavy she was! She summoned every bit of strength as she went down the ladder. From one contest to another she passed, doing her best. Last of all came the rings. Winona swung out, grasped the next ring, and so on down the line. Oh, how many there were! She had never before realized what it meant to weigh 7 st. 10 lbs. She held her breath as she reached for the next ring, but it slipped from her fingers. Only for a second, however, for she caught it on the next swing, and a moment later was waiting at the end. Bessie was just starting. Down the line she traveled, not so gracefully, perhaps, as Winona, but catching her ring on every swing. Joyce followed, but mid-way her courage deserted her, and she failed utterly. Marjorie came next. She was doing well surely! She was nearly through, reached for the last ring, missed it, and fell! There was an instant murmur of consternation from the audience. Was she injured? She sprang up unhurt, however, though deeply humiliated. Thrilling in every nerve, Winona started back. Refreshed by her little rest, she swung lightly, steadily and unfalteringly, never missing a ring till she came to the end. She was almost too occupied to notice the cheers. Bessie reached mid-way, then missed a ring, caught it on the second swing, missed another, and reached for it three times before she caught it and finished her course. The girls had been too much excited for comparisons. They scarcely guessed how their averages would stand. Winona had a general impression that Bessie had scored at vaulting, and Marjorie had undoubtedly cleared the rope at four feet eight. Her own performances seemed lost in a haze; she had noticed the judge jot down something, but she felt incapable of reckoning her chances. The judge was conferring with Miss Bishop at the back of the platform, and while the room waited for their decision the school marched, singing an Empire song. At last the judge stepped to the front of the platform. The singing ceased. Winona's heart beat suffocatingly. 'I have great pleasure in giving the results,' announced the judge. 'Preparatory prize, Elaine Jennings; Junior prize, Lennie Roberts; Intermediate prize, Laura Marshall; Senior prize, Winona Woodward.' The applause was ringing out lustily. Bessie, Marjorie and Joyce were pressing congratulations upon her. Miss Bishop (actually the Head!) was looking at her and smiling approval. Miss Lever was telling her to walk forward. In a delirious whirl, Winona climbed the steps on the platform. As Councillor Jackson pinned the medal on to her tunic, a storm of clapping and cheers rose from the school. Their Games Captain was popular, and everybody felt it right and fitting that this afternoon she should have proved herself the athletic champion. 'Don't forget the ices!' whispered Bessie, as Winona rejoined Marjorie and Joyce. 'We'll stop at the café on the way home, and you shall each choose what you like!' declared Winona, with spendthrift liberality. CHAPTER XVII Back to the Land Easter fell late, so Winona spent the lovely early part of May at her own home. After so many weeks of town it was delightful to be once more in the country. She worked with enthusiasm in the garden, mowed the lawn, and with Letty and Mamie's help began to put up an arbor, over which she hoped to persuade a crimson rambler to ramble successfully. In the house she tried her hand at scones and cakes, entirely to the children's satisfaction, if not altogether to her own; she enjoyed experiments in cooking, for she had longed to join the Domestic Science class at school, and had felt aggrieved when Miss Bishop decided that her time-table was full enough without it. She found her mother looking delicate and worried. Poor Mrs. Woodward's health had not improved during the last two years; she was nervous, anxious about Percy, and inclined to be fretful and tearful. The increased income-tax and the added cost of living made her constantly full of financial cares; she was not a very good manager, and the thought of the future oppressed her. 'I don't know what's to be done with you, Winona, when you leave school!' she remarked plaintively one evening. 'I feel that you ought to go in for something, but I'm sure I don't know what! I'd hoped you were going to turn out clever, and win a scholarship for College, and get a good post as a teacher afterwards, but there doesn't seem the least chance of your doing that. It's all very well this hockey and cricket that's made such a fuss of at schools nowadays, but it doesn't seem to me that it's going to lead to anything. I'd rather you stuck to your books! Yes, your future's worrying me very much. I've all these little ones to bring up and educate, and I'd hoped you'd be able to earn your own living before long, and lend the children a helping hand. I can't spend anything on giving you an expensive training, Percy has cost me so much out of capital, and it's Letty's turn next, besides which it's high time Ernie and Godfrey were packed off to a boarding-school. Oh, dear! I never seem free from trouble! It's no light anxiety to be the mother of seven children! I often wonder what will become of you all!' To Winona her mother's tearful confidences came as a shock. Up to the present she had been so intensely interested in school affairs that she had given scarcely a thought to her future career. Life had existed for her in detail only to the end of the summer term, after that it had stretched a nebulous void into which her imagination had never troubled to penetrate. Now she took herself seriously to task, and tried to face the prospect of the time when she would have left the Seaton High School. There were many occupations open to girls nowadays besides teaching; they could be doctors, secretaries, sanitary inspectors, artists, musicians, poultry farmers. She knew however, that for any career worth taking up a considerable training would be necessary, and a certain amount of expense involved. What she would have liked very much would be to study at a Physical Training College, and qualify to become a Drill and Games Mistress, but this seemed as unattainable as taking a medical course or going to Girton or Newnham. 'I'm too young yet for a hospital nurse,' she pondered, 'and not clever enough to be an artist or a musician. Well, I suppose I can make munitions, or go on the land! Women are wanted on farms while the war lasts. I could earn my own living, perhaps. But oh, dear! That wouldn't be boosting on the children! I'm afraid mother's fearfully disappointed with me.' She seemed to be looking at things in a new light, and to see her position as it affected others. She was young and brave; surely it was her part to shoulder the family burdens, to shield the frail little mother who grew less and less able to cope with difficulties, to hold out a strong helping hand to the younger brothers and sisters, and so justify her existence on this planet. It had not before occurred to her how much her home people relied on her. The thought of it brought a great lump into her throat. She must not fail them. She could not yet see her way clearly, but somehow she must be a comfort and a support to them, that she was quite resolved. She went back to school in a very thoughtful frame of mind. Her last term would be a full one in many ways. About half of the Sixth Form were to go in for their college entrance examinations, and Miss Bishop had decreed that Winona, as a County Scholarship holder, must certainly be among the number. She had little hope of passing, for most of her subjects were weak, but she meant to make an effort to try to pick up some of her lost ground. Her old enemies, Latin and Chemistry, still often baffled her, and her memory was only moderately retentive. She could not honestly believe that so far as her work was concerned she was any credit to the school. Games were another matter, however, and so long as they did not seriously interfere with her preparation for the matriculation, she meant to do her duty as captain. She arranged cricket fixtures and tennis tournaments, and though she could not devote as much of her own time as she would have liked to practice, she spurred on others who had more leisure than herself. She certainly possessed a gift for organization. There are some captains, splendid players themselves, who can never train their deputies. As Napoleon's genius was supposed to lie largely in his capacity for picking out able generals, so Winona proved her ability by choosing helpers who were of real service to her. With Audrey Redfern, Emily Cooper, and Bertha March to the fore, she hoped that both cricket and tennis would prosper, and that the school would score as successfully during the summer as it had done in the hockey season. On the first Saturday after the beginning of the term, Miss Beach announced that she was going to spend the day with a friend who lived five miles out of Seaton, and that if Winona had leisure to accompany her she would be pleased to take her. No practices had been arranged for that afternoon, so Winona felt free to accept the invitation. She had been for several short runs in the car, but for no long expedition since the memorable outing to Wickborough, so the prospect of a day in the country was alluring. They started at about eleven o'clock, and took a road that was new to Winona, consequently all the more interesting. Their way led through lovely woods, at present a sheet of blue hyacinths, the hedges were a filmy dream of blackthorn blossom, while the swallows wheeling and flashing in the sunshine testified to the return of summer. Miss Carson, the lady whom they were going to visit, like most of Aunt Harriet's friends was engaged in very interesting work. She had taken a small holding, and with the help of a few women pupils was running it as a fruit, flower and poultry farm. The house, an old cottage, to which she had added a wing, was charmingly pretty. It was long and low, with a thick thatched roof, and a porch overgrown with starry white clematis. A budding vine covered the front and in the border below great clumps of stately yellow lilies drooped their queenly heads. The front door led straight into the house place, a square room with a big fire-place and cozy ingle nooks. It was very simply furnished, but looked most artistic with its rush-bottomed chairs, its few good pictures, and its stained green table with the big bowl of wallflowers. Miss Carson, a delightfully energetic lady whose age may have been somewhere between thirty and forty, welcomed them cordially. 'I don't apologize for the plainness of my establishment,' she remarked. 'It's all part of a purpose. We have no servants here, and as we have to do our own house-work in addition to our farm-work, we want to reduce our labor to a minimum. You see, there's hardly anything to dust in this room: the books and the china are in those two cupboards with glass doors, and we have no fripperies at all lying about. The only ornament we allow ourselves is the bowl of flowers. Our bedrooms are equally simple, and our kitchen is fitted with the latest and most up-to-date labor-saving appliances. One of my students is preparing the dinner there now. She's a nice girl, and Winona will perhaps like to go and talk to her, unless she prefers to stay here with us.' Winona promptly decided in favor of the kitchen, so Miss Carson escorted her there, and introduced her to Miss Heald, a jolly-looking girl of about twenty, who, enveloped in a blue overall pinafore, was putting plates to heat, and inspecting the contents of certain boilerettes and casseroles. Like the sitting-room the kitchen contained no unnecessary articles. It was spotlessly clean, and looked very business-like. 'We go on kitchen duty for a week at a time,' explained Miss Heald to Winona. 'It's a part of the course, you know. We have dairy, gardening and poultry as well. Which do I like best? It's hard to say. Poultry, I think, because the chickens are such darlings. I'll show you all round the place this afternoon, when I've finished washing up. I'm going to lay the table now. You can help if you like.' Precisely at one o'clock the seven other students came in from their work. Each was dressed in her farm uniform, short serge skirt, woolen jersey, blue overall and thick boots. To judge from their looks, their occupation was both healthy and congenial, in physique they were Hebes, and their spirits seemed at bubbling point. Apparently they all adored Miss Carson. The latter made a few inquiries as to the morning's progress, and the capable answers testified to the knowledge of the learners. The dinner did credit to Miss Heald's skill; it was well cooked and daintily served. Winona was full of admiration; her culinary experience was limited so far to cakes and scones; she felt that she would have been very proud if she had compounded that stew, and baked those custards. When the meal was finished the students tramped forth again to their outdoor labor, while Miss Heald cleared away. Winona begged to be allowed to help her, and was initiated into the mysteries of the very latest and most sanitary method of washing up, with the aid of mop, dish-rack, and some patent appliances. It was so interesting that she quite enjoyed it. She swept the kitchen, filled kettles at the pump, and did several other odd jobs; then, everything being left in an absolutely immaculate condition, Miss Heald declared that she was ready, and offered to take her companion for a tour of inspection round the farm. The little holding had been well planned, and was skillfully arranged. In front was the garden, a large piece of ground stretching down to the hedge that bordered the road. Miss Carson's original idea had been the culture of flowers, partly for the sale of their blossoms, and partly for the preservation of their seeds, but the national need of producing food crops during the war had induced her to plant almost the whole of it with fruit and vegetables. At present it somewhat resembled a village allotment. Patches of peas and broad beans were coming up well. Groups of gooseberry bushes were thriving. Strawberry beds were being carefully weeded, and two of the students were erecting posts round them, over which nets would be hung later on to protect the fruit from the birds. 'Birds are our greatest pest here,' explained Miss Heald. 'One may like them from a natural history point of view, but you get to hate the little wretches when you see them devouring everything wholesale. They've no conscience. Those small coletits can creep through quite fine meshes, and simply strip the peas, and the blackbirds would guzzle all day if they had the chance. I want to borrow an air gun and pot at them, but Miss Carson won't let me. She's afraid I might shoot some of the other students.' A row of cucumber frames and some greenhouses stood at the bottom of the garden. The latter were mostly devoted to young tomato plants, though one was specially reserved for vegetable marrows. The students had to learn how to manage and regulate the heating apparatus of the houses, as well as to understand the culture of the plants. 'I left a window open once,' confessed Miss Heald. 'I remembered it when I had been about an hour in bed, and I jumped up and dressed in a hurry, and went out with a lantern to shut it. Fortunately there was no frost that night, or all the seedlings might have been killed. It was a most dreadful thing to forget! I thought Miss Carson would have jumped on me, but she was ever so nice about it.' Despite the predominance of foodstuffs there were a few flowers in the garden, clumps of forget-me-not and narcissus, purple iris, golden saxifrages and scarlet anemones. There were fragrant bushes of lavender and rosemary, and beds of sweet herbs, thyme, and basil and fennel and salsafy, for Miss Carson believed in some of the old-fashioned remedies, and made salves and ointments and hair washes from the products of her garden. The orchard, full of pink-blossomed apple trees, was a refreshing sight. They opened a little gate, and walked under a wealth of drooping flowers to the poultry yard that lay at the further side. Everything here was on the most up-to-date system. Pens of beautiful white Leghorns, Black Minorcas and Buff Orpingtons were kept in wired inclosures, each with its own henhouse and scratching-shed full of straw. Miss Heald took Winona inside to inspect the patent nesting-boxes, and the grit-cutting machine. She also showed her the incubators. 'They're empty now, but you should have seen them in the early spring, when they were full of eggs,' she explained. 'It was a tremendous anxiety to keep the lamps properly regulated. Miss Nelson and I sat up all night once when some prize ducklings were hatching. It was cold weather, and they weren't very strong, so they needed a little help. It's the most frightfully delicate work to help a chick out of its shell! It makes a little chip with its beak, and then sometimes it can't get any further, and you have gently to crack the hole bigger. Unless you're very careful you may kill it, but on the other hand, if it can't burst its shell when it's ready to hatch, it may suffocate, so it's a choice of evils. We put them in the drying pen first, and then in the 'foster mother.' They're like babies, and have to be fed every two hours. It's a tremendous business when you have hundreds of them, at different stages and on different diets. We seemed to be preparing food all day long. It's ever so fascinating, though!' 'I love them when they're like fluffy canaries,' said Winona. 'Yes, so do I. I had a special sitting of little ducklings under my charge, and they got very tame. I put them into a basket one day, and carried them into the garden to pick up worms. I put them down on a bed, and while my back was turned for a few minutes they cleared a whole row of young cabbages that Miss Morrison had just planted. I got into fearful trouble, and had to pack up my  protégés  and take them back to their coop in disgrace. I'd never dreamed they would devour green stuff! We have to learn to keep strict accounts of the poultry; we put down the number of eggs daily, and the weekly food bill, and the chickens sold, and make a kind of register, with profit and loss. Miss Carson runs everything on a most business-like basis.' Miss Heald showed Winona the store-room, where meal and grain were kept, the big pans in which food was mixed, the boxes for packing eggs, and the little medicine cupboard containing remedies for sick fowls. All was beautifully orderly and well arranged, and a card of rules for the help of the students hung on the walls. From the poultry department they passed to the Dairy Section. The four sleek cows were out in the field, but in a loose box there were some delightful calves that ran to greet Miss Heald, pressing eager damp noses into her hand, and exhibiting much apparent disappointment that she did not offer them a pailful of milk and oatmeal. Winona inspected the cool, scrupulously clean dairy, with its patent churn, and slate slabs for making up the butter. She saw the bowls where the cream was kept, and the wooden print with which the pats were marked. 'Butter-making is the side of the business I don't care for,' admitted Miss Heald. 'I like the gardening fairly well, and I just love the poultry, but I don't take to dairy work. Of course it's a part of my training, so I'm obliged to do it, but when my time here is over, I mean to make hens my specialty, and go in for poultry farming. An open-air life suits me. It's a thousand times nicer than being a nurse at a hospital, or a secretary at an office. You're in the fresh air all day, and the chicks are so interesting.' A pen of young turkey poults, a flock of goslings, and a sty full of infant pigs were next on exhibition. Miss Heald showed off the latter with pride. 'They're rather darlings, and I own to a weakness for them,' she admitted. 'We put them in a bath and scrub them, and they're really so intelligent. Wasn't it the poet Herrick who had a pet pig? This little chap's as sharp as a needle. I believe I could teach him tricks directly, if I tried! Miss Carson says I mustn't let myself grow too fond of all the creatures, because their ultimate end is bacon or the boilerette, and it doesn't do to be sentimental over farming; but I can't help it! I just love some of the chickens; they come flying up on to my shoulder like pigeons.' A rough-coated pony formed part of the establishment. Twice a week he was harnessed to the trap, and Miss Carson and one of the students drove to Seaton to dispose of the farm produce. Miss Carson had undertaken to supply several hotels and restaurants with eggs, fowls and vegetables, and so far had found the demand for her goods exceeded the supply. Labor was at present her greatest difficulty. Her students accomplished the light work, but could not do heavy digging. She managed to secure the occasional services of a farm hand, but with most able-bodied men at the war the problem of trenching or of making an asparagus bed was almost impossible to solve. At the end of the orchard, against a south hedge of thick holly, stood the hives. Bee-keeping was one of the most successful ventures of the holding. Last autumn had shown a splendid yield of honey, and this year, judging by the activity of the bees, an equal harvest might be expected. There was continuous humming among the apple blossoms, and every minute pollen-laden workers were hurrying home with their spoils. Miss Heald lifted the lid of one of the hives, to show Winona the comb within. She observed caution, however. 'They don't know me very well,' she explained. 'They have their likes and dislikes. Miss Hunter can let them crawl all over her hands and arms, and they never sting her. She must have a natural attraction for them. They recognize a stranger directly. No, I'm not particularly fond of them. I prefer pigs and chickens.' Miss Carson and Aunt Harriet had also been going the round of the farm, and came up to inspect the hives. Miss Beach was greatly interested in her friend's work, and full of congratulations. 'Such women as you are the backbone of the country!' she declared. 'The next best thing to fighting is to provide food for the nation. England is capable of producing twice her annual yield if there is proper organization. I'm a great advocate of small holdings, and I think women can't show their patriotism better than by going 'back to the land.' You and your students are indeed 'doing your bit'! You make me want to come and help you!' It was such a delicious warm afternoon that chairs were carried outside, and they had tea in the garden under a gorgeous pink-blossomed almond tree, with the perfume of wallflowers and sweet scented stocks wafted from the rockery above. Two cats and a dog joined the party, also an impudent bantam cock, who, being considered the mascot of the establishment, was much petted, and allowed certain privileges. He would sit on Miss Carson's wrist like a little tame hawk, and she sometimes brought him into the garden at tea-time to give him tit-bits. At 4.30 all the fowls and chickens were fed, a tremendous business, at which Winona looked on with enthusiasm. She admired the systematic way in which the food was measured and distributed so that each individual member of the flock received its due share, and was not robbed by a greedier and stronger neighbor. She was very reluctant to leave when Miss Beach at last brought round the car. 'How I'd love to go and learn farming when I leave school!' she ventured to remark as they drove home. 'It needs brains!' returned Aunt Harriet, rather snappily. 'You mustn't imagine it's all tea in the garden and playing with fluffy chickens. To run such a holding intelligently requires a clever capable head. Your examination's quite enough for you to think about at present. If you're to have any chance at all of passing, it will take your whole energies, I assure you!' Winona, duly snubbed, held her peace. CHAPTER XVIII A Friend in Need Under the coaching of Miss Goodson the Sixth Form had settled down to grim work. Twelve girls were to present themselves for examination for entering Dunningham University, and though the teacher naturally concentrated her greatest energies on this elect dozen, the rest by no means slipped through her intellectual net. There were stars among the candidates of whom she might feel moderately certain, and there were also laggers whose success was doubtful. In this latter category she classed Winona. Poor Winona still floundered rather hopelessly in some of her subjects. A poetic imagination may be a delightful inheritance and a source of infinite enjoyment to its owner, but it does not supply the place of a good memory. Examiners are prosaic beings who require solid facts, and even the style of a Macaulay or a Carlyle would not satisfy them unless accompanied by definite answers to their set questions. By a piece of unparalleled luck, Winona had secured and retained her County Scholarship, but her powers of essay writing were not likely to serve her in such good stead again. She often groaned when she thought of the examinations. Miss Bishop, Aunt Harriet, and her mother would all be so disappointed if she failed, and alas! her failure seemed only too probable. 'Miss Goodson doesn't tell me plump out that I'll be plucked, but I can see she thinks so!' confided Winona to Garnet one day. 'Then show her she is wrong!' 'Not much chance of that, I'm afraid, but I'm doing my level best. I get up at six every morning, and slave before breakfast.' 'So do I, but I get such frightful headaches,' sighed Garnet. 'I've been nearly mad with them. My cousin took me to the doctor yesterday. He says it's my eyes. I shan't be at school to-morrow. I have to go to Dunningham to see a specialist.' 'Poor old girl! You never told me about your headaches.' 'You never asked me! I've seen so little of you lately;' Winona's conscience smote her. She had rather neglected Garnet since they had entered the Sixth Form. During their year in V.a. they had been fast friends. As new girls together and scholarship holders, a close tie had existed between them, and they had shared in many small excitements and adventures. When Winona was chosen Games Captain, however, their interests seemed to separate. Garnet was not athletic, she cared little for hockey or cricket, and preferred to devote her surplus energies to the Literary Society or the Debating Club. Almost inevitably they had drifted apart. Winona, wrapped up in the supreme fascinations of hockey matches and gymnasium practice, had chummed with Marjorie Kemp, Bessie Kirk, and Joyce Newton, who shared her enthusiasm for games. She remembered with a pang of self-reproach that she had not walked round the playground with Garnet once this term. Winona admired fidelity, but she certainly could not pride herself upon having practiced that virtue of late. Garnet was absent from her desk next day, but when she returned to the school on Thursday, Winona sought an opportunity, and bore her off for a private talk. Garnet was looking very pale. 'I'm dreadfully upset,' she confessed. 'I told you I had to see a specialist about my eyes? Well, yesterday we went to Dunningham, to consult Sir Alfred Pollard. He says there's very serious trouble, and that if I'm not careful, I may ruin my sight altogether. He absolutely forbids any home work in the evenings.' 'Forbids home work!' gasped Winona. 'Yes, utterly! Just think of it! With the examinations only six weeks off! I begged and implored, but he said I might choose between my sight and my exam. I suppose I shall have to fail!' 'Oh, Garnet!' 'Yes,' continued her friend bitterly, 'to fail at the very end, after all my work! And I  have  worked! When other girls have been getting all sorts of fun, I've sat in my bedroom with my books. Oh, it's too cruel!... Don't think me conceited, but I thought I might have a chance for the Seaton Scholarship. It was worth trying for! If you knew how I long to go to College! It would be so glorious to write B.A. after one's name! Besides, I must do something in life. All my sisters have chosen careers, and I had, quite decided to take up teaching as a profession. I talked it over with Miss Goodson one day. She was so nice about it, and strongly advised me to go to College if I could possibly get the opportunity. Well, I suppose that dream's over now! Not much chance of a scholarship with one's prep knocked off!' 'Oh, Garnet, I'm so sorry! Will the doctor let you take the exams, at all?' 'Yes, I may attend school as usual, and go in for the exam., but I'm not to look at a book after 4 p.m. or before 9 a.m., so it's a very empty permission. How I shall rage all the evenings! I wish I had a gramophone to howl out my work into my ears, as I mayn't use my eyes!' 'Would that help you?' asked Winona eagerly. 'Of course it would! It isn't my brain that's wrong, only my eyes. I asked my cousin to read my prep. to me one evening, but it was beyond her, and we only got into a muddle. Oh dear, I could cry! To have worked to within six weeks of the exam., and then to have to slack like this! I'm the unluckiest girl in the world!' Winona comforted her poor friend as best she could. She had an idea at the back of her mind, but she did not venture to confide it to Garnet until she had first consulted Aunt Harriet about it. It was no less a proposal than that they should do their preparation together, and that by reading the work aloud she could act eyes for her chum. It. would be difficult, no doubt, but not an utter impossibility, and it was absolutely the only way in which Garnet could receive help. It would necessitate their spending many hours daily in each other's company, and to arrange this seemed to be the difficulty. She explained the situation to Miss Beach, with some diffidence and hesitation. She was terribly afraid of receiving a snubbing, and being told that her own work was more than sufficient for her, without taking up her friend's burdens. To her surprise, however, Aunt Harriet proved sympathetic, and heartily acquiesced in the scheme. She indeed made the very kind proposal that for the six weeks until the exam. Garnet should sleep with Winona at Abbey Close, so that they might have both the evening and early morning preparation together. Winona carried her friend to a quiet corner of the gymnasium to communicate her thrilling news. 'Win! You don't really mean it? Oh, you're big! I didn't think any one in the world would have done that for me. Do you realize what you're undertaking? It's the one thing that can save me! And only a girl who's in my own Form, and going in for the exams. herself, could do it. Nobody else understands exactly what one wants. Win! I'm ready to worship you!' 'Will your cousin let you come to stay with us?' 'I've no fear of that. She'll be as grateful to you as I am!' Without any further loss of time, Garnet was installed at Abbey Close, and the friends began their joint preparation. Garnet, by the doctor's orders, sat with a black silk handkerchief tied over her eyes, so as to give them all the rest which was possible. Her brain was very alert, however, and her excellent memory retained most of what Winona read to her. At first there were many difficulties to be overcome, for each had had her own way of studying, but after a while they grew used to their united method, and began to make headway with the work. They thoroughly enjoyed being together. To Winona it was almost like being back at the hostel to have a companion in her bedroom, and her many jokes and bits of fun kept up Garnet's spirits. They set their alarm clock for 5.30, and began study promptly at six each morning, after eating the bread and butter and drinking the glasses of milk which, by Aunt Harriet's orders, were always placed in readiness for them. These early hours, when the day was cool, and a fresh breeze blew in through the open window, seemed the most valuable of all; their brains felt clearer, and they were often able to grasp problems and difficult points which had eluded them the evening before. Except for the ordinary practices which formed part of the school curriculum, Winona was obliged for the present to appoint Bessie Kirk as her deputy-Captain. She had no time herself to train juniors, to act referee, or to stand watching tennis sets. It meant a great sacrifice to relinquish these most congenial duties, but she knew Miss Bishop and Miss Goodson approved, and she promised herself to return to them all the more heartily when the examination should be over. She would ask Bessie wistfully for reports of the progress of various stars who were in training, and managed to keep in touch with the games, though she could not always participate in them. 'Wait till June's over, and I'm emancipated! Then won't I have the time of my life!' she announced. 'Thank goodness the match with Binworth isn't till July 21st!' The weeks of strenuous work passed slowly by. The weather was warm and sultry, with frequent thunderstorms, not a favorable atmosphere for study. Garnet flagged palpably, and lost her roses. To Winona the time seemed interminable. The task she had undertaken of helping her friend was a formidable one. It needed all her courage to persevere. Sometimes she longed just for an evening to throw it up, and go and play tennis instead, but every hour was important to Garnet, and must not be lost. Winona often had to set her teeth and force herself to resist the alluring sound of the tennis in the next-door garden, where she had a standing invitation to come and play, and it took all the will power of which she was capable to focus her attention on the examination subjects. She tried not to let Garnet see how much the effort cost her; the latter was sensitive, and painfully conscious of being a burden. Miss Beach dosed both the girls with tonics, and insisted upon their taking a certain amount of exercise. 'Work by all means, but don't over-work,' was her recommendation. 'There's such a thing as bending a bow until it breaks. I don't like to see such white cheeks!' The examination was for entering Dunningham University, and must be taken at that city. The Governors of the Seaton High School had offered a scholarship, tenable for three years, to whichever of their candidates, obtaining First Class honors, appeared highest on the list of passes. They had arranged with the examiners to place the names of the successful candidates in order of merit and on the receipt of the results they would award their exhibition. If no one obtained First Class honors, the offer would be withdrawn, and held over until another year. Several of the girls were well up in their work, and seemed likely to have a chance of winning. Linda Fletcher had the advantage of two years in the Sixth, Agatha James was undoubtedly clever, and Beatrice Howell, though not brilliant, possessed a steady capacity for grind. With three such formidable rivals Garnet's heart might very reasonably fail her. The doctor's prohibition was a most serious handicap for invaluable as her chum's help proved, it was not so effective as being able to use her own eyes. Sometimes she lost courage altogether, and it needed Winona's most dogged determination to keep her mind fixed unwaveringly upon the end in view. 'It's like playing in a match,' Winona assured her. 'If you think the other side's going to win, you may as well throw up the sponge at once. Don't give way an inch until you absolutely know you're beaten. I'm just determined you're to have that scholarship!' 'If I could only think so!' sighed Garnet. 'Oh, Win! what should I do without you? When I'm with you my spirits go up, and I've courage enough for anything, and when I'm by myself I feel a wretched jelly-fish of a creature, just inclined to sit in a corner and blub!' 'No blubbering, please! Worst thing possible for the eyes!' commanded Winona. 'Well, I won't! You've cheered me up tremendously. I'm glad you'll be in the exam. room with me. I shall feel twice as brave if I know you're there!' The days sped on, and the very last one came. Miss Bishop and Miss Goodson had given their final coachings and their most valuable help. Winona and Garnet devoted the evening to mastering one or two doubtful points. 'We've done our best, and it depends now whether we've luck in the questions,' said Winona. 'I think we'd better put the books away. We shall only muddle ourselves if we try any more to-night. Aunt Harriet says we're not to get up at five to-morrow. We shall have quite a hard enough day as it is.' 'It wouldn't be much use,' said Garnet, thrusting back the hair from her hot forehead. 'I feel I've taken in the utmost my brains can hold. There's no room for anything more. How close the air is!' 'I believe we're going to have another storm,' replied Winona, leaning out of the widely opened window, to gaze at the lurid sky. 'There's a feeling of electricity about. Ah! There it begins!' A vivid flash behind the tower of the old Minster was followed by a long rumble of thunder. The atmosphere was painfully oppressive. Again a white streak ran like a corkscrew over the clouds, and a louder peal resounded. The storm was drawing nearer. 'Come from the window, Winona. It's not safe!' Garnet was terribly afraid of thunder. The electricity in the air has a powerful effect upon some temperaments, and at the first sound of heaven's artillery she was crouching beside her bed, with her head buried in the pillow. 'Don't be a silly ostrich!' retorted her chum. 'It's quite far away yet, and if it does come, the chances are a thousand to one against it hitting this particular house. Why, you weren't half so scared of Zeppelins! For goodness' sake don't get hysterical! Show some pluck!' Winona's remarks might not be complimentary, but they were bracing. Garnet laughed nervously, and consented to sit upon a chair. In about half-an-hour the storm blew over, leaving a clear sky and stars. 'Come and put your head out of the window, and feel how deliciously fresh and cool it is!' commanded Winona. 'Look at that bright planet! I think it must be Jupiter. I take it as a good omen for to-morrow. The storm will have cleared your brain, and your star's in the ascendant. Here's luck to the exam.!' The city of Dunningham was about thirty miles away from Seaton. It was a big manufacturing city, with a highly flourishing modern university, which had lately come much to the fore, and had begun to make itself a reputation. The three days' examination was to be held in the University buildings, and all candidates were bound to present themselves there. Miss Bishop had decided that the contingent of twelve from the Seaton High School should travel to Dunningham each morning by the early express, under the charge of Miss Lever, who would take them out for lunch, and escort them safely back to Seaton again in the evening. The arrangement necessitated an early start, but nobody minded that. The little party met at the railway station in quite bright spirits. It was rather fun, all going to Dunningham together, and having a special compartment engaged for them on the train. It was a difficult matter for thirteen people to cram into seats only intended for the accommodation of ten, but they preferred over-crowding to separation, and cheerfully took it in turns to sit on one another's knees. 'It's more like a beanfeast than the exam.!' laughed Mary Payne, handing round a packet of chocolates. 'I feel I absolutely don't care!' 'I feel like a criminal on the road to execution!' groaned Helena Maitland. 'Usedn't they to give the poor wretches anything they asked for? Oh, yes, thanks! I'll have a chocolate by all means, but it's crowning the victim with a garland of roses!' 'Rather mixed metaphors, my child! If you don't express yourself more clearly in your papers, I'm afraid you won't satisfy the examiners!' 'I wonder who corrects the papers?' asked Freda Long. 'Oh! some snarling old dry-as-dust, probably, who's anxious to get through the job as quickly as he can. It must be a withering experience to go through thousands of papers. Enough to pulverize your brains for the rest of your life!' 'I don't mind the examiners' brains. It's my own I'm anxious about. If they'll last me out these three days, I'll be content to exist at a very low mental level afterwards!' 'Right you are! Ditto this child! I'm going to read nothing but the trashiest novels during the holidays!' announced Mary aggressively. 'And I'm not going to read at all! I shall just lounge and play tennis,' added Hilda. 'Poor dears! I used to feel like that, but one gets over it!' smiled Miss Lever. 'Don't eat too many caramels, or you'll be so thirsty in the exam room. Malted milk tablets are the best thing; they're sweet, but sustaining. Plain chocolate is the next best. I shall think of you all the whole morning.' 'You'll have a lovely time gallivanting round Dunningham and shop-gazing, while we're racking our brains!' said Garnet. 'We're all envious!' 'Remember, I've had my purgatory before!' returned Miss Lever, laughing. 'You must allow me a good time in my old age!' Arrived at Dunningham station, they took the tramcar, and proceeded straight to the University. It was a very fine modern building, erected round three sides of a large quadrangle, the fourth side being occupied by a museum. They were directed to the Women Students' Department, and took off their hats and coats in the dressing-room. Miss Lever, who had herself graduated at Dunningham, knew the place well, and was able to give them exact directions. She escorted them across the quadrangle to the big hall where the examination was to be held. 'The place has a classic look,' said Garnet, gazing at the Corinthian columns of the portico. 'I'm afraid they won't consider my Latin up to standard. May the fates send me an easy paper!' 'You should have asked them before!' giggled Winona. 'The papers are printed now, and not all the gods of Olympus could alter a letter. I accept my fortunes in the spirit of a Mahomedan. It's Kismet!' The first set of questions was easier than the girls had dared to expect. They scribbled away eagerly. It was encouraging, at any rate, to make a good beginning. They compared notes at the end of the morning, and arrived at the conclusion that all had done fairly well. Miss Lever was waiting for them in the quadrangle when they came out, and announced that she had engaged a special table for the party at a restaurant, and had ordered a particularly nice little lunch, with coffee afterwards to clear their brains. Some of the girls were tired, and inclined to groan, others were exhilarated, but the enthusiasts cheered up the weaker spirits, and by the time the coffee course was reached, everybody was feeling courageous. 'Should I dare to suggest ices?' murmured Winona. 'All right, if you like. There's just time,' assented Miss Lever, consulting her watch. 'I passed my Intermediate on ices during a spell of intensely hot weather. I can allow you exactly five minutes, so choose quickly, strawberry or vanilla?' The three days of the examination seemed to Winona like a dream. She grew quite accustomed to the big hall full of candidates, and to her particular desk. Garnet sat at the other side of the aisle, and Winona would sometimes pause a moment to watch her. To judge from her friend's absorbed appearance and fast moving pen, the papers appeared to suit her. To Winona's immense astonishment she herself was doing quite moderately well. The six weeks' coaching of Garnet had been of inestimable benefit to her own work. She had not then thought of this aspect of the matter, but she was certainly now reaping the reward of her labor of love. For the first time the possibility of gaining a pass occurred to her. 'If I do, it'll be the limit!' she reflected. 'Miss Bishop will have about the surprise of her life!' On the whole the girls quite enjoyed their three days at Dunningham. There were intervals between their various papers, which they spent partly in the University museum and partly in the City Art Gallery, where a fine collection of Old Masters was on loan. It was the first time Winona had seen paintings by world-famous artists, though she had often pored over reproductions of their works in  The Studio  or  The Connoisseur . She felt that the experience added another window to her outlook on life. 'I wish I'd the talent to be an artist!' she thought. 'There are so many things I'd like to do! Oh, dear! Painting and music (both beyond me utterly) and physical culture and poultry farming, and Red Cross nursing, and I probably shan't do any of them, after all! I want to be of solid use to the world in a nice interesting way to myself, and I expect I'll just have to do a lot of stupid things that I hate. Why wasn't I born a Raphael?' 'How do you think you've got on altogether?' Garnet asked Winona, as, thoroughly tired out, the two girls traveled homeward to Seaton at the end of the third day's examination. 'Um, tolerably. Better, perhaps, than I expected, but that's not saying much. And you?' 'I never prophesy till I know!' But Garnet's dark eyes shone as she leaned back in her corner. CHAPTER XIX The Swimming Contest Once the examinations were over, Winona's spirits, which had been decidedly at Il Penseroso, went up to L'Allegro. The strain of coaching Garnet had been very great, but the relief was in corresponding proportion. She felt as if a burden had rolled from her shoulders. There was just a month of the term left. The Sixth would of course be expected to do its ordinary form work, but the amount of home study required would be reasonable, quite a different matter from the intolerable grind of preparation for a University examination. The extra afternoon classes with Miss Goodson were no longer necessary, leaving a delightful period of leisure half-hours at school. Winona intended to employ these blissful intervals in cricket practice, at the tennis courts, in helping to arrange the museum, and in carrying out several other pet schemes that she had been forced hitherto to set aside. Bessie Kirk had made a good deputy, but it was nice to take the reins into her own hands once more, and feel that she was head of the Games department. She coached her champions assiduously. At tennis Emily Cooper and Bertha March stood out like planets among the stars. They had already beaten Westwood High School and Hill Top Secondary School, and hoped to have a chance against Binworth College, of hitherto invincible reputation. The match would not take place for a fortnight, which gave extra time for practice. In cricket, Betty Carlisle had come to the front at bowling, while Maggie Allesley and Irene Swinburne were heroines of the bat. It is inevitable that some girls should overtop the rest, but Winona would not on that account allow the others to slack. She knew the importance of a high general average of play, and urged on several laggers. She thoroughly realized the importance of fielding, and made her eleven concentrate their minds upon it. 'We lost Tamley on fielding,' she affirmed, 'and if we've any intention of beating Binworth, we've just got to practice catching and throwing in.' Of the two matches in which the school had so far taken part, the first, with Baddeley High School, had been a draw, and in the second, with Tamley, they had been beaten. It was not an encouraging record, and Winona felt that for the credit of the school it was absolutely necessary to vanquish Binworth. Its team had a fairly good reputation, so it would be no easy task, but after the hockey successes of last winter she did not despair. Apart from school she had a very pleasant time. Nearly every evening after supper Aunt Harriet would suggest a short run in the car before sunset. She generally allowed her niece to take the wheel as soon as they were clear of the town traffic, and Winona soon became quite expert at driving. She liked to feel the little car answering to her guidance; there was a thrill in rounding corners and steering past carts, and every time she went out she gained fresh confidence. She was not at all nervous, and kept her head admirably in several small emergencies, managing so well that Aunt Harriet finally allowed her to bring the car back down the High Street, which, as it was the most crowded portion of the town, was considered the motorist's ordeal in Seaton. She acquitted herself with great credit, passed a tramcar successfully, and understood the signals of the policeman who waved his hand at the corner. Aunt Harriet had taken out a driver's license for her, so having proved her skill in the High Street, she now felt quite a full-fledged lady chauffeur. Winona immensely enjoyed these evening runs when the sky was aflame with sunset, and the trees were quiet dark masses of color, and the long road stretched out before her, pink from the glow above, and the lacey hemlocks and meadowsweets made a soft blurred border below the hedgerows. With an open road in front of her she was tempted sometimes to put on speed, and felt as if she were flying onwards into a dream country where all was vague and mysterious and shadowy and unknown. She was always loth to return, but Aunt Harriet was extremely particular that they must be home before lighting-up time, and would point remorselessly to the small clock that hung facing the seat. Perhaps Winona's greatest triumph was when, one evening, she managed without any assistance to run the car into its own shed in the garage, a delicate little piece of steering which required fine calculation, a quick hand, and a rapid turn. She was learning something of the mechanism, too, could refill the petrol tank, and was almost anxious for a tire to burst, so that she might have the opportunity of putting on the Stepney wheel, though this latter ambition was not shared by her aunt. 'When all the men have gone to the war, I'll be able to drive a taxi or a war van, and make myself useful to the Government! I believe I could clean the car perfectly well if Sam should be called up, and has to leave the garage. I'd just enjoy turning the hose on it. What would they give me a week to take Sam's place here?' 'They'd give you a snubbing if you asked them!' laughed Aunt Harriet. 'Cleaning a car is uncommonly hard work. You might manage our small one, but by the time you'd done the whole round of the garage, you'd be ready to declare it wasn't a woman's job.' 'I'd chance it!' retorted Winona. She had her opportunity after all, for the garage attendant was taken ill, and remained off duty for several days. On the Saturday morning Winona set to work and cleaned, polished and oiled the car thoroughly. It was very dirty after a muddy day's use, so she had her full experience. It was certainly far harder than she had anticipated, and she felt devoutly thankful that she was not bound to attack the cars in the other sheds, and perform similar services for each. 'Sam earns his money,' she assured Aunt Harriet, when she returned at lunch-time. 'On the whole, I've decided I won't be a lady chauffeur. It's bad enough to have to clean one's bicycle, but if I had to go through this car performance every day, I don't think there'd be very much left of me.' 'Ah! I told you so!' returned, Aunt Harriet triumphantly. Motoring was not the only fresh form of activity which Winona had taken up this summer. The school had organized swimming classes, and on certain clean-water days detachments of girls were conducted to the public baths. Owing to her college entrance examinations, Winona had not been able to attend the full course, but she had learnt to swim last summer at the baths, and was as enthusiastic as anybody. Miss Medland, the teacher, was an expert from Dunningham; she was skillful herself, and clever at training her pupils. The girls soon gained confidence in the water, and began to be able to perform what they called 'mermaid high jinks.' The Public Baths at Seaton were most remarkably good, so good indeed that many of the citizens had raised a protest against the Corporation for spending so much money upon them. The High School girls, who had not to pay the rates, did not sympathize with the grumbles of ratepayers, and rejoiced exceedingly in the sumptuous accommodation. They specially appreciated the comfort of the dressing-rooms, and the convenience of the hot-air apparatus for drying their hair. The restaurant, where tea or bovril could be had, was also a luxury for those who were apt to turn shivery after coming from the water. 'I can understand why the Romans were so enthusiastic about their public baths,' said Audrey Redfern. 'Just think of having little trays of eatables floating about on the water, so that you could have a snack whenever you wanted, and slaves to bring you delicious scent afterwards, and garlands of flowers. I wish I'd lived some time B.C. instead of in the twentieth century!' 'Be thankful you didn't live in the twelfth, for then you mightn't have had a bath at all!' returned Winona; 'certainly not a public one, and probably not the private one either. An occasional canful of water would have been thought quite sufficient for you, with perhaps a dip in a stream if you could get it. The people who bathed were mostly pilgrims at Holy Wells, and they all used the same water, no matter what their diseases were.' 'How disgusting! Well, on the whole I'm tolerably satisfied to belong to the poor old twentieth century. It might be better, but it might be worse.' 'How kind of you! I'm sure posterity will be grateful for your approval.' 'D'you want me to push you into the water, Winona Woodward? I will, in half a second!' At the end of the course it was arranged that a swimming contest should take place among the girls, and that various prizes should be offered for championships. It was the first event of the kind in the annals of the school, so naturally it aroused much enthusiasm. About thirty candidates were selected by Miss Medland as eligible for competitions, the rest of her pupils having to content themselves with looking on. A special afternoon was given up to the display, and invitations were sent out to parents to come and help to swell the audience. 'Are you in for the mermaidens' fête?' Winona asked Marjorie Kemp. 'Mermaidens' fête, indeed! How romantic we are all of a sudden! The frog fight, I should call it.' 'There speaks the voice of envy! You're evidently out of it.' 'Don't want to be in it, thanks! It'll be wretched work shivering round the edge of the bath for a solid hour!' 'Sour grapes, my child!' teased Winona. 'Go on, my good girl, if you want to make me raggy, you just shan't succeed, that's all!' 'Now I  should  like to have been chosen!' mourned Evelyn Richards. 'I don't mind confessing that I've had a disappointment. I thought I could swim quite as well as Freda, and it's grizzly hard luck that she was picked out and I wasn't. Rank favoritism, I call it!' 'Poor old Eve! Look here, I'll tell you a secret. You head the reserve list. I know because I saw it. If anybody has a cold on the day of the event, you'll take her place.' 'You mascot! Shall I? Oh! I do hope somebody'll catch cold, not badly, but just enough to make it unsafe to go into the water. You can't think how I want to try my luck. I don't suppose I've a chance of a prize, but if I did get one, why I'd cock-a-doodle-do the school down!' 'I'm quite sure you would! Trust you to blow your own trumpet!' 'Winona Woodward, if you'd been properly and thoroughly spanked in your babyhood, you'd be a much more civil person now. I decline your company. Ta-ta!' 'Poor old Eve! Take it sporting!' said Winona soothingly. On the afternoon of the great event, the ladies' large bath was specially reserved for the school. A goodly crowd of spectators filled almost to overflowing the galleries that ran round the hall; interested fathers and mothers, sympathetic aunts, and a sprinkling of cousins and friends made up the visitors' list, and the rest of the space was crammed with school girls. Each likely champion had her own set of supporters, who murmured her name as a kind of war cry, and were only restrained from shouting it at the pitch of their lungs by the sight of Miss Bishop, who stood below, talking to Miss Medland and the judge. The enthusiasm went perhaps more by favor than by actual prowess, and could hardly be taken as an augury of success, for Barbara Jones, who was popular, received much more encouragement than Olga Dickinson, who had distanced her every time at the practices. Juniors will be juniors, however, and the fourth and third forms stamped solidly for Barbara, ignoring the superior claims of her rival. The bath, with its blue and white tiles, looked tempting. All the school envied the candidates as they came marching in in their costumes. 'Evelyn's got a place after all!' said Garnet, who was among the spectators, to Gladys Cooper, who sat next to her. 'Some one else must be off, then. Who is it? Freda Long? Poor old Freda! Got toothache? It's hard luck on her! There's Winona. I don't believe she'll win, but I'll cheer her! Rather!' Winona also did not think it likely that she would win. She had only had time for half the lessons, which put her at a serious disadvantage with girls who had taken the full course. It was unsporting, however, to go in confident of defeat, so she meant to do her best. The first event was the Upper School Championship for the fastest swimmer. The candidates stood ready at the edge of the bath, then at the given signal they flung themselves into the water, and started. At first they were fairly even, but after a dozen yards or so several shot ahead. The irrepressible juniors lost all control in their excitement, and cheered on each as she appeared to be gaining. 'Audrey Redfern!' 'No, no! Jess Gardner!' 'Winona Woodward!' 'Elsie Parton's passed her!' 'No, no! Winona's making up!' 'She'll never do it, though!' 'It's a draw!' As a matter of fact Winona and Elsie Parton touched the winning tape at the very identical moment. It was a great surprise for both of them. Winona had expected Jess or Audrey to be first, and never thought of Elsie as a possible champion. Elsie was in V.b. and had not been very long at the school. No one had taken much notice of her up to now, and the girls were rather staggered at her success. They did not even clap her as she climbed up from the bath. The judge wrote down the result, and called the next event. This was the Lower School Championship, and the juniors were soon screaming for Barbara Jones and Daisy James. The latter had it by a length, and walked away smiling, to be wrapped up in a towel by Miss Lever, for she was a chilly little creature, and apt to be taken with fits of shivers if she stood long out of the water. Diving followed, both from the edge of the bath and from the diving board. In the Senior division Audrey and Jess secured the highest scores, neither Winona nor Elsie coming near them. Winona was not really very fond of diving, while Elsie staked her all upon extreme speed. The Juniors did almost better than their elders, Olga Dickinson's achievement quite carrying the enthusiasm of the hall. The next competition was for style. The candidates swam first on their sides, then on their backs, and finally on their backs moving their legs only, their arms being placed on their hips. The judge put down marks for each according to what she considered their deserts; until the list should be made up, nobody knew who, in her expert opinion, had done the best. It was now the turn of the Midnight Race, a most important event, to which the spectators were looking forward keenly. Only the best swimmers were allowed to take part, the other candidates had to content themselves with watching. The selected ten retired to the dressing-room, and in a few moments emerged, each clad in a long white nightdress, and holding a candlestick with a lighted candle in her hand. A roar of applause rose from the gallery as the white-robed figures formed into line. Every girl placed her candlestick on the edge of the bath, and getting into the water, held on to the rail at attention. When the judge gave the signal, each seized her candlestick and commenced to swim on her back to the other side of the bath, holding up the candle in her left hand. It was a feat that required steadiness and skill. Evelyn Richards tried to hurry too fast, and the draft caused by her over-quick passage blew out her flame. Mollie Hill caught her foot in her nightdress, and dropped her candle altogether. Jess Gardner pursued the original method of holding her candlestick in her teeth, and using both arms to swim. There was keen excitement as the candidates cautiously worked their way across. Each was required to place her candle for a second on the edge of the bath, and then to swim back to the original starting point. Only five competitors were in the running for the return journey, Winona, Audrey Redfern, Elsie Parton, Dora Lloyd (a Fourth Form girl), and little Olga Dickinson. The temptation to swim too fast was overwhelming, and Audrey fell a victim to it, her flame going out just in the middle of the bath. Olga Dickinson actually reached the starting point the first, but Winona and Elsie Parton were only a second behind her, placing their candlesticks down at the very same moment. 'I wonder how the score's going?' said Winona, as the Seniors stood watching the Junior Handicap Race. 'I've no idea,' returned Audrey. 'You see we don't know what marks Miss Gatehead has given for style, and several other things. She doesn't judge exactly like Miss Medland does. It's a pity Freda Long's out of it.' 'What happened to Freda?' 'Got toothache. Can't you see her sitting up there in the gallery, holding her cheek? She's looking at you!' 'Poor old Freda! Beastly hard luck!' murmured Winona, waving a sympathetic greeting to her friend. The Midnight Race had been intensely interesting, but the Obstacle Race proved an even greater excitement. Two thin planks of wood were placed across the bath, floating upon the water. The competitors started from the deep end, dived under the first plank, and then scrambled over the second. At the shallow end were a number of large round wash-tubs; each candidate had to seize upon one of these and seat herself in it, a most difficult feat of fine balancing, for unless she hit upon the exact center of gravity, the tub promptly overturned, and flung her into the water. It was a most mirth-provoking competition, candidates and spectators bursting into shouts of laughter as one after another the girls gingerly climbed into their tubs, and toppled over into the bath. Those who managed at last to preserve their equilibrium were given paddles, and had to navigate themselves to the nearest plank, where they invariably fell out, and were rescued and towed back by attendant nymphs told off for the purpose. Nobody succeeded in paddling to the plank and back again, and the competition resolved itself into a series of splashes, squeals and bursts of mirth. Even stately Miss Bishop was laughing heartily, and the girls in the gallery were in a state bordering on hysteria. At last Miss Gatehead called order, and the dripping candidates retired from their water carnival to await the judging. The scores were rapidly added up, and the result was announced. 'Winona Woodward and Elsie Parton equal. They will therefore swim the length of the bath to decide the championship.' Planks and tubs were hastily cleared away from the field of action, and the rival candidates started on their final contest. The sympathies of the gallery went strongly with Winona; the girls wanted their Games Captain to win, and they cheered her vigorously. But Winona was tired, Elsie Parton was lithe and active, and had made fast swimming her specialty. Winona did her sporting best, but by the middle of the bath Elsie had distanced her, and reached the winning post a whole length ahead. There was dead silence from the girls in the gallery. Their Captain had failed, and they did not mean to applaud her opponent. Winona, looking upwards, saw the popular feeling in their faces. All her generous spirit rose in revolt. She was standing close to Miss Bishop, Miss Gatehead and Miss Medland, and therefore it was certainly a breach of school etiquette for her to do what she did, but acting on the impulse of the moment she shouted: 'Cheer, you slackers! Three cheers for Elsie Parton!' and waving her hand as a signal, led off the 'Hip-hip-hip hurrah!' A very volume of sound followed, and the roof rang as Miss Bishop presented the winner with the cup for the Championship. 'Thanks  awfully , Winona!' said Elsie, as the girls walked away to the dressing-rooms. 'I'm afraid I've disappointed the school, but I did want to win!' 'Of course you did, and why shouldn't you? I hope I can take a beating in a sporting way! I think I made them ashamed of themselves. Fair play and no favoritism is the tradition of this school, and I mean to have no nasty cliquey feeling in it so long as I'm Games Captain, or my name's not Winona Woodward! That's the law of the Medes and Persians!' CHAPTER XX The Red Cross Hospital Winona received constant letters from Percy in the trenches 'somewhere in France,' all, of course, carefully censored. They had arranged a cryptogram before he left England, however, and by its aid he was able to tell her the name of the place near which he was fighting. It was a tremendous excitement for her when his letters arrived to fetch her key to the cryptogram and reckon out the magic little word that let her know his whereabouts. She would find the spot on the big war-map that hung in the dining-room and would mark it with a miniature flag, feeling in closer touch with him now she knew exactly where he was located. She kept a special album in which she placed photos of him in khaki, all his letters and postcards, and any newspaper cuttings that concerned his regiment. The book was already half full; she looked it over almost daily, and kept it as, at present, her greatest treasure. She sent parcels regularly to Percy. Campaigning had not destroyed his boyish love for sweetstuff, and he welcomed cakes, toffee and chocolate. 'I share it with the other chaps,' he wrote, 'and they give you a vote of thanks every time. You wouldn't believe what larks we have in our dug-out!' Percy's letters were in his old gay style, but every now and then Winona noticed a more serious vein running through them. He had sad news to tell sometimes. Two of his special chums were killed in action, the young doctor was shot while attending to the wounded, and their chaplain had been injured. 'We never know when our turn will come,' he finished, and Winona shivered as she kissed the letter and put it away. She looked up sometimes at the calm clear globe of the full moon and thought how it was shining down alike on the far-away trenches of France and the great Minster towers of Seaton. How many battles had it seen in the earth's history, and how many still forms lying stiff and straight under its pale beams? Men fought and died, and the moon and the stars passed on their way, uncaring, but God cared, and at the back of it all His Hand was guiding the world, and even from seeming chaos would bring good out of evil at His own time. 'God bless Percy, and bring him safe home!' prayed Winona passionately, but she felt in her heart of hearts that if the Great Captain called him, she could bend her head in the knowledge that He knew best. With the hot July weather Aunt Harriet's health flagged. She seemed suddenly to have grown much older. The erect figure stooped a little, her high color had faded and her voice lost some of its energy and determination. She was not able to fulfill all her former public duties, and she fretted greatly at the enforced inaction. She was one of those characters who would rather wear out than rust out, and it required the utmost firmness on the part of her doctor to persuade her from over-exerting herself. Instead of being in a continual whirl of crèche committee meetings, workhouse inspections, and crèche management, she now spent long quiet afternoons in the shaded drawing-room learning that (to her) hardest of all lessons, how to rest! Winona, busy with the last exciting weeks of the school term, was too occupied to give much thought to her aunt, but could not help remarking that the latter's spirits had failed lately. Miss Beach was far gentler than of yore. She did not snap her niece up so suddenly, or give vent to excited tirades about subjects which irritated her. Sometimes she even looked at Winona with a wistfulness that the girl noticed. It puzzled her, for it was the same half-appealing glance that her mother often cast at her. She was accustomed to shoulder her mother's burdens, and loved her all the more for her helplessness and dependence. But Aunt Harriet, so strong and determined and capable, the oracle of the family, and the very epitome of all the cardinal virtues, surely  she  could not want any one to lean upon? The idea was unthinkable. Yet again and again it returned to her, and the consciousness of it stirred new chords. One evening Winona came rather softly into the drawing-room. Her aunt, sitting by the window in the gathering twilight, did not hear her enter. Miss Beach was reading, and the last little gleam of the sunset fell on her gray hair. How worn she looked, Winona thought. It had never struck her so forcibly before. Was that a tear shining on her cheek? Miss Beach rose slowly, put down her book, took her handkerchief from her bag and deliberately wiped her eyes; then, still unconscious of her niece's presence, she went out through the French window into the garden. Winona walked across the room, hesitated for a moment but did not venture to follow her. Almost automatically she took up the book which Aunt Harriet had been reading. It was a little volume of extracts, and one had been marked with a penciled cross:,      'Put your arms around me,      There, like that:     I want a little petting     At life's setting,     For 'tis harder to be brave     When feeble age comes creeping,     And finds me weeping,     Dear ones gone.     Just a little petting     At life's setting:     For I'm old, alone and tired,     And my long life's work is done.' The tears rushed to Winona's eyes. Did Aunt Harriet really feel like that? Oh, why could she not go and comfort her? She turned impulsively into the garden. The slow steps were coming back up the paved walk. She would have given worlds to walk up to her aunt and fling her arms round her, but the old sense of shyness and reserve held her back. Miss Beach was passing along the border, her dress brushing the flowers as she went by. It would surely be easy to join her, and at least to take her arm! Easy? No! She had never done such a thing in her life with her aunt. A peck of a kiss was the only mark of affection that they had hitherto exchanged. Winona looked and longed to express her sympathy, but the invisible barrier seemed strong as ever. Aunt Harriet turned aside and went towards the kitchen. The opportunity was lost. 'How horribly we live right inside ourselves!' thought Winona. 'How few people know just what we're feeling and thinking, and how hard it is to let them know! The 'I' at the back of me is so different from the outside of me! When I want to say things I turn stupid and my tongue stops. I suppose most other people feel really the same, and we all live in our own little world and only touch one another now and then. Human speech is such a poor medium. Will it be dropped in the next life, and shall we talk with our hearts?' It was on the very morning after this that Winona received an agitated letter from home. Her mother had bad news. Percy had been wounded, and was in the Red Cross Hospital at Prestwick. Mrs. Woodward wrote hurriedly, for she was on the point of starting off to see him, but she promised to send a bulletin directly after her visit. Winona spent a horrible day. Percy was never for a moment out of her thoughts. The insufficiency of the information made it harder to bear. She did not know whether the wound was slight or dangerous, and her fears whispered the worst. The next report, however, was more reassuring. Percy had had an operation and the doctors hoped that with care he ought to do well. A daily bulletin would be sent to his mother, and she promised to forward it punctually to Abbey Close. 'But I shan't get it till the day afterwards!' exclaimed Winona tragically. 'Oh, how I wish he were at the Red Cross Hospital here instead of at Prestwick! If I could only see him!' 'Cheer up! Things might be worse!' remarked her aunt briefly. Miss Beach said no more at the moment, but at supper time she announced: 'We shall have to breakfast early to-morrow morning, Winona. You and I are going to Prestwick for the day. I've asked Miss Bishop to let you off.' 'To Prestwick?' gasped Winona. 'To the Red Cross Hospital? Oh, Aunt Harriet, do you suppose they'll let us see Percy?' 'It's visitors' day, for I telegraphed to inquire. I wasn't going on a wild-goose chase, I assure you. I know the red tape of hospitals only too well. We may see him between two-thirty and four o'clock. It's a long journey, of course, and the trains are awkward from Seaton, but we can be back by nine.' 'Oh, thank you! Thank you!' said Winona, with shining eyes. She lay awake for hours that night thinking of to-morrow's expedition. Her brain seemed turning round and round in a whirl. To see Percy and assure herself that he was alive, and likely to recover! Oh, it was worth traveling to the North Pole! When at last she slept her dreams were a confusion of agonized escapes from Zeppelins, or rushing from trenches pursued by Germans. She was glad to wake, even though it was much too early yet to get up. The sun was only just rising behind the Minster towers. Never mind! It was morning, and to-day, actually to-day, she would see Percy! By nine o'clock Miss Beach and Winona were speeding along in the express for Dunningham. Here they changed, and began a slow and tiresome cross-country journey, with a couple of hours to wait at an uninteresting junction. 'We shall get back a little quicker than we came,' Aunt Harriet explained, 'because we can take advantage of the boat express, which will save us an hour and a half. It's most wearisome to jog along in these local trains, stopping at every tiny little station.' 'One longs to be in the car,' said Winona. 'We might have gone in the car if it had been within reasonable distance. We couldn't possibly have motored to Prestwick and back in a day, though! Trains may be hot and stuffy, but they get one over the ground.' It was nearly two o'clock before they reached their destination. They had just time for a hasty lunch at a restaurant, and then Aunt Harriet hailed a taxi and they drove to the hospital. This was a large, fine house in the suburbs, given up by its patriotic owner to the use of the Red Cross. As they turned in at the gate they could see an attractive garden, where groups of Tommies in their blue invalid uniforms were lounging in deck chairs, or lying full length on rugs spread upon the grass. An orderly showed them to the office, where Miss Beach had a brief interview with the Commandant, and they were then escorted by a V.A.D. nurse to the Queen Mary Ward. Winona had not been in a hospital before, so all was new to her, the large airy room with its polished floor and wide-open windows, the rows of beds, each with its little cupboard by the side, the table full of flowers in the center, the nurses in their neat Red Cross uniforms. She had no time, however, for more than a hurried glance round; her eyes were busy searching for the one particular bed that was the object of their journey. 'Private Woodward is in Number eleven,' said the V.A.D., motioning them to the right-hand side of the room. Percy lay on his back with a cradle over his injured leg. His face was very white and thin, and greatly changed. The old boyish expression had vanished, there were firm lines round the mouth and a resolute look in the eyes, which had not been there before. A few months in the trenches, and a baptism of fire, had transformed the careless, happy-go-lucky lad into a man. Tears glistened in Winona's eyes as she bent down to kiss him. It was hard to see her active brother lying helpless and suffering. [Illustration: 'THE BARRIER WAS DOWN AT LAST'] 'Oh, I'm better now,' he replied in answer to her inquiries. 'I don't have pain all the time. I was pretty bad after the meds. had been doing their carving. I can tell you I welcomed the morphia! But I don't need it so often now, and my leg's going on splendidly. It'll be a first-rate job when it's finished. Old Jackson promises to have me out of bed on crutches before so long!' 'Crutches!' gasped Winona, in alarm. 'Why, just at first, of course!' 'We hope he won't need to use them for long,' said Aunt Harriet. 'The Commandant tells me they're very proud of your case at the hospital, Percy! They flatter themselves they've saved your leg where some surgeons would have amputated. You seem very comfortable here. It's a nice ward.' 'Oh, yes, they're angelic to me. I'm a spoilt child, I can tell you. I was lucky to get into a 'Red Cross.' They're stuffing us here all day, and those chaps that can go about are having the time of their lives, motor drives, tea parties, concerts, and all the rest of it! The Prestwick people regularly fête them. One of our V.A.D.'s here has asked a dozen of us out to tea at her own home to-morrow. I wish I could go! It's the nurse who showed you in. She's ripping.' 'I've always heard 'V.A.D.' stands for 'Very Attractive Damsel,'' laughed Winona. 'Don't lose your heart before you're twenty-one, Percy!' said Aunt Harriet, smiling quite indulgently. 'You've two and a half years left yet!' 'When a chap's in the Army his age doesn't count!' declared Percy with dignity. Most of the beds in the ward were empty at present, their owners being outside in the garden. Only four were occupied. Each of these Tommies had his own little group of visitors, and was too busy talking to them to take much notice of anybody else. Miss Beach spent a short time at Percy's bedside, then, thinking that the brother and sister would like to be left alone together she expressed her intention of looking over the hospital, and went to find a V.A.D. to show her round. 'It was ever so decent of Aunt Harriet to bring you, Tiddleywinks!' said Percy. 'The mater said I mustn't expect you to come!' 'Aunt Harriet's a trump when you know her!' 'You used to call her a dragon.' 'I don't now.' 'Look here! I often wish I hadn't burnt that paper of hers. You know what I mean! I've kept thinking about it while I've been lying here. It was a blighter's trick to do, when she was paying my school fees. She ought to be told about it! I feel that now. You haven't breathed anything, have you?' 'Not a word! I promised, you remember.' 'You can keep a secret, Win. I'll say that for you! Somehow I feel as if I want to make a clean breast of it. Aunt Harriet's done a lot for our family. I'd tell her now, only very likely when she comes back a nurse will be with her. It's just tea-time.' 'Could you write to her?' 'A ripping idea! I never thought of that. I'll write to-morrow. I'll be glad to get it off my mind. Somehow, when one's been through all this, one feels quite differently about things.' The entrance of tea trays interrupted the conversation. Miss Beach returned in company with a nurse, and reminded her niece that if they wished to catch their train home they must be starting at once. It was hard to say good-by, but Winona went away infinitely comforted. Dearly as she had always loved the old Percy, she felt the new one whom she had met to-day had the makings of a stronger and finer character than she had ever dared to hope. 'The Commandant gives an excellent report of him,' said Miss Beach as they drove away. 'I asked her particularly if there were any likelihood of his remaining lame, but she says not. The surgeon declares he'll have him back in the trenches in the autumn.' 'How glorious! Percy's just wild to go back. I believe he'll do something splendid, and get a commission, or perhaps win the Victoria Cross!' Winona's face shone. She had been proud of Percy to-day. The long journey home to Seaton was very tedious, though not quite so trying as the morning one, for they were able to catch the boat express to Lapton and have tea on the train. At Lapton Junction, however, they were obliged to change to a local line, and jog along at the rate of about thirty miles an hour in a particularly dusty compartment. It had been a hard day for Miss Beach. She looked very weary as she leaned back in her corner, so overdone indeed that Winona was afraid she was going to have one of her heart attacks. The threatened trouble passed, however, and as the evening grew cooler she seemed to revive. The trains were late, so it was nearly ten o'clock before they at last reached home. ''Mighty pleased with our day's outing,' to quote Mr. Pepys,' said Aunt Harriet. 'It was worth going!' 'If it hasn't tired you too much!' Winona ventured to add. On the following Sunday morning Miss Beach received a letter from Percy. She made no comment upon it at the time, but in the evening, after church, when she and Winona were walking in the garden in the twilight, she referred to it. 'I'm deeply touched by Percy's letter,' she remarked. 'I did not think the boy had such nice feeling in him. You understand, of course, what he has written to me about?' 'Oh, Aunt Harriet, has he told you?' burst out Winona. 'Oh, I'm so very, very glad! I've been longing and yearning to tell you all these years, only I couldn't, because I'd promised, and, oh, I must tell you now, I asked you about your will, and you thought I was horrid and scheming, but it wasn't that at all, it was that I thought you ought to know the will wasn't there, and hoped that perhaps you'd look! Oh, please believe me that I didn't mean to hint that you should leave anything to me! I don't want anything! You've been so good to me! I owe you a thousand times more than I can ever pay back. I've always wanted to make you understand this, but somehow I couldn't. Thank you, thank you, thank you for all you've done for me! I shall be better all my life for having lived with you and known you. I'm a different person since I came to Seaton, and I owe it entirely to you!' The barrier was down at last. For once Winona spoke straight from her heart. Miss Beach took off her pince-nez, wiped them, and put them in their case. Her hand was trembling. 'I wish I had known this before, child!' she said, with a break in her voice. 'Here for nearly two years I have been thinking hard things of you, and imagining that you were plotting and scheming to get my money. You hurt me beyond expression when you asked if I had made my will. As a matter of fact the document is safe at my lawyer's. The paper which Percy destroyed was only a rough draft. I had forgotten its existence.' 'But you do believe me?' urged Winona. 'You know I had none of those horrible plans? Oh, dear Aunt Harriet, money is nothing, nothing! It is you yourself I love, if you'll only let me!' And in the dusk of the garden, Winona, for the first time in her life, flung her warm young arms round her aunt and hugged her heartily. CHAPTER XXI The End of the Term 'Look here, my hearties!' said Winona to the cricket team. 'Do you realize that Seaton  versus  Binworth is on Wednesday week? If you don't, it's time you did, and you'd better buck up! My opinion of you at this present moment is that you're a set of loafers! What are you doing lounging about here, when you ought to be practicing for all you're worth?' The little group sitting on the grass under the lilac bushes smiled indulgently. 'Go ahead! Lay it on thick!' twittered Betty Carlisle. 'We knew when you hove into sight that we might expect some jaw-wag!' 'It's all very fine to sermonize,' yawned Maggie Allesley, 'but you'd oblige me very much by going indoors and inspecting the thermometer in the hall.' 'One can't tear about in this heat!' added Irene Swinburne. 'What a set of dainty Sybarites you are! No one would ever win matches if they waited for the right kind of day to practice. It's always too hot or too cold or too wet, or too something!' 'Well, to-day it's decidedly too something! Don't roast us!' 'But I shall roast you! D'you mean to let Binworth have a complete walk-over? I'll tell you what, if you can't or won't play during the heat, will you all come back to school for an hour every evening, and practice then? I'd square it up with Miss Bishop. I'm sure she wouldn't mind.' 'There's sense in your remarks now,' admitted Irene, sitting up. 'I'm game, if others are!' 'And so's this child!' agreed Betty Carlise. 'I can put the screw on Cassie and Nell, and bring them along any evening.' 'Then mind you do! I'm going to take an oath of the whole team to meet here at seven each night. I shall write it down on a piece of paper, and make you all put your names to it, like signing the pledge.' 'Right you are, O She-who-must-be-obeyed!' 'Your humble servants, Ma'am!' Their Captain's suggestion of an evening cricket practice was welcomed by the team, and approved by Miss Bishop. It was delightfully cool at seven o'clock; the girls, instead of being languid and half-hearted, were energetic and enthusiastic, and their play became a different matter altogether. Winona, who had been decidedly down about the prospects of the match, began to feel more confidence. Betty's bowling was improving daily, and Irene, who had been given to blind swiping, was gaining discretion. If they would continue to make progress at the same rate, Seaton would have a chance. 'It would be too bad if we lost the last match of the season!' fluttered Winona. 'While I'm your captain I want to break the record.' 'All right, old girl! It shall be a kind of Charge of the Light Brigade. 'Theirs but to do or die!' It will probably be a broiling hot day, but we'll play till we drop!' Betty assured her. 'Only have the Ambulance Corps ready with fans and stretchers to revive us and bear us from the field!' added Irene, giggling. 'I'll see there's lemonade for you!' Though to Winona, as Games Captain, 'Seaton  v.  Binworth' seemed the one event worth living for, there were plenty of other interests going on in the school. Linda Fletcher, the head girl, was arranging a program for the Parents' Afternoon, the efficient performance of which was, in her eyes, of infinitely greater public importance than the cricket match. She also required numerous rehearsals, and the conflicting claims on the girls' time became so confusing that after one or two struggles between rival 'whips,' who contended hotly for possession, the chiefs were obliged to strike a bargain, Winona releasing two members of the team in order that they might act, and filling up their places from her reserve, while Linda undertook to leave the rest of the eleven out of her calculations. After this there was peace, and Violet Agnew and Averil Walmer, who had been secretly burning to distinguish themselves in the dramatic line in preference to athletics, could meet Winona with clear consciences. Among other items of the program, Linda had fixed upon a French Pastoral Play, which was to be acted in the garden among the trees and lilac bushes. The girls were really supposed to get up the whole of the little entertainment by themselves, but Mademoiselle was kind in this instance, and helped to coach them. The scene was to be a Fête Champêtre, and the costumes were to be copied from some of Watteau's pictures. There were tremendous consultations over them. A dressmaking Bee was held every afternoon from four to five o'clock in the small lecture-room, Miss Bishop generously lending her sewing machine for the purpose. Here a band of willing workers sat and stitched and chattered and laughed and ate chocolates, while pretty garments grew rapidly under their fingers. The dresses were only made of cheap materials, and were hastily put together, but they had a very good effect, for the colors were gay, and the style, with its panniers and lace frills was charming. The girls would hardly have managed the cutting out quite unaided, had not Miss Lever offered her assistance. 'Dollikins' had large experience in the preparation of school theatricals, and possessed many invaluable paper patterns, so she was given a royal welcome, and installed at the table with the biggest and sharpest pair of scissors at her disposal. On the afternoon fixed for the entertainment quite a goodly audience assembled to watch and applaud. Mothers were in the majority, with a fair number of aunts and elder sisters, and just a sprinkling of fathers. Forms had been carried into the garden and arranged as an amateur theater, a flat piece of lawn with a background of bushes serving as stage. The program was to be representative of the whole school, so the first part was devoted to the performances of the Juniors. Twelve small damsels selected from Forms I. and II. gave a classic dance. They were dressed in Greek costume with sandals, and wore chaplets of roses round their hair. They had been carefully trained by Miss Barbour, the drill mistress, and went through their parts with a joyousness reminiscent of the Golden Age. The Morris Dance which followed, rendered by members of Forms III. and IV., though hardly so graceful, was sprightly and in good time, the fantastic dresses with their bells and ribbons suiting most of their wearers. It was felt that the Juniors had distinguished themselves, and 'Dollikins,' who with Miss Barbour had worked hard on their behalf, felt almost justified in bragging of their achievements. Meantime the Seniors had been making ready, and presently from behind the bushes tripped forth a charming group of Louis XV. courtiers, pattering the prettiest of French remarks. Dorrie Pollack as Monsieur le Duc de Tourville was a model of gallantry in a feathered hat and stiff ringlets (the result of an agonizing night passed in tight knobby curl papers!), while Linda, as Madame la Comtesse, quite outdid herself in the depth of her curtseys, and the distinguished grace with which she extended her hand for her cavalier to kiss. Nora Wilson tripped over her sword in her excitement, and Violet Agnew forgot her part, and had to be prompted by Mademoiselle, who stood with the book behind a bush; but these were only minor accidents, and on the whole the scene passed off with flying colors, and greatly impressed the parents and aunts with the high stage of proficiency in the French language attained by the pupils of Seaton High School. Linda was so elated by the success of the afternoon that she sat up long after she ought to have been in bed that night, writing an account of the proceedings for the School Magazine. The manuscript, couched in antique language, was headed:         'YE SEATON CHRONICLE.         'Then whereas ye damsels at ye schule had laboured well and         diligently during many days at ye tasks set them by their         reverend elders, it seemed good to those that did govern to         appoint unto them a day to make merry and rejoice. Therefore did         they choose out certain among them, and arraying them in goodly         fashion, did charge them to dance, to instruments of music         before ye face of ye whole assembly of ye damsels, and likewise         of some of their kindred, ye which were gathered together. Then         did ye maids with no small skill tread ye dance, clad in fair         garments with gauds and ornaments of silver upon them, at ye         sight of which their kindred did raise cries of joy, and did         further make great ado with clapping of ye hands. And when ye         little maidens had duly presented their dances before ye         company, then did ye elder damosels give a goodly masque, being         decked forth in brave trappings, and speaking cunningly in ye         tongue of ye fair lande of France, wherein all who heard them         might well understand. And ye kindred and alle they that were         gathered together for to look upon them did in kindness and with         glad hearts commend them, and did of their charity vouchsafe to         say that ye like had not aforetime been witnessed at ye schule,         whereat ye maidens rejoiced greatly, as evenso it seemed unto         them a reward for their diligent labour.' 'We shall leave an account of our doings behind us,' said Linda to some of her friends in the Sixth, 'for the copies of the School Magazine are to be bound, and kept in the library for ever and a day. Future generations of girls will at least see our names and our Form photo, if they don't know anything else about us.' Winona was living for one event, the match with Binworth. This was not to take place on the playing grounds of either school, but on a very superior cricket ground hired for the occasion from a local club. Winona, as Secretary for Seaton, had made fullest arrangements, including the presence in the pavilion of a cheery little woman from a neighboring restaurant, who undertook the purveying of lemonade, ginger pop, cakes, and any fruit which might be obtainable for the occasion. Tickets of admission to the ground were issued and distributed throughout the school, public opinion deeming attendance almost compulsory. The team were inspected and criticized beforehand almost as the Roman gladiators used to be reviewed by their patrons. Winona was on the whole proud of her eleven. Though not up to the lofty standard at which she had aimed, she felt that they realized a very respectable degree of merit. The ground lay a few miles out of the city, and was reached as a rule by tramcar, but as the ordinary service would be utterly unable to cope with the large numbers who proposed going, special omnibuses and brakes had been put on for the occasion to accommodate the school, which turned out almost in full force to witness the show. Binworth also contributed its quota of spectators, so the stands of the cricket ground were rapidly filled. Winona had a short preliminary talk with Dora Evans, who commanded the rival team, and as soon as the clock in the pavilion pointed to 2.30 the Captains stood out to toss. 'Heads!' cried Winona. 'It's tails! Your choice!' 'We'll bat, then,' decreed Dora. Winona placed her field at once, and Dora, after a whispered word or two to her team, selected her first bats. One was a business-like looking girl who hummed a tune as she came, with ostentatious carelessness; the other, stout and dark, blinked her eyes nervously. It was manifestly impossible to judge their capacities beforehand. Betty Carlisle was to take the first over. She had a high overhand action, and sent the ball down the pitch at a good pace. Lottie Moir, the dark-haired damsel who faced the bowling, was cautious. She played the first ball respectfully back to the bowler. The next, being of good length, she played quietly to long-off for one. She was evidently not out to take risks, and the rest of the over she did not attempt to score. Her partner, Meg Perkins, was a fairly brilliant, but more reckless player. The first ball she received came down at a good pace, but well on the off-side of the wicket. A well-timed cut sent it flying to the short boundary for two. Perhaps the success turned her head a little. The next ball pitched well to the leg-side; she made a mighty stroke at it, not allowing for the break, and missed it altogether. Next moment she was walking ruefully back to the pavilion. Phyllis Knight, the next bat, was evidently regarded by the Binworth team as a champion. She was tall, and decidedly athletic looking. Winona nodded to Irene Swinburne, celebrated for her twisters, and Irene went on to bowl. Phyllis had a long reach, which she employed successfully in driving the first ball she received right along the ground into 'the country' for three. Seaton began to look rather glum. The next ball she stone-walled. Irene was growing desperate. Phyllis was waiting with her bat slightly raised. 'Now if only I can drop the ball just under that bat, out she goes!' said Irene to herself, and sent the swiftest she knew how. Phyllis made a slash at it, evidently thinking it a half volley, but alas! her bails flew, and the Seaton contingent were roaring 'Well bowled!' None of the rest of the Binworth team approached to Phyllis' standard, though they played with caution, and their score mounted up steadily. At the end of their innings sixty was up on the board. The Binworth Captain now arranged her field, and Winona sent in Bessie Kirk and Irene Swinburne to face the bowling of Meg Perkins at one end, and Phyllis Knight at the other. At first things did not go over well for Seaton. Bessie Kirk fell a victim to Meg's crafty slows. She played too soon at a short-pitched ball, and spooned a catch to mid-on. Irene at first scored merrily, but growing foolhardy was clean bowled by Phyllis Knight, to her huge discomfiture. Betty Carlisle and Maggie Allesley met with better luck, and the score began to creep up. The Seaton girls breathed more freely. Audrey Redfern and Lizzie Morris came up next. Lizzie broke her duck in the first over, and gaining confidence began to get her eye in, and with Audrey stone-walling with dogged persistence at the other end, and now and then making a single, the score reached fifty-three. There were only ten minutes left. Winona began to grow desperate. She came forth herself now, with a look of determination on her face. Dora Evans at once rolled the ball to Lottie Moir. Winona took her block composedly. Lottie might with advantage have been put on before. Her style, though by no means swift, was most awkward to play. Winona in the first over did not attempt to score. She wished to take the measure of her opponent. In the next over her partner made a single, which brought Winona to the opposite wicket. The first ball came well on the off-side, and she sent it flying to the boundary for four. Fifty-eight was now up on the board, and there were only five minutes left! Perhaps Lottie Moir was tired, or waxed a little careless. The next ball she sent down was an easy full pitch. Winona waited till just the right moment, and then, with a fine swing of her bat, sent the ball clean over the boundary for six. The match was won, and Seaton, in the ecstasy of victory, was cheering itself hoarse. 'I never thought we'd do it!' murmured Winona to Betty, as they drank ginger pop together in the pavilion. 'I reckoned our Captain wouldn't fail us!' chuckled Betty delightedly. 'Linda must compose an epic on it for the School Magazine. It beats Marathon, in my opinion!' 'Well, I'm glad my last match at the old 'High' has been a success, anyway!' 'Seaton  versus  Binworth' had taken place on Wednesday, and the school had scarcely finished exulting over its triumph before another matter claimed its attention. On Thursday morning the results of the examination arrived. Miss Bishop summoned the whole school into the lecture hall to hear the news. She was looking flushed and excited. She waited a few moments as if to give extra effect to her words, then announced: 'I have just received the results of the Entrance Examinations from Dunningham University. Out of twelve candidates who were entered from this school, ten have satisfied the examiners. Their names stand as follows in order of merit:                               FIRST CLASS.                               Garnet Emerson.                               SECOND CLASS.                               Linda Fletcher.                               Agatha James.                               Helena Maitland.                               Freda Long.                               THIRD CLASS.                               Mary Payne.                               Hilda Langley.                               Winona Woodward.                               Dorrie Pollack.                               Estelle Harrison.' Winona heaved an immense sigh of mingled amazement and relief. She had passed! Actually passed! She, Winona Woodward, whose form record had never soared above the most modest average. It was an unprecedented and altogether delightful finale to her school career. For the moment she could hardly believe that it was true. But Miss Bishop had not finished her speech; she held up her hand to stop the burst of clapping, and continued: 'As you are aware, the Governors of the School offered a three years' scholarship, tenable at Dunningham University, to whichever of the candidates should head the list, being not lower than second class. Garnet Emerson, who has secured a First Class, is therefore, at the desire of the Governors, awarded the scholarship. Now if you like to clap for her, you may do so!' That Garnet, her dear Garnet, should have won the coveted scholarship, put the coping-stone on Winona's glee. She squeezed her friend's hand afterwards in an ecstasy of congratulation. Garnet said little, so little that her enthusiastic chum was almost disappointed. Winona, judging by her own feelings, expected her to be at delirium point. Beatrice Howell and Olave Parry, the two candidates who had failed, were receiving condolences with chastened resignation, the rest were in various stages of jubilee. That evening, about six o'clock, a small packet was left at Abbey Close, directed to Miss Winona Woodward. She opened it eagerly. It held a small jewelers' box containing a beautiful little ring, and was accompanied by a letter from Garnet.         'DEAR WIN' (so the letter ran),, 'You must have thought         me slack this morning when you were congratulating me, but the         fact was I was utterly overwhelmed. I'd hoped and hoped to win         the scholarship, and then put the idea away, and when I knew my         good fortune I just felt stunned. It's all owing to you, for if         you hadn't helped me I could never, never even have passed. I         don't know how to thank you. Words are quite inadequate. But         will you believe that I shall never forget your kindness all the         rest of my life, and will you accept this little ring and wear         it for my sake? It is a garnet, and belonged to my grandmother,         after whom I was named. I value it greatly, but I would far         rather know you have it than keep it myself.                     'Always your most grateful friend,                                  'GARNET EMERSON.' There was a further surprise for Winona that evening. When supper was over, and she and Miss Beach were taking their usual twilight stroll round the garden, Aunt Harriet, who had been silent for a few minutes, suddenly spoke. 'I wish to say something to you, Winona. I'm very gratified indeed to hear that you have passed your college examinations. It has given me a better opinion of your capacity and perseverance than I possessed before. This result, combined with your conduct in coaching your friend through all these weeks, has decided me in a project that I was debating in my mind. I am going to send you either to a Physical Training College to qualify as a Games Mistress, or to a Horticultural College to prepare for a National Rural Economy diploma. Whichever career you decide to choose, I am resolved that you shall have the best training available.' 'Oh, Aunt Harriet! Thank you! Thank you! I don't deserve it!' faltered Winona. The end of the term had come at length. The next day was Winona's very last at Seaton High School. She was loth to leave, for the two years she had passed there had been the happiest and the fullest in her life. But though the past had pleasant memories, the future also held out fair hopes to her. As she entered Miss Bishop's study to say good-by, the head-mistress looked up kindly. 'I shall miss you, Winona. I have just been turning over your school record. It's not perhaps brilliant, but it has been persevering, and I am sure you've done your best. I am particularly pleased that you have passed your examination. As Games Captain you have been a decided asset to the school. I think I may safely say that you have justified the decision of the Governors in allowing you to hold the County Scholarship. Your aunt tells me that you are to go in either for Physical Training or Horticulture. Don't decide in a hurry. Get to know as much as you can about both, and think the matter over. Remember if ever you want a friend to come to me. Good-by!' Outside in the playground the Juniors were hanging about rather shyly and awkwardly. As Winona came from the dressing-room, Daisy James, much nudged by the others, advanced and thrust a little parcel into her hand. 'It's a present from us Juniors,' she said hurriedly. 'Please take it! It's not much, only a birthday book, but we've all written our names in it, so that you mayn't forget us. You've been so awfully good all the year in coaching us at hockey and cricket. I don't know what we're going to do without you when you've gone! Now, girls, are you ready? One, two, three!' And the ring of Juniors standing round shouted in one unanimous chorus: 'Three cheers for our Games Captain! Hip-hip-hooray!'                             SAVE THE WRAPPER!

A. L. BURT COMPANY, Publishers, 114-120 EAST 23rd STREET   NEW YORK CHAPTER I THE BEGINNING Philip Haldane and his sister lived in a little red-roofed house in a little red-roofed town. They had a little garden and a little balcony, and a little stable with a little pony in it, and a little cart for the pony to draw; a little canary hung in a little cage in the little bow-window, and the neat little servant kept everything as bright and clean as a little new pin. Philip had no one but his sister, and she had no one but Philip. Their parents were dead, and Helen, who was twenty years older than Philip and was really his half-sister, was all the mother he had ever known. And he had never envied other boys their mothers, because Helen was so kind and clever and dear. She gave up almost all her time to him; she taught him all the lessons he learned; she played with him, inventing the most wonderful new games and adventures. So that every morning when Philip woke he knew that he was waking to a new day of joyous and interesting happenings. And this went on till Philip was ten years old, and he had no least shadow of a doubt that it would go on for ever. The beginning of the change came one day when he and Helen had gone for a picnic to the wood where the waterfall was, and as they were driving back behind the stout old pony, who was so good and quiet that Philip was allowed to drive it. They were coming up the last lane before the turning where their house was, and Helen said: 'To-morrow we'll weed the aster bed and have tea in the garden.' 'Jolly,' said Philip, and they turned the corner and came in sight of their white little garden gate. And a man was coming out of it, a man who was not one of the friends they both knew. He turned and came to meet them. Helen put her hand on the reins, a thing which she had always taught Philip was  never  done, and the pony stopped. The man, who was, as Philip put it to himself, 'tall and tweedy,' came across in front of the pony's nose and stood close by the wheel on the side where Helen sat. She shook hands with him, and said, 'How do you do?' in quite the usual way. But after that they whispered. Whispered! And Philip knew how rude it is to whisper, because Helen had often told him this. He heard one or two words, 'at last,' and 'over now,' and 'this evening, then.' After that Helen said, 'This is my brother Philip,' and the man shook hands with him, across Helen, another thing which Philip knew was not manners, and said, 'I hope we shall be the best of friends.' Pip said, 'How do you do?' because that is the polite thing to say. But inside himself he said, 'I don't want to be friends with  you .' Then the man took off his hat and walked away, and Philip and his sister went home. She seemed different, somehow, and he was sent to bed a little earlier than usual, but he could not go to sleep for a long time, because he heard the front-door bell ring and afterwards a man's voice and Helen's going on and on in the little drawing-room under the room which was his bedroom. He went to sleep at last, and when he woke up in the morning it was raining, and the sky was grey and miserable. He lost his collar-stud, he tore one of his stockings as he pulled it on, he pinched his finger in the door, and he dropped his tooth-mug, with water in it too, and the mug was broken and the water went into his boots. There are mornings, you know, when things happen like that. This was one of them. Then he went down to breakfast, which tasted not quite so nice as usual. He was late, of course. The bacon fat was growing grey with waiting for him, as Helen said, in the cheerful voice that had always said all the things he liked best to hear. But Philip didn't smile. It did not seem the sort of morning for smiling, and the grey rain beat against the window. After breakfast Helen said, 'Tea in the garden is indefinitely postponed, and it's too wet for lessons.' That was one of her charming ideas, that wet days should not be made worse by lessons. 'What shall we do?' she said; 'shall we talk about the island? Shall I make another map of it? And put in all the gardens and fountains and swings?' The island was a favourite play. Somewhere in the warm seas where palm trees are, and rainbow-coloured sands, the island was said to be, their own island, beautified by their fancy with everything they liked and wanted, and Philip was never tired of talking about it. There were times when he almost believed that the island was real. He was king of the island and Helen was queen, and no one else was to be allowed on it. Only these two. But this morning even the thought of the island failed to charm. Philip straggled away to the window and looked out dismally at the soaked lawn and the dripping laburnum trees, and the row of raindrops hanging fat and full on the iron gate. 'What is it, Pippin?' Helen asked. 'Don't tell me you're going to have horrid measles, or red-hot scarlet fever, or noisy whooping-cough.' She came across and laid her hand on his forehead. 'Why, you're quite hot, boy of my heart. Tell sister, what is it?' ' You  tell  me ,' said Philip slowly. 'Tell you what, Pip?' 'You think you ought to bear it alone, like in books, and be noble and all that. But you  must  tell me; you promised you'd never have any secrets from me, Helen, you know you did.' Helen put her arm round him and said nothing. And from her silence Pip drew the most desperate and harrowing conclusions. The silence lasted. The rain gurgled in the water-pipe and dripped on the ivy. The canary in the green cage that hung in the window put its head on one side and tweaked a seed husk out into Philip's face, then twittered defiantly. But his sister said nothing. 'Don't,' said Philip suddenly, 'don't break it to me; tell me straight out.' 'Tell you what?' she said again. 'What is it?' he said. ' I  know how these unforetold misfortunes happen. Some one always comes, and then it's broken to the family.' ' What  is?' she asked. 'The misfortune,' said Philip breathlessly. 'Oh, Helen, I'm not a baby. Do tell me! Have we lost our money in a burst bank? Or is the landlord going to put bailiffs into our furniture? Or are we going to be falsely accused about forgery, or being burglars?' All the books Philip had ever read worked together in his mind to produce these melancholy suggestions. Helen laughed, and instantly felt a stiffening withdrawal of her brother from her arm. 'No, no, my Pippin, dear,' she made haste to say. 'Nothing horrid like that has happened.' 'Then what is it?' he asked, with a growing impatience that felt like a wolf gnawing inside him. 'I didn't want to tell you all in a hurry like this,' she said anxiously; 'but don't you worry, my boy of boys. It's something that makes me very happy. I hope it will you, too.' He swung round in the circling of her arm and looked at her with sudden ecstasy. 'Oh, Helen, dear, I know! Some one has left you a hundred thousand pounds a year, some one you once opened a railway-carriage door for, and now I can have a pony of my very own to ride. Can't I?' 'Yes,' said Helen slowly, 'you can have a pony; but nobody's left me anything. Look here, my Pippin,' she added, very quickly, 'don't ask any more questions. I'll tell you. When I was quite little like you I had a dear friend I used to play with all day long, and when we grew up we were friends still. He lived quite near us. And then he married some one else. And then the some one died. And now he wants me to marry him. And he's got lots of horses and a beautiful house and park,' she added. 'And where shall I be?' he asked. 'With me, of course, wherever I am.' 'It won't be just us two any more, though,' said Philip, 'and you said it should be, for ever and ever.' 'But I didn't know then, Pip, dear. He's been wanting me so long, , ' 'Don't  I  want you?' said Pip to himself. 'And he's got a little girl that you'll like so to play with,' she went on. 'Her name's Lucy, and she's just a year younger than you. And you'll be the greatest friends with her. And you'll both have ponies to ride, and, , ' 'I hate her,' cried Philip, very loud, 'and I hate him, and I hate their beastly ponies. And I hate  you !' And with these dreadful words he flung off her arm and rushed out of the room, banging the door after him, on purpose. Well, she found him in the boot-cupboard, among the gaiters and goloshes and cricket-stumps and old rackets, and they kissed and cried and hugged each other, and he said he was sorry he had been naughty. But in his heart that was the only thing he was sorry for. He was sorry that he had made Helen unhappy. He still hated 'that man,' and most of all he hated Lucy. He had to be polite to that man. His sister was very fond of that man, and this made Philip hate him still more, while at the same time it made him careful not to show how he hated him. Also it made him feel that hating that man was not quite fair to his sister, whom he loved. But there were no feelings of that kind to come in the way of the detestation he felt for Lucy. Helen had told him that Lucy had fair hair and wore it in two plaits; and he pictured her to himself as a fat, stumpy little girl, exactly like the little girl in the story of 'The Sugar Bread' in the old oblong 'Shock-Headed Peter' book that had belonged to Helen when she was little. Helen was quite happy. She divided her love between the boy she loved and the man she was going to marry, and she believed that they were both as happy as she was. The man, whose name was Peter Graham, was happy enough; the boy, who was Philip, was amused, for she kept him so, but under the amusement he was miserable. And the wedding-day came and went. And Philip travelled on a very hot afternoon by strange trains and a strange carriage to a strange house, where he was welcomed by a strange nurse and, Lucy. 'You won't mind going to stay at Peter's beautiful house without me, will you, dear?' Helen had asked. 'Every one will be kind to you, and you'll have Lucy to play with.' And Philip said he didn't mind. What else could he say, without being naughty and making Helen cry again? Lucy was not a bit like the Sugar-Bread child. She had fair hair, it is true, and it was plaited in two braids, but they were very long and straight; she herself was long and lean and had a freckled face and bright, jolly eyes. 'I'm so glad you've come,' she said, meeting him on the steps of the most beautiful house he had ever seen; 'we can play all sort of things now that you can't play when you're only one. I'm an only child,' she added, with a sort of melancholy pride. Then she laughed. ''Only' rhymes with 'lonely,' doesn't it?' she said. 'I don't know,' said Philip, with deliberate falseness, for he knew quite well. He said no more. Lucy tried two or three other beginnings of conversation, but Philip contradicted everything she said. 'I'm afraid he's very very stupid,' she said to her nurse, an extremely trained nurse, who firmly agreed with her. And when her aunt came to see her next day, Lucy said that the little new boy was stupid, and disagreeable as well as stupid, and Philip confirmed this opinion of his behaviour to such a degree that the aunt, who was young and affectionate, had Lucy's clothes packed at once and carried her off for a few days' visit. So Philip and the nurse were left at the Grange. There was nobody else in the house but servants. And now Philip began to know what loneliness meant. The letters and the picture post-cards which his sister sent every day from the odd towns on the continent of Europe, which she visited on her honeymoon, did not cheer the boy. They merely exasperated him, reminding him of the time when she was all his own, and was too near to him to need to send him post-cards and letters. The extremely trained nurse, who wore a grey uniform and white cap and apron, disapproved of Philip to the depths of her well-disciplined nature. 'Cantankerous little pig,' she called him to herself. To the housekeeper she said, 'He is an unusually difficult and disagreeable child. I should imagine that his education has been much neglected. He wants a tight hand.' She did not use a tight hand to him, however. She treated him with an indifference more annoying than tyranny. He had immense liberty of a desolate, empty sort. The great house was his to go to and fro in. But he was not allowed to touch anything in it. The garden was his, to wander through, but he must not pluck flowers or fruit. He had no lessons, it is true; but, then, he had no games either. There was a nursery, but he was not imprisoned in it, was not even encouraged to spend his time there. He was sent out for walks, and alone, for the park was large and safe. And the nursery was the room of all that great house that attracted him most, for it was full of toys of the most fascinating kind. A rocking-horse as big as a pony, the finest dolls' house you ever saw, boxes of tea-things, boxes of bricks, both the wooden and the terra-cotta sorts, puzzle maps, dominoes, chessmen, draughts, every kind of toy or game that you have ever had or ever wished to have. And Pip was not allowed to play with any of them. 'You mustn't touch anything, if you please,' the nurse said, with that icy politeness which goes with a uniform. 'The toys are Miss Lucy's. No; I couldn't be responsible for giving you permission to play with them. No; I couldn't think of troubling Miss Lucy by writing to ask her if you may play with them. No; I couldn't take upon myself to give you Miss Lucy's address.' For Philip's boredom and his desire had humbled him even to the asking for this. For two whole days he lived at the Grange, hating it and every one in it; for the servants took their cue from the nurse, and the child felt that in the whole house he had not a friend. Somehow he had got the idea firmly in his head that this was a time when Helen was not to be bothered about anything; so he wrote to her that he was quite well, thank you, and the park was very pretty and Lucy had lots of nice toys. He felt very brave and noble, and like a martyr. And he set his teeth to bear it all. It was like spending a few days at the dentist's. And then suddenly everything changed. The nurse got a telegram. A brother who had been thought to be drowned at sea had abruptly come home. She must go to see him. 'If it costs me the situation,' she said to the housekeeper, who answered: 'Oh, well, go, then. I'll be responsible for the boy, sulky little brat.' And the nurse went. In a happy bustle she packed her boxes and went. At the last moment Philip, on the doorstep watching her climb into the dog-cart, suddenly sprang forward. 'Oh, Nurse!' he cried, blundering against the almost moving wheel, and it was the first time he had called her by any name. 'Nurse, do, do say I may take Lucy's toys to play with; it  is  so lonely here. I may, mayn't I? I may take them?' Perhaps the nurse's heart was softened by her own happiness and the thought of the brother who was not drowned. Perhaps she was only in such a hurry that she did not know what she was saying. At any rate, when Philip said for the third time, 'May I take them?' she hastily answered: 'Bless the child! Take anything you like. Mind the wheel, for goodness' sake. Good-bye, everybody!' waved her hand to the servants assembled at the top of the wide steps, and was whirled off to joyous reunion with the undrowned brother. Philip drew a deep breath of satisfaction, went straight up to the nursery, took out all the toys, and examined every single one of them. It took him all the afternoon. The next day he looked at all the things again and longed to make something with them. He was accustomed to the joy that comes of making things. He and Helen had built many a city for the dream island out of his own two boxes of bricks and certain other things in the house, her Japanese cabinet, the dominoes and chessmen, cardboard boxes, books, the lids of kettles and teapots. But they had never had enough bricks. Lucy had enough bricks for anything. He began to build a city on the nursery table. But to build with bricks alone is poor work when you have been used to building with all sorts of other things. 'It looks like a factory,' said Philip discontentedly. He swept the building down and replaced the bricks in their different boxes. 'There must be something downstairs that would come in useful,' he told himself, 'and she did say, 'Take what you like.'' By armfuls, two and three at a time, he carried down the boxes of bricks and the boxes of blocks, the draughts, the chessmen, and the box of dominoes. He took them into the long drawing-room where the crystal chandeliers were, and the chairs covered in brown holland, and the many long, light windows, and the cabinets and tables covered with the most interesting things. He cleared a big writing-table of such useless and unimportant objects as blotting-pad, silver inkstand, and red-backed books, and there was a clear space for his city. He began to build. A bronze Egyptian god on a black and gold cabinet seemed to be looking at him from across the room. 'All right,' said Philip. 'I'll build you a temple. You wait a bit.' The bronze god waited and the temple grew, and two silver candlesticks, topped by chessmen, served admirably as pillars for the portico. He made a journey to the nursery to fetch the Noah's Ark animals, the pair of elephants, each standing on a brick, flanked the entrance. It looked splendid, like an Assyrian temple in the pictures Helen had shown him. But the bricks, wherever he built with them alone, looked mean, and like factories or workhouses. Bricks alone always do. Philip explored again. He found the library. He made several journeys. He brought up twenty-seven volumes bound in white vellum with marbled boards, a set of Shakespeare, ten volumes in green morocco. These made pillars and cloisters, dark, mysterious, and attractive. More Noah's Ark animals added an Egyptian-looking finish to the building. 'Lor', ain't it pretty!' said the parlour-maid, who came to call him to tea. 'You are clever with your fingers, Master Philip, I will say that for you. But you'll catch it, taking all them things.' 'That grey nurse said I might,' said Philip, 'and it doesn't hurt things building with them. My sister and I always did it at home,' he added, looking confidingly at the parlour-maid. She had praised his building. And it was the first time he had mentioned his sister to any one in that house. 'Well, it's as good as a peep-show,' said the parlour-maid; 'it's just like them picture post-cards my brother in India sends me. All them pillars and domes and things, and the animals too. I don't know how you fare to think of such things, that I don't.' [Illustration: 'Lor', ain't it pretty!' said the parlour-maid.] Praise is sweet. He slipped his hand into that of the parlour-maid as they went down the wide stairs to the hall, where tea awaited him, a very little tray on a very big, dark table. 'He's not half a bad child,' said Susan at her tea in the servants' quarters. 'That nurse frightened him out of his little wits with her prim ways, you may depend. He's civil enough if you speak him civil.' 'But Miss Lucy didn't frighten him, I suppose,' said the cook; 'and look how he behaved to her.' 'Well, he's quiet enough, anyhow. You don't hear a breath of him from morning till night,' said the upper housemaid; 'seems silly-like to me.' 'You slip in and look what he's been building, that's all,' Susan told them. 'You won't call him silly then. India an' pagodas ain't in it.' They did slip in, all of them, when Philip had gone to bed. The building had progressed, though it was not finished. 'I shan't touch a thing,' said Susan. 'Let him have it to play with to-morrow. We'll clear it all away before that nurse comes back with her caps and her collars and her stuck-up cheek.' So next day Philip went on with his building. He put everything you can think of into it: the dominoes, and the domino-box; bricks and books; cotton-reels that he begged from Susan, and a collar-box and some cake-tins contributed by the cook. He made steps of the dominoes and a terrace of the domino-box. He got bits of southernwood out of the garden and stuck them in cotton-reels, which made beautiful pots, and they looked like bay trees in tubs. Brass finger-bowls served for domes, and the lids of brass kettles and coffee-pots from the oak dresser in the hall made minarets of dazzling splendour. Chessmen were useful for minarets, too. 'I must have paved paths and a fountain,' said Philip thoughtfully. The paths were paved with mother-of-pearl card counters, and the fountain was a silver and glass ash-tray, with a needlecase of filigree silver rising up from the middle of it; and the falling water was made quite nicely out of narrow bits of the silver paper off the chocolate Helen had given him at parting. Palm trees were easily made, Helen had shown him how to do that, with bits of larch fastened to elder stems with plasticine. There was plenty of plasticine among Lucy's toys; there was plenty of everything. And the city grew, till it covered the table. Philip, unwearied, set about to make another city on another table. This had for chief feature a great water-tower, with a fountain round its base; and now he stopped at nothing. He unhooked the crystal drops from the great chandeliers to make his fountains. This city was grander than the first. It had a grand tower made of a waste-paper basket and an astrologer's tower that was a photograph-enlarging machine. The cities were really very beautiful. I wish I could describe them thoroughly to you. But it would take pages and pages. Besides all the things I have told of alone there were towers and turrets and grand staircases, pagodas and pavilions, canals made bright and water-like by strips of silver paper, and a lake with a boat on it. Philip put into his buildings all the things out of the doll's house that seemed suitable. The wooden things-to-eat and dishes. The leaden tea-cups and goblets. He peopled the place with dominoes and pawns. The handsome chessmen were used for minarets. He made forts and garrisoned them with lead soldiers. He worked hard and he worked cleverly, and as the cities grew in beauty and interestingness he loved them more and more. He was happy now. There was no time to be unhappy in. 'I will keep it as it is till Helen comes. How she will  love  it!' he said. The two cities were connected by a bridge which was a yard-stick he had found in the servants' sewing-room and taken without hindrance, for by this time all the servants were his friends. Susan had been the first, that was all. He had just laid his bridge in place, and put Mr. and Mrs. Noah in the chief square to represent the inhabitants, and was standing rapt in admiration of his work, when a hard hand on each of his shoulders made him start and scream. It was the nurse. She had come back a day sooner than any one expected her. The brother had brought home a wife, and she and the nurse had not liked each other; so she was very cross, and she took Philip by the shoulders and shook him, a thing which had never happened to him before. 'You naughty, wicked boy!' she said, still shaking. 'But I haven't hurt anything, I'll put everything back,' he said, trembling and very pale. 'You'll not touch any of it again,' said the nurse. 'I'll see to that. I shall put everything away myself in the morning. Taking what doesn't belong to you!' 'But you said I might take anything I liked,' said Philip, 'so if it's wrong it's your fault.' 'You untruthful child!' cried the nurse, and hit him over the knuckles. Now, no one had ever hit Philip before. He grew paler than ever, but he did not cry, though his hands hurt rather badly. For she had snatched up the yard-stick to hit him with, and it was hard and cornery. 'You are a coward,' said Philip, 'and it is you who are untruthful and not me.' 'Hold your tongue,' said the nurse, and whirled him off to bed. 'You'll get no supper, so there!' she said, angrily tucking him up. 'I don't want any,' said Philip, 'and I have to forgive you before the sun goes down.' 'Forgive, indeed!' said she, flouncing out. 'When you get sorry you'll know I've forgiven you,' Philip called after her, which, of course, made her angrier than ever. Whether Philip cried when he was alone is not our business. Susan, who had watched the shaking and the hitting without daring to interfere, crept up later with milk and sponge-cakes. She found him asleep, and she says his eyelashes were wet. When he awoke he thought at first that it was morning, the room was so light. But presently he saw that it was not yellow sunlight but white moonshine which made the beautiful brightness. He wondered at first why he felt so unhappy, then he remembered how Helen had gone away and how hateful the nurse had been. And now she would pull down the city and Helen would never see it. And he would never be able to build such a beautiful one again. In the morning it would be gone, and he would not be able even to remember how it was built. The moonlight was very bright. 'I wonder how my city looks by moonlight?' he said. And then, all in a thrilling instant, he made up his mind to go down and see for himself how it did look. He slipped on his dressing-gown, opened his door softly, and crept along the corridor and down the broad staircase, then along the gallery and into the drawing-room. It was very dark, but he felt his way to a window and undid the shutter, and there lay his city, flooded with moonlight, just as he had imagined it. He gazed on it for a moment in ecstasy and then turned to shut the door. As he did so he felt a slight strange giddiness and stood a moment with his hand to his head. He turned and went again towards the city, and when he was close to it he gave a little cry, hastily stifled, for fear some one should hear him and come down and send him to bed. He stood and gazed about him bewildered and, once more, rather giddy. For the city had, in a quick blink of light, followed by darkness, disappeared. So had the drawing-room. So had the chair that stood close to the table. He could see mountainous shapes raising enormous heights in the distance, and the moonlight shone on the tops of them. But he himself seemed to be in a vast, flat plain. There was the softness of long grass round his feet, but there were no trees, no houses, no hedges or fences to break the expanse of grass. It seemed darker in some parts than others. That was all. It reminded him of the illimitable prairie of which he had read in books of adventure. 'I suppose I'm dreaming,' said Philip, 'though I don't see how I can have gone to sleep just while I was turning the door handle. However, , ' He stood still expecting that something would happen. In dreams something always does happen, if it's only that the dream comes to an end. But nothing happened now, Philip just stood there quite quietly and felt the warm soft grass round his ankles. Then, as his eyes became used to the darkness of the plain, he saw some way off a very steep bridge leading up to a dark height on whose summit the moon shone whitely. He walked towards it, and as he approached he saw that it was less like a bridge than a sort of ladder, and that it rose to a giddy height above him. It seemed to rest on a rock far up against dark sky, and the inside of the rock seemed hollowed out in one vast dark cave. [Illustration: Beyond it he could see dim piles that looked like churches and houses.] And now he was close to the foot of the ladder. It had no rungs, but narrow ledges made hold for feet and hands. Philip remembered Jack and the Beanstalk, and looked up longingly; but the ladder was a very very long one. On the other hand, it was the only thing that seemed to lead anywhere, and he had had enough of standing lonely in the grassy prairie, where he seemed to have been for a very long time indeed. So he put his hands and feet to the ladder and began to go up. It was a very long climb. There were three hundred and eight steps, for he counted them. And the steps were only on one side of the ladder, so he had to be extremely careful. On he went, up and on, on and up, till his feet ached and his hands felt as though they would drop off for tiredness. He could not look up far, and he dared not look down at all. There was nothing for it but to climb and climb and climb, and at last he saw the ground on which the ladder rested, a terrace hewn in regular lines, and, as it seemed, hewn from the solid rock. His head was level with the ground, now his hands, now his feet. He leaped sideways from the ladder and threw himself face down on the ground, which was cold and smooth like marble. There he lay, drawing deep breaths of weariness and relief. There was a great silence all about, which rested and soothed, and presently he rose and looked around him. He was close to an archway with very thick pillars, and he went towards it and peeped cautiously in. It seemed to be a great gate leading to an open space, and beyond it he could see dim piles that looked like churches and houses. But all was deserted; the moonlight and he had the place, whatever it was, to themselves. 'I suppose every one's in bed,' said Philip, and stood there trembling a little, but very curious and interested, in the black shadow of the strange arch. CHAPTER II DELIVERER OR DESTROYER Philip stood in the shadow of the dark arch and looked out. He saw before him a great square surrounded by tall irregular buildings. In the middle was a fountain whose waters, silver in the moonlight, rose and fell with gentle plashing sound. A tall tree, close to the archway, cast the shadow of its trunk across the path, a broad black bar. He listened, listened, listened, but there was nothing to listen to, except the deep night silence and the changing soft sound the fountain made. His eyes, growing accustomed to the dimness, showed him that he was under a heavy domed roof supported on large square pillars, to the right and left stood dark doors, shut fast. 'I will explore these doors by daylight,' he said. He did not feel exactly frightened. But he did not feel exactly brave either. But he wished and intended to be brave, so he said, 'I will explore these doors. At least I think I will,' he added, for one must not only be brave but truthful. And then suddenly he felt very sleepy. He leaned against the wall, and presently it seemed that sitting down would be less trouble, and then that lying down would be more truly comfortable. A bell from very very far away sounded the hour, twelve. Philip counted up to nine, but he missed the tenth bell-beat, and the eleventh and the twelfth as well, because he was fast asleep cuddled up warmly in the thick quilted dressing-gown that Helen had made him last winter. He dreamed that everything was as it used to be before That Man came and changed everything and took Helen away. He was in his own little bed in his own little room in their own little house, and Helen had come to call him. He could see the sunlight through his closed eyelids, he was keeping them closed just for the fun of hearing her try to wake him, and presently he would tell her he had been awake all the time, and they would laugh together about it. And then he awoke, and he was not in his soft bed at home but on the hard floor of a big, strange gate-house, and it was not Helen who was shaking him and saying, 'Here, I say, wake up, can't you,' but a tall man in a red coat; and the light that dazzled his eyes was not from the sun at all, but from a horn lantern which the man was holding close to his face. 'What's the matter?' said Philip sleepily. 'That's the question,' said the man in red. 'Come along to the guard-room and give an account of yourself, you young shaver.' He took Philip's ear gently but firmly between a very hard finger and thumb. 'Leave go,' said Philip, 'I'm not going to run away.' And he stood up feeling very brave. The man shifted his hold from ear to shoulder and led Philip through one of those doors which he had thought of exploring by daylight. It was not daylight yet, and the room, large and bare, with an arch at each end and narrow little windows at the sides, was lighted by horn lanterns and tall tapers in pewter candlesticks. It seemed to Philip that the room was full of soldiers. Their captain, with a good deal of gold about him and a very smart black moustache, got up from a bench. 'Look what I've caught, sir,' said the man who owned the hand on Philip's shoulder. 'Humph,' said the captain, 'so it's really happened at last.' [Illustration: 'Here, I say, wake up, can't you?'] 'What has?' said Philip. 'Why, you have,' said the captain. 'Don't be frightened, little man.' 'I'm not frightened,' said Philip, and added politely, 'I should be so much obliged if you'd tell me what you mean.' He added something which he had heard people say when they asked the way to the market or the public gardens, 'I'm quite a stranger here,' he said. A jolly roar of laughter went up from the red-coats. 'It isn't manners to laugh at strangers,' said Philip. 'Mind your own manners,' said the captain sharply; 'in this country little boys speak when they're spoken to. Stranger, eh? Well, we knew that, you know!' Philip, though he felt snubbed, yet felt grand too. Here he was in the middle of an adventure with grown-up soldiers. He threw out his chest and tried to look manly. The captain sat down in a chair at the end of a long table, drew a black book to him, a black book covered with dust, and began to rub a rusty pen-nib on his sword, which was not rusty. 'Come now,' he said, opening the book, 'tell me how you came here. And mind you speak the truth.' 'I  always  speak the truth,' said Philip proudly. All the soldiers rose and saluted him with looks of deep surprise and respect. 'Well, nearly always,' said Philip, hot to the ears, and the soldiers clattered stiffly down again on to the benches, laughing once more. Philip had imagined there to be more discipline in the army. 'How did you come here?' said the captain. 'Up the great bridge staircase,' said Philip. The captain wrote busily in the book. 'What did you come for?' 'I didn't know what else to do. There was nothing but illimitable prairie, and so I came up.' 'You are a very bold boy,' said the captain. 'Thank you,' said Philip. 'I do  want  to be.' 'What was your purpose in coming?' 'I didn't do it on purpose, I just happened to come.' The captain wrote that down too. And then he and Philip and the soldiers looked at each other in silence. 'Well?' said the boy. 'Well?' said the captain. 'I do wish,' said the boy, 'you'd tell me what you meant by my really happening after all. And then I wish you'd tell me the way home.' 'Where do you want to get to?' asked the captain. 'The  address ,' said Philip, 'is The Grange, Ravelsham, Sussex.' 'Don't know it,' said the captain briefly, 'and anyhow you can't go back there now. Didn't you read the notice at the top of the ladder? Trespassers will be prosecuted. You've got to be prosecuted before you can go back anywhere.' 'I'd rather be persecuted than go down that ladder again,' he said. 'I suppose it won't be very bad, being persecuted, I mean?' His idea of persecution was derived from books. He thought it to be something vaguely unpleasant from which one escaped in disguise, adventurous and always successful. 'That's for the judges to decide,' said the captain, 'it's a serious thing trespassing in our city. This guard is put here expressly to prevent it.' 'Do you have many trespassers?' Philip asked. The captain seemed kind, and Philip had a great-uncle who was a judge, so the word judges made him think of tips and good advice, rather than of justice and punishment. 'Many trespassers indeed!' the captain almost snorted his answer. 'That's just it. There's never been one before. You're the first. For years and years and years there's been a guard here, because when the town was first built the astrologers foretold that some day there would be a trespasser who would do untold mischief. So it's our privilege, we're the Polistopolitan guards, to keep watch over the only way by which a trespasser could come in.' 'May I sit down?' said Philip suddenly, and the soldiers made room for him on the bench. 'My father and my grandfather and all my ancestors were in the guards,' said the captain proudly. 'It's a very great honour.' 'I wonder,' said Philip, 'why you don't cut off the end of your ladder, the top end I mean; then nobody could come up.' 'That would never do,' said the captain, 'because, you see, there's another prophecy. The great deliverer is to come that way.' 'Couldn't I,' suggested Philip shyly, 'couldn't I be the deliverer instead of the trespasser? I'd much rather, you know.' 'I daresay you would,' said the captain; 'but people can't be deliverers just because they'd much rather, you know.' 'And isn't any one to come up the ladder bridge except just those two?' 'We don't know; that's just it. You know what prophecies are.' 'I'm afraid I don't, exactly.' 'So vague and mixed up, I mean. The one I'm telling you about goes something like this.           Who comes up the ladder stair?             Beware, beware,           Steely eyes and copper hair           Strife and grief and pain to bear           All come up the ladder stair. You see we can't tell whether that means one person or a lot of people with steely eyes and copper hair.' 'My hair's just plain boy-colour,' said Philip; 'my sister says so, and my eyes are blue, I believe.' 'I can't see in this light;' the captain leaned his elbows on the table and looked earnestly in the boy's eyes. 'No, I can't see. The other prophecy goes:           From down and down and very far down           The king shall come to take his own;           He shall deliver the Magic town,           And all that he made shall be his own.           Beware, take care. Beware, prepare,           The king shall come by the ladder stair. 'How jolly,' said Philip; 'I love poetry. Do you know any more?' 'There are heaps of prophecies of course,' said the captain; 'the astrologers must do  something  to earn their pay. There's rather a nice one:           Every night when the bright stars blink           The guards shall turn out, and have a drink           As the clock strikes two.           And every night when no stars are seen           The guards shall drink in their own canteen           When the clock strikes two. To-night there aren't any stars, so we have the drinks served here. It's less trouble than going across the square to the canteen, and the principle's the same. Principle is the great thing with a prophecy, my boy.' 'Yes,' said Philip. And then the far-away bell beat again. One, two. And outside was a light patter of feet. A soldier rose, saluted his officer and threw open the door. There was a moment's pause; Philip expected some one to come in with a tray and glasses, as they did at his great-uncle's when gentlemen were suddenly thirsty at times that were not meal-times. But instead, after a moment's pause, a dozen greyhounds stepped daintily in on their padded cat-like feet; and round the neck of each dog was slung a roundish thing that looked like one of the little barrels which St. Bernard dogs wear round their necks in the pictures. And when these were loosened and laid on the table Philip was charmed to see that the roundish things were not barrels but cocoa-nuts. The soldiers reached down some pewter pots from a high shelf, pierced the cocoa-nuts with their bayonets and poured out the cocoa-nut milk. They all had drinks, so the prophecy came true, and what is more they gave Philip a drink as well. It was delicious, and there was as much of it as he wanted. I have never had as much cocoa-nut milk as I wanted. Have you? Then the hollow cocoa-nuts were tied on to the dogs' necks again and out they went, slim and beautiful, two by two, wagging their slender tails, in the most amiable and orderly way. 'They take the cocoa-nuts to the town kitchen,' said the captain, 'to be made into cocoa-nut ice for the army breakfast; waste not want not, you know. We don't waste anything here, my boy.' Philip had quite got over his snubbing. He now felt that the captain was talking with him as man to man. Helen had gone away and left him; well, he was learning to do without Helen. And he had got away from the Grange, and Lucy, and that nurse. He was a man among men. And then, just as he was feeling most manly and important, and quite equal to facing any number of judges, there came a little tap at the door of the guard-room, and a very little voice said: 'Oh, do please let me come in.' Then the door opened slowly. 'Well, come in, whoever you are,' said the captain. And the person who came in was, Lucy. Lucy, whom Philip thought he had got rid of, Lucy, who stood for the new hateful life to which Helen had left him. Lucy, in her serge skirt and jersey, with her little sleek fair pig-tails, and that anxious 'I-wish-we-could-be-friends' smile of hers. Philip was furious. It was too bad. 'And who is this?' the captain was saying kindly. 'It's me, it's Lucy,' she said. 'I came up with  him .' She pointed to Philip. 'No manners,' thought Philip in bitterness. 'No, you didn't,' he said shortly. 'I did, I was close behind you when you were climbing the ladder bridge. And I've been waiting alone ever since, when you were asleep and all. I  knew  he'd be cross when he knew I'd come,' she explained to the soldiers. 'I'm  not  cross,' said Philip very crossly indeed, but the captain signed to him to be silent. Then Lucy was questioned and her answers written in the book, and when that was done the captain said: 'So this little girl is a friend of yours?' 'No, she isn't,' said Philip violently; 'she's not my friend, and she never will be. I've seen her, that's all, and I don't want to see her again.' 'You  are  unkind,' said Lucy. And then there was a grave silence, most unpleasant to Philip. The soldiers, he perceived, now looked coldly at him. It was all Lucy's fault. What did she want to come shoving in for, spoiling everything? Any one but a girl would have known that a guard-room wasn't the right place for a girl. He frowned and said nothing. Lucy had smuggled up against the captain's knee, and he was stroking her hair. 'Poor little woman,' he said. 'You must go to sleep now, so as to be rested before you go to the Hall of Justice in the morning.' They made Lucy a bed of soldiers' cloaks laid on a bench; and bearskins are the best of pillows. Philip had a soldier's cloak and a bench, and a bearskin too, but what was the good? Everything was spoiled. If Lucy had not come the guard-room as a sleeping-place would have been almost as good as the tented field. But she  had  come, and the guard-room was no better now than any old night-nursery. And how had she known? How had she come? How had she made her way to that illimitable prairie where he had found the mysterious beginning of the ladder bridge? He went to sleep a bunched-up lump of prickly discontent and suppressed fury. When he woke it was bright daylight, and a soldier was saying, 'Wake up, Trespassers. Breakfast, , ' 'How jolly,' thought Philip, 'to be having military breakfast.' Then he remembered Lucy, and hated her being there, and felt once more that she had spoiled everything. I should not, myself, care for a breakfast of cocoa-nut ice, peppermint creams, apples, bread and butter and sweet milk. But the soldiers seemed to enjoy it. And it would have exactly suited Philip if he had not seen that Lucy was enjoying it too. 'I do hate greedy girls,' he told himself, for he was now in that state of black rage when you hate everything the person you are angry with does or says or is. And now it was time to start for the Hall of Justice. The guard formed outside, and Philip noticed that each soldier stood on a sort of green mat. When the order to march was given, each soldier quickly and expertly rolled up his green mat and put it under his arm. And whenever they stopped, because of the crowd, each soldier unrolled his green mat, and stood on it till it was time to go on again. And they had to stop several times, for the crowd was very thick in the great squares and in the narrow streets of the city. It was a wonderful crowd. There were men and women and children in every sort of dress. Italian, Spanish, Russian; French peasants in blue blouses and wooden shoes, workmen in the dress English working people wore a hundred years ago. Norwegians, Swedes, Swiss, Turks, Greeks, Indians, Arabians, Chinese, Japanese, besides Red Indians in dresses of skins, and Scots in kilts and sporrans. Philip did not know what nation most of the dresses belonged to, to him it was a brilliant patchwork of gold and gay colours. It reminded him of the fancy-dress party he had once been to with Helen, when he wore a Pierrot's dress and felt very silly in it. He noticed that not a single boy in all that crowd was dressed as he was, in what he thought was the only correct dress for boys. Lucy walked beside him. Once, just after they started, she said, 'Aren't you frightened, Philip?' and he would not answer, though he longed to say, 'Of course not. It's only girls who are afraid.' But he thought it would be more disagreeable to say nothing, so he said it. When they got to the Hall of Justice, she caught hold of his hand, and said: 'Oh!' very loud and sudden, 'doesn't it remind you of anything?' she asked. Philip pulled his hand away and said 'No' before he remembered that he had decided not to speak to her. And the 'No' was quite untrue, for the building did remind him of something, though he couldn't have told you what. The prisoners and their guard passed through a great arch between magnificent silver pillars, and along a vast corridor, lined with soldiers who all saluted. 'Do all sorts of soldiers salute you?' he asked the captain, 'or only just your own ones?' 'It's  you  they're saluting,' the captain said; 'our laws tell us to salute all prisoners out of respect for their misfortunes.' The judge sat on a high bronze throne with colossal bronze dragons on each side of it, and wide shallow steps of ivory, black and white. Two attendants spread a round mat on the top of the steps in front of the judge, a yellow mat it was, and very thick, and he stood up and saluted the prisoners. ('Because of your misfortunes,' the captain whispered.) The judge wore a bright yellow robe with a green girdle, and he had no wig, but a very odd-shaped hat, which he kept on all the time. The trial did not last long, and the captain said very little, and the judge still less, while the prisoners were not allowed to speak at all. The judge looked up something in a book, and consulted in a low voice with the crown lawyer and a sour-faced person in black. Then he put on his spectacles and said: 'Prisoners at the bar, you are found guilty of trespass. The punishment is Death, if the judge does not like the prisoners. If he does not dislike them it is imprisonment for life, or until the judge has had time to think it over. Remove the prisoners.' 'Oh,  don't !' cried Philip, almost weeping. 'I thought you weren't afraid,' whispered Lucy. 'Silence in court,' said the judge. Then Philip and Lucy were removed. They were marched by streets quite different from those they had come by, and at last in the corner of a square they came to a large house that was quite black. 'Here we are,' said the captain kindly. 'Good-bye. Better luck next time.' The gaoler, a gentleman in black velvet, with a ruff and a pointed beard, came out and welcomed them cordially. 'How do you do, my dears?' he said. 'I hope you'll be comfortable here. First-class misdemeanants, I suppose?' he asked. 'Of course,' said the captain. 'Top floor, if you please,' said the gaoler politely, and stood back to let the children pass. 'Turn to the left and up the stairs.' [Illustration: 'Top floor, if you please,' said the gaoler politely.] The stairs were dark and went on and on, and round and round, and up and up. At the very top was a big room, simply furnished with a table, chairs, and a rocking-horse. Who wants more furniture than that? 'You've got the best view in the whole city,' said the gaoler, 'and you'll be company for me. What? They gave me the post of gaoler because it's nice, light, gentlemanly work, and leaves me time for my writing. I'm a literary man, you know. But I've sometimes found it a trifle lonely. You're the first prisoners I've ever had, you see. If you'll excuse me I'll go and order some dinner for you. You'll be contented with the feast of reason and the flow of soul, I feel certain.' The moment the door had closed on the gaoler's black back Philip turned on Lucy. 'I hope you're satisfied,' he said bitterly. 'This is all  your  doing. They'd have let me off if you hadn't been here. What on earth did you want to come here for? Why did you come running after me like that? You know I don't like you?' 'You're the hatefullest, disagreeablest, horridest boy in all the world,' said Lucy firmly, 'there!' Philip had not expected this. He met it as well as he could. 'I'm not a little sneak of a white mouse squeezing in where I'm not wanted, anyhow,' he said. And then they stood looking at each other, breathing quickly, both of them. 'I'd rather be a white mouse than a cruel bully,' said Lucy at last. 'I'm not a bully,' said Philip. Then there was another silence. Lucy sniffed. Philip looked round the bare room, and suddenly it came to him that he and Lucy were companions in misfortune, no matter whose fault it was that they were imprisoned. So he said: 'Look here, I don't like you and I shan't pretend I do. But I'll call it Pax for the present if you like. We've got to escape from this place somehow, and I'll help you if you like, and you may help me if you can.' 'Thank you,' said Lucy, in a tone which might have meant anything. 'So we'll call it Pax and see if we can escape by the window. There might be ivy, or a faithful page with a rope ladder. Have you a page at the Grange?' 'There's two stable-boys,' said Lucy, 'but I don't think they're faithful, and I say, I think all this is much more magic than you think.' 'Of course I know it's magic,' said he impatiently; 'but it's quite real too.' 'Oh, it's real enough,' said she. They leaned out of the window. Alas, there was no ivy. Their window was very high up, and the wall outside, when they touched it with their hand, felt smooth as glass. ' That's  no go,' said he, and the two leaned still farther out of the window looking down on the town. There were strong towers and fine minarets and palaces, the palm trees and fountains and gardens. A white building across the square looked strangely familiar. Could it be like St. Paul's which Philip had been taken to see when he was very little, and which he had never been able to remember? No, he could not remember it even now. The two prisoners looked out in a long silence. Far below lay the city, its trees softly waving in the breeze, flowers shining in a bright many-coloured patchwork, the canals that intersected the big squares gleamed in the sunlight, and crossing and recrossing the squares and streets were the people of the town, coming and going about their business. 'Look here!' said Lucy suddenly, 'do you mean to say you don't know?' 'Know what?' he asked impatiently. 'Where we are. What it is. Don't you?' 'No. No more do you.' 'Haven't you seen it all before?' 'No, of course I haven't. No more have you.' 'All right. I  have  seen it before though,' said Lucy, 'and so have you. But I shan't tell you what it is unless you'll be nice to me.' Her tone was a little sad, but quite firm. 'I  am  nice to you. I told you it was Pax,' said Philip. 'Tell me what you think it is.' 'I don't mean that sort of grandish standoffish Pax, but real Pax. Oh, don't be so horrid, Philip. I'm dying to tell you, but I won't if you go on being like you are.' ' I'm  all right,' said Philip; 'out with it.' 'No. You've got to say it's Pax, and I will stand by you till we get out of this, and I'll always act like a noble friend to you, and I'll try my best to like you. Of course if you can't like me you can't, but you ought to try. Say it after me, won't you?' Her tone was so kind and persuading that he found himself saying after her, 'I, Philip, agree to try and like you, Lucy, and to stand by you till we're out of this, and always to act the part of a noble friend to you. And it's real Pax. Shake hands.' 'Now then,' said he when they had shaken hands, and Lucy uttered these words: 'Don't you see? It's your own city that we're in, your own city that you built on the tables in the drawing-room? It's all got big by magic, so that we could get in. Look,' she pointed out of the window, 'see that great golden dome, that's one of the brass finger-bowls, and that white building's my old model of St. Paul's. And there's Buckingham Palace over there, with the carved squirrel on the top, and the chessmen, and the blue and white china pepper-pots; and the building we're in is the black Japanese cabinet.' Philip looked and he saw that what she said was true. It  was  his city. 'But I didn't build insides to my buildings,' said he; 'and when did  you  see what I built anyway?' 'The insides are part of the magic, I suppose,' Lucy said; 'and I saw the cities you built when Auntie brought me home last night, after you'd been sent to bed. And I did love them. And oh, Philip, I'm so glad it's Pax because I do think you're so  frightfully  clever, and Auntie thought so too, building those beautiful things. And I knew nurse was going to pull it all down. I begged her not to, but she was addymant, and so I got up and dressed and came down to have another look by moonlight. And one or two of the bricks and chessmen had fallen down. I expect nurse knocked them down. So I built them up again as well as I could, and I was loving it all like anything; and then the door opened and I hid under the table, and you came in.' 'Then you were there, did you notice how the magic began?' 'No, but it all changed to grass; and then I saw you a long way off, going up a ladder. And so I went after you. But I didn't let you see me. I knew you'd be so cross. And then I looked in at the guard-room door, and I did so want some of the cocoa-nut milk.' 'When did you find out it was  my  city?' 'I thought the soldiers looked like my lead ones somehow. But I wasn't sure till I saw the judge. Why he's just old Noah, out of the Ark.' 'So he is,' cried Philip; 'how wonderful! How perfectly wonderful! I wish we weren't prisoners. Wouldn't it be jolly to go all over it, into all the buildings, to see what the insides of them have turned into? And all the other people. I didn't put  them  in.' 'That's more magic, I expect. But, Oh, we shall find it all out in time.' She clapped her hands. And on the instant the door opened and the gaoler appeared. 'A visitor for you,' he said, and stood aside to let some one else come in, some one tall and thin, with a black hooded cloak and a black half-mask, such as people wear at carnival time. When the gaoler had shut the door and gone away the tall figure took off its mask and let fall its cloak, showing to the surprised but recognising eyes of the children the well-known shape of Mr. Noah, the judge. 'How do you do?' he said. 'This is a little unofficial visit. I hope I haven't come at an inconvenient time.' 'We're very glad,' said Lucy, 'because you can tell us, , ' 'I won't answer questions,' said Mr. Noah, sitting down stiffly on his yellow mat, 'but I will tell you something. We don't know who you are. But I myself think that you may be the Deliverer.' 'Both of us,' said Philip jealously. 'One or both. You see the prophecy says that the Destroyer's hair is red. And your hair is not red. But before I could get the populace to feel sure of, that my own hair would be grey with thought and argument. Some people are so wooden-headed. And I am not used to thinking. I don't often have to do it. It distresses me.' The children said they were sorry. Philip added: 'Do tell us a little about your city. It isn't a question. We want to know if it's magic. That isn't a question either.' 'I was about to tell you,' said Mr. Noah, 'and I will not answer questions. Of course it is magic. Everything in the world is magic, until you understand it. 'And as to the city. I will just tell you a little of our history. Many thousand years ago all the cities of our country were built by a great and powerful giant, who brought the materials from far and wide. The place was peopled partly by persons of his choice, and partly by a sort of self-acting magic rather difficult to explain. As soon as the cities were built and the inhabitants placed here the life of the city began, and it was, to those who lived it, as though it had always been. The artisans toiled, the musicians played, and the poets sang. The astrologers, finding themselves in a tall tower evidently designed for such a purpose, began to observe the stars and to prophesy.' 'I know that part,' said Philip. 'Very well,' said the judge. 'Then you know quite enough. Now I want to ask a little favour of you both. Would you mind escaping?' 'If we only could,' Lucy sighed. 'The strain on my nerves is too much,' said Mr. Noah feelingly. 'Escape, my dear children, to please me, a very old man in indifferent health and poor spirits.' 'But how, , ' 'Oh, you just walk out. You, my boy, can disguise yourself in your dressing-gown which I see has been placed on yonder chair, and I will leave my cloak for you, little girl.' They both said 'Thank you,' and Lucy added: 'But  how ?' 'Through the door,' said the judge. 'There is a rule about putting prisoners on their honour not to escape, but there have not been any prisoners for so long that I don't suppose they put you on honour. No? You can just walk out of the door. There are many charitable persons in the city who will help to conceal you. The front-door key turns easily, and I myself will oil it as I go out. Good-bye, thank you so much for falling in with my little idea. Accept an old man's blessing. Only don't tell the gaoler. He would never forgive me.' He got off his mat, rolled it up and went. 'Well!' said Lucy. 'Well!' said Philip. 'I suppose we go?' he said. But Lucy said, 'What about the gaoler? Won't he catch it if we bolt?' Philip felt this might be true. It was annoying, and as bad as being put on one's honour. 'Bother!' was what he said. And then the gaoler came in. He looked pale and worried. 'I am so awfully sorry,' he began. 'I thought I should enjoy having you here, but my nerves are all anyhow. The very sound of your voices. I can't write a line. My brain reels. I wonder whether you'd be good enough to do a little thing for me? Would you mind escaping?' 'But won't you get into trouble?' 'Nothing could be worse than this,' said the gaoler, with feeling. 'I had no idea that children's voices were so penetrating. Go, go. I implore you to escape. Only don't tell the judge. I am sure he would never forgive me.' After that, what prisoner would not immediately have escaped? The two children only waited till the sound of the gaoler's keys had died away on the stairs, to open their door, run down the many steps and slip out of the prison gate. They walked a little way in silence. There were plenty of people about, but no one seemed to notice them. 'Which way shall we go?' Lucy asked. 'I wish we'd asked him where the Charitables live.' 'I think,' Philip began; but Lucy was not destined to know what he thought. There was a sudden shout, a clattering of horses' hoofs, and all the faces in the square turned their way. 'They've seen us,' cried Philip. 'Run, run, run!' He himself ran, and he ran toward the gate-house that stood at the top of the ladder stairs by which they had come up, and behind him came the shouting and clatter of hot pursuit. The captain stood in the gateway alone, and just as Philip reached the gate the captain turned into the guard-room and pretended not to see anything. Philip had never run so far or so fast. His breath came in deep sobs; but he reached the ladder and began quickly to go down. It was easier than going up. [Illustration: And behind him the clatter of hot pursuit.] He was nearly at the bottom when the whole ladder bridge leapt wildly into the air, and he fell from it and rolled in the thick grass of that illimitable prairie. All about him the air was filled with great sounds, like the noise of the earthquakes that destroy beautiful big palaces, and factories which are big but not beautiful. It was deafening, it was endless, it was unbearable. Yet he had to bear that, and more. And now he felt a curious swelling sensation in his hands, then in his head, then all over. It was extremely painful. He rolled over in his agony, and saw the foot of an enormous giant quite close to him. The foot had a large, flat, ugly shoe, and seemed to come out of grey, low-hanging, swaying curtains. There was a gigantic column too, black against the grey. The ladder bridge, cast down, lay on the ground not far from him. Pain and fear overcame Philip, and he ceased to hear or feel or know anything. When he recovered consciousness he found himself under the table in the drawing-room. The swelling feeling was over, and he did not seem to be more than his proper size. He could see the flat feet of the nurse and the lower part of her grey skirt, and a rattling and rumbling on the table above told him that she was doing as she had said she would, and destroying his city. He saw also a black column which was the leg of the table. Every now and then the nurse walked away to put back into its proper place something he had used in the building. And once she stood on a chair, and he heard the tinkling of the lustre-drops as she hooked them into their places on the chandelier. 'If I lie very still,' said he, 'perhaps she won't see me. But I do wonder how I got here. And what a dream to tell Helen about!' He lay very still. The nurse did not see him. And when she had gone to her breakfast Philip crawled out. Yes, the city was gone. Not a trace of it. The very tables were back in their proper places. Philip went back to his proper place, which, of course, was bed. 'What a splendid dream,' he said, as he cuddled down between the sheets, 'and now it's all over!' Of course he was quite wrong. CHAPTER III LOST Philip went to sleep, and dreamed that he was at home again and that Helen had come to his bedside to call him, leading a white pony that was to be his very own. It was a pony that looked clever enough for anything, and he was not surprised when it shook hands with him; but when it said, 'Well, we must be moving,' and began to try to put on Philip's shoes and stockings, Philip called out, 'Here, I say, stop that,' and awoke to a room full of sunshine, but empty of ponies. 'Oh, well,' said Philip, 'I suppose I'd better get up.' He looked at his new silver watch, one of Helen's parting presents, and saw that it marked ten o'clock. 'I say, you know,' said he to the watch, 'you can't be right.' And he shook it to encourage it to think over the matter. But the watch still said 'ten' quite plainly and unmistakably. Now the Grange breakfast time was at eight. And Philip was certain he had not been called. 'This is jolly rum,' he remarked. 'It must be the watch. Perhaps it's stopped.' But it hadn't stopped. Therefore it must be two hours past breakfast time. The moment he had thought this he became extremely hungry. He got out of bed as soon as he knew exactly how hungry he was. There was no one about, so he made his way to the bath-room and spent a happy hour with the hot water and the cold water, and the brown Windsor soap and the shaving soap and the nail brush and the flesh brush and the loofahs and the shower bath and the three sponges. He had not, so far, been able thoroughly to investigate and enjoy all these things. But now there was no one to interfere, and he enjoyed himself to that degree that he quite forgot to wonder why he hadn't been called. He thought of a piece of poetry that Helen had made for him, about the bath; and when he had done playing he lay on his back in water that was very hot indeed, trying to remember the poetry. The water was very nearly cold by the time he had remembered the poetry. It was called Dreams of a Giant Life, and this was it. DREAMS OF A GIANT LIFE           What was I once, in ages long ago?           I look back, and I see myself. We grow           So changed through changing years, I hardly see           How that which I look back on could be me?[1]           Glorious and splendid, giant-like I stood           On a white cliff, topped by a darkling wood.           Below me, placid, bright and sparkling, lay           The equal waters of a lovely bay.           White cliffs surrounded it, and calm and fair           It lay asleep, in warm and silent air.           I stood alone, naked and strong, upright           My limbs gleamed in the clear pure golden light.           I saw below me all the water lie           Expecting something, and that thing was I.[2]           I leaned, I plunged, the waves splashed over me.           I lay, a giant in a little sea.           White cliffs all round, wood-crowned, and as I lay           I saw the glories of the dying day;           No wind disturbed my sea; the sunlight was           As though it came through windows of gold glass.           The white cliffs rose above me, and around           The clear sea lay, pure, perfect and profound;           And I was master of the cliffs, the sea,           And the gold light that brightened over me.           Far miles away my giant feet showed plain,           Rising, like rocks out of the quiet main.           On them a lighthouse could be built, to show           Wayfaring ships the way they must not go.           I was the master of that cliff-girt sea.           I splashed my hands, the waves went over me,           And in the dimples of my body lay           Little rock-pools, where small sea-beasts might play.           I found a boat, its deck was perforate;           I launched it, and it dared the storms of fate.           Its woollen sail stood out against the sky,           Supported by a mast of ivory.           Another boat rode proudly to my hand,           Upon its deck a thousand spears did stand;           I launched it, and it sped full fierce and fast           Against the boat that had the ivory mast           And woollen sail and perforated deck.           The two went down in one stupendous wreck!           Beneath the waves I chased with joyous hand           Upon the bed of an imagined sand           The slippery brown sea mouse, that still escaped,           Where the deep cave beneath my knee was shaped.           Caught it at last and caged it into rest           Upon the shallows of my submerged breast.           Then, as I lay, wrapped as in some kind arm           By the sweet world of waters soft and warm,           A great voice cried, from some far unseen shore,           And I was not a giant any more.           'Come out, come out,' cried out the voice of power,           'You've been in for a quarter of an hour.           The water's cold, come, Master Pip, your head           'S all wet, and it is time you were in bed.'           I rose all dripping from the magic sea           And left the ships that had been slaves to me,            The soap-dish, with its perforated deck,           The nail-brush, that had rushed to loss and wreck,           The flannel sail, the tooth-brush that was mast,           The sleek soap-mouse, I left them all at last.           I went out of that magic sea and cried           Because the time came when I must be dried           And leave the splendour of a giant's joy           And go to bed, a little well-washed boy. FOOTNOTES: [1] Never mind grammar. [2] This is correct grammar, but never mind. When he had quite remembered the poetry he had another shower-bath, and then when he had enjoyed the hot rough towels out of the hot cupboard he went back to his room to dress. He now felt how deeply he wanted his breakfast, so he dressed himself with all possible speed, even forgetting to fasten his bootlaces properly. He was in such a hurry that he dropped his collar-stud, and it was as he stooped to pick it up that he remembered his dream. Do you know that was really the first time he had thought of it. The dream, that indeed would be something to think about. Breakfast was the really important thing. He went down very hungry indeed. 'I shall ask for my breakfast directly I get down,' he said. 'I shall ask the first person I meet.' And he met no one. There was no one on the stairs, or in the hall, or in the dining-room, or in the drawing-room. The library and billiard-room were empty of living people, and the door of the nursery was locked. So then Philip made his way into the regions beyond the baize door, where the servants' quarters were. And there was no one in the kitchen, or in the servants' hall, or in the butler's pantry, or in the scullery, or the washhouse, or the larder. In all that big house, and it was much bigger than it looked from the front because of the long wings that ran out on each side of its back, in all that big house there was no one but Philip. He felt certain of this before he ran upstairs and looked in all the bedrooms and in the little picture gallery and the music-room, and then in the servants' bedrooms and the very attics. There were interesting things in those attics, but Philip only remembered that afterwards. Now he tore down the stairs three at a time. All the room doors were open as he had left them, and somehow those open doors frightened him more than anything else. He ran along the corridors, down more stairs, past more open doors and out through the back kitchen, along the moss-grown walk by the brick wall and so round by the three yew trees and the mounting block to the stable-yard. And there was no one there. Neither coachman nor groom nor stable-boys. And there was no one in the stables, or the coach-house, or the harness-room, or the loft. Philip felt that he could not go back into the house. Something terrible must have happened. Was it possible that any one could want the Grange servants enough to kidnap them? Philip thought of the nurse and felt that, at least as far as she was concerned, it was  not  possible. Or perhaps it was magic! A sort of Sleeping-Beauty happening! Only every one had vanished instead of just being put to sleep for a hundred years. He was alone in the middle of the stable-yard when the thought came to him. 'Perhaps they're only made invisible. Perhaps they're all here and watching me and making fun of me.' He stood still to think this. It was not a pleasant thought. Suddenly he straightened his little back, and threw back his head. 'They shan't see I'm frightened anyway,' he told himself. And then he remembered the larder. 'I haven't had any breakfast,' he explained aloud, so as to be plainly heard by any invisible people who might be about. 'I ought to have my breakfast. If nobody gives it to me I shall take my breakfast.' He waited for an answer. But none came. It was very quiet in the stable-yard. Only the rattle of a halter ring against a manger, the sound of a hoof on stable stones, the cooing of pigeons and the rustle of straw in the loose-box broke the silence. 'Very well,' said Philip. 'I don't know what  you  think I ought to have for breakfast, so I shall take what  I  think.' He drew a long breath, trying to draw courage in with it, threw back his shoulders more soldierly than ever, and marched in through the back door and straight to the larder. Then he took what he thought he ought to have for breakfast. This is what he thought:           1 cherry pie,           2 custards in cups,           1 cold sausage,           2 pieces of cold toast,           1 piece of cheese,           2 lemon cheese-cakes,           1 small jam tart (there was only one left),           Butter, 1 pat. 'What jolly things the servants have to eat,' he said. 'I never knew. I thought that nothing but mutton and rice grew here.' He put all the food on a silver tray and carried it out on to the terrace, which lies between the two wings at the back of the house. Then he went back for milk, but there was none to be seen so he got a white jug full of water. The spoons he couldn't find, but he found a carving-fork and a fish-slice. Did you ever try to eat cherry pie with a fish-slice? 'Whatever's happened,' said Philip to himself, through the cherry pie, 'and whatever happens it's as well to have had your breakfast.' And he bit a generous inch off the cold sausage which he had speared with the carving-fork. And now, sitting out in the good sunshine, and growing less and less hungry as he plied fish-slice and carving-fork, his mind went back to his dream, which began to seem more and more real. Suppose it really  had  happened? It might have; magic things did happen, it seemed. Look how all the people had vanished out of the house, out of the world too, perhaps. 'Suppose every one's vanished,' said Philip. 'Suppose I'm the only person left in the world who hasn't vanished. Then everything in the world would belong to me. Then I could have everything that's in all the toy shops.' And his mind for a moment dwelt fondly on this beautiful idea. Then he went on. 'But suppose I vanished too? Perhaps if I were to vanish I could see the other people who have. I wonder how it's done.' He held his breath and tried hard to vanish. Have you ever tried this? It is not at all easy to do. Philip could not do it at all. He held his breath and he tried and he tried, but he only felt fatter and fatter and more and more as though in one more moment he should burst. So he let his breath go. 'No,' he said, looking at his hands; 'I'm not any more invisible than I was before. Not so much I think,' he added thoughtfully, looking at what was left of the cherry pie. 'But that dream, , ' He plunged deep in the remembrance of it that was, to him, like swimming in the waters of a fairy lake. He was hooked out of his lake suddenly by voices. It was like waking up. There, away across the green park beyond the sunk fence, were people coming. 'So every one hasn't vanished,' he said, caught up the tray and took it in. He hid it under the pantry shelf. He didn't know who the people were who were coming and you can't be too careful. Then he went out and made himself small in the shadow of a red buttress, heard their voices coming nearer and nearer. They were all talking at once, in that quick interested way that makes you certain something unusual has happened. He could not hear exactly what they were saying, but he caught the words: 'No.' 'Of course I've asked.' 'Police.' 'Telegram.' 'Yes, of course.' 'Better make quite sure.' Then every one began speaking all at once, and you could not hear anything that anybody said. Philip was too busy keeping behind the buttress to see who they were who were talking. He was glad  something  had happened. 'Now I shall have something to think about besides the nurse and my beautiful city that she has pulled down.' But what was it that had happened? He hoped nobody was hurt, or had done anything wrong. The word police had always made him uncomfortable ever since he had seen a boy no bigger than himself pulled along the road by a very large policeman. The boy had stolen a loaf, Philip was told. Philip could never forget that boy's face; he always thought of it in church when it said 'prisoners and captives,' and still more when it said 'desolate and oppressed.' 'I do hope it's not  that ,' he said. And slowly he got himself to leave the shelter of the red-brick buttress and to follow to the house those voices and those footsteps that had gone by him. He followed the sound of them to the kitchen. The cook was there in tears and a Windsor arm-chair. The kitchenmaid, her cap all on one side, was crying down most dirty cheeks. The coachman was there, very red in the face, and the groom, without his gaiters. The nurse was there, neat as ever she seemed at first, but Philip was delighted when a more careful inspection showed him that there was mud on her large shoes and on the bottom of her skirt, and that her dress had a large three-cornered tear in it. 'I wouldn't have had it happen for a twenty-pun note,' the coachman was saying. 'George,' said the nurse to the groom, 'you go and get a horse ready. I'll write the telegram.' 'You'd best take Peppermint,' said the coachman. 'She's the fastest.' The groom went out, saying under his breath, 'Teach your grandmother,' which Philip thought rude and unmeaning. Philip was standing unnoticed by the door. He felt that thrill, if it isn't pleasure it is more like it than anything else, which we all feel when something real has happened. But what  had  happened. What? 'I wish I'd never come back,' said the nurse. 'Then nobody could pretend it was  my  fault.' 'It don't matter what they pretend,' the cook stopped crying to say. 'The thing is what's happened. Oh, my goodness. I'd rather have been turned away without a character than have had this happen.' 'And I'd rather  any thing,' said the nurse. 'Oh, my goodness me. I wish I'd never been born.' And then and there, before the astonished eyes of Philip, she began to behave as any nice person might, she began to cry. 'It wouldn't have happened,' said the cook, 'if the master hadn't been away. He's a Justice of the Peace, he is, and a terror to gipsies. It wouldn't never have happened if, , ' Philip could not bear it any longer. ' What  wouldn't have happened if?' he asked, startling everybody to a quick jump of surprise. The nurse stopped crying and turned to look at him. 'Oh,  you !' she said slowly. 'I forgot  you . You want your breakfast, I suppose, no matter what's happened?' 'No, I don't,' said Philip, with extreme truth. 'I want to know what  has  happened?' 'Miss Lucy's lost,' said the cook heavily, 'that's what's happened. So now you know. You run along and play, like a good little boy, and don't make extry trouble for us in the trouble we're in.' 'Lost?' repeated Philip. 'Yes, lost. I expect you're glad,' said the nurse, 'the way you treated her. You hold your tongue and don't let me so much as hear you breathe the next twenty-four hours. I'll go and write that telegram.' Philip thought it best not to let any one hear him breathe. By this means he heard the telegram when nurse read it aloud to the cook.           'Peter Graham, Esq.,                       Hotel Wagram,                                Brussels.           Miss Lucy lost. Please come home immediately.                                                PHILKINS. That's all right, isn't it?' 'I don't see why you sign it Philkins. You're only the nurse, I'm the head of the house when the family's away, and my name's Bobson,' the cook said. There was a sound of torn paper. 'There, the paper's tore. I'd just as soon your name went to it,' said the nurse. 'I don't want to be the one to tell such news.' 'Oh, my good gracious, what a thing to happen,' sighed the cook. 'Poor little darling!' Then somebody wrote the telegram again, and the nurse took it out to the stable-yard, where Peppermint was already saddled. 'I thought,' said Philip, bold in the nurse's absence, 'I thought Lucy was with her aunt.' 'She came back yesterday,' said the cook. 'Yes, after you'd gone to bed. And this morning that nurse went into the night nursery and she wasn't there. Her bed all empty and cold, and her clothes gone. Though how the gipsies could have got in without waking that nurse is a mystery to me and ever will be. She must sleep like a pig.' 'Or the seven sleepers,' said the coachman. 'But what would gipsies want her  for ?' Philip asked. 'What do they ever want anybody for?' retorted the cook. 'Look at the heirs that's been stolen. I don't suppose there's a titled family in England but what's had its heir stolen, one time and another.' 'I suppose you've looked all over the house,' said Philip. 'I suppose we ain't deaf and dumb and blind and silly,' said the cook. 'Here's that nurse. You be off, Mr. Philip, without you want a flea in your ear.' And Philip, at the word,  was  off. He went into the long drawing-room, and shut the door. Then he got the ivory chessmen out of the Buhl cabinet, and set them out on that delightful chess-table whose chequers are of mother-of-pearl and ivory, and tried to play a game, right hand against left. But right hand, who was white, and so moved first, always won. He gave up after awhile, and put the chessmen away in their proper places. Then he got out the big book of photographs of pictures, but they did not seem interesting, so he tried the ivory spellicans. But his hand shook, and you know spellicans is a game you can't play when your hand shakes. And all the time, behind the chess and the pictures and the spellicans, he was trying not to think about his dream, about how he had climbed that ladder stair, which was really the yard-stick, and gone into the cities that he had built on the tables. Somehow he did not want to remember it. The very idea of remembering made him feel guilty and wretched. He went and looked out of the window, and as he stood there his wish not to remember the dream made his boots restless, and in their shuffling his right boot kicked against something hard that lay in the folds of the blue brocade curtain. He looked down, stooped, and picked up little Mr. Noah. The nurse must have dropt it there when she cleared away the city. And as he looked upon those wooden features it suddenly became impossible not to think of the dream. He let the remembrance of it come, and it came in a flood. And with it the remembrance of what he had done. He had promised to be Lucy's noble friend, and they had run together to escape from the galloping soldiers. And he had run faster than she. And at the top of the ladder, the ladder of safety,  he had not waited for her . 'Any old hero would have waited for her, and let her go first,' he told himself. 'Any gentleman would, even any  man , let alone a hero. And I just bunked down the ladder and forgot her. I  left  her there.' Remorse stirred his boots more ungently than before. 'But it was only a dream,' he said. And then remorse said, as he had felt all along that it would if he only gave it a chance: 'But suppose it wasn't a dream, suppose it was real. Suppose you  did  leave her there, my noble friend, and that's why she's lost.' Suddenly Philip felt very small, very forlorn, very much alone in the world. But Helen would come back. That telegram would bring her. Yes. And he would have to tell her that perhaps it was his fault. It was in vain that Philip told himself that Helen would never believe about the city. He felt that she would. Why shouldn't she? She knew about the fairy tales and the Arabian Nights. And she would know that these things  did  happen. 'Oh, what shall I do? What shall I do?' he said, quite loud. And there was no one but himself to give the answer. 'If I could only get back into the city,' he said. 'But that hateful nurse has pulled it all down and locked up the nursery. So I can't even build it again. Oh, what  shall  I do?' And with that he began to cry. For now he felt quite sure that the dream wasn't a dream, that he really  had  got into the magic city, had promised to stand by Lucy, and had been false to his promise and to her. He rubbed his eyes with his knuckles and also, rather painfully, with Mr. Noah, whom he still held. 'What shall I do?' he sobbed. And a very very teeny tiny voice said: '~Put me down.~' 'Eh?' said Philip. '~Put me down~,' said the voice again. It was such a teeny tiny voice that he could only just hear it. It was unlikely, of course, that the voice could have been Mr. Noah's; but then whose else could it be? On the bare chance that it  might  have been Mr. Noah who spoke, more unlikely things had happened before, as you know, Philip set the little wooden figure down on the chess-table. It stood there, wooden as ever. 'Put  who  down?' Philip asked. And then, before his eyes, the little wooden figure grew alive, stooped to pick up the yellow disc of wood on which Noah's Ark people stand, rolled it up like a mat, put it under his arm and began to walk towards the side of the table where Philip stood. He knelt down to bring his ears nearer the little live moving thing. ' What  did you say?' he asked, for he fancied that Mr. Noah had again spoken. '~I said, what's the matter?~' said the little voice. 'It's Lucy. She's lost and it's my fault. And I can only just hear you. It hurts my ears hearing you,' complained Philip. '~There's an ear-trumpet in a box on the middle of the cabinet~,' he could just hear the teeny tiny voice say; '~it belonged to a great-aunt. Get it out and listen through it~.' Philip got it out. It was an odd curly thing, and at first he could not be sure which end he ought to put to his ear. But he tried both ends, and on the second trial he heard quite a loud, strong, big voice say: 'That's better.' 'Then it wasn't a dream last night,' said Philip. 'Of course it wasn't,' said Mr. Noah. 'Then where is Lucy?' 'In the city, of course. Where you left her.' 'But she  can't  be,' said Philip desperately. 'The city's all pulled down and gone for ever.' 'The city you built in this room is pulled down,' said Mr. Noah, 'but the city you went to wasn't in this room. Now I put it to you, how could it be?' 'But it  was ,' said Philip, 'or else how could I have got into it.' 'It's a little difficult, I own,' said Mr. Noah. 'But, you see, you built those cities in two worlds. It's pulled down in  this  world. But in the other world it's going on.' 'I don't understand,' said Philip. 'I thought you wouldn't,' said Mr. Noah; 'but it's true, for all that. Everything people make in that world goes on for ever.' 'But how was it that I got in?' 'Because you belong to both worlds. And you built the cities. So they were yours.' 'But Lucy got in.' 'She built up a corner of your city that the nurse had knocked down.' [Illustration: He heard quite a loud, strong, big voice say, 'That's better.'] 'But  you ,' said Philip, more and more bewildered. 'You're here. So you can't be there.' 'But I  am  there,' said Mr. Noah. 'But you're here. And you're alive here. What made you come alive?' 'Your tears,' said Mr. Noah. 'Tears are very strong magic. No, don't begin to cry again. What's the matter?' 'I want to get back into the city.' 'It's dangerous.' 'I don't care.' 'You were glad enough to get away,' said Mr. Noah. 'I know: that's the worst of it,' said Philip. 'Oh, isn't there any way to get back? If I climbed in at the nursery windows and got the bricks and built it all up and, , ' 'Quite unnecessary, I assure you. There are a thousand doors to that city.' 'I wish I could find  one ,' said Philip; 'but, I say, I thought time was all different there. How is it Lucy is lost all this time if time doesn't count?' 'It does count, now,' said Mr. Noah; 'you made it count when you ran away and left Lucy. That set the clocks of the city to the time of this world.' 'I don't understand,' said Philip; 'but it doesn't matter. Show me the door and I'll go back and find Lucy.' 'Build something and go through it,' said Mr. Noah. 'That's all. Your tears are dry on me now. Good-bye.' And he laid down his yellow mat, stepped on to it and was just a little wooden figure again. Philip dropped the ear-trumpet and looked at Mr. Noah. 'I  don't  understand,' he said. But this at least he understood. That Helen would come back when she got that telegram, and that before she came he must go into the other world and find the lost Lucy. 'But oh,' he said, 'suppose I  don't  find her. I wish I hadn't built those cities so big! And time will go on. And, perhaps, when Helen comes back she'll find  me  lost  too , as well as Lucy.' But he dried his eyes and told himself that this was not how heroes behaved. He must build again. Whichever way you looked at it there was no time to be lost. And besides the nurse might occur at any moment. He looked round for building materials. There was the chess-table. It had long narrow legs set round it, rather like arches. Something might be done with it, with books and candlesticks and Japanese vases. Something  was  done. Philip built with earnest care, but also with considerable speed. If the nurse should come in before he had made a door and got through it, come in and find him building again, she was quite capable of putting him to bed, where, of course, building is impossible. In a very little time there was a building. But how to get in. He was, alas, the wrong size. He stood helpless, and once more tears pricked and swelled behind his eyelids. One tear fell on his hand. 'Tears are a strong magic,' Mr. Noah had said. And at the thought the tears stopped. Still there  was  a tear, the one on his hand. He rubbed it on the pillar of the porch. And instantly a queer tight thin feeling swept through him. He felt giddy and shut his eyes. His boots, ever sympathetic, shuffled on the carpet. Or was it the carpet? It was very thick and, ,  He opened his eyes. His feet were once more on the long grass of the illimitable prairie. And in front of him towered the gigantic porch of a vast building and a domino path leading up to it. 'Oh, I am so glad,' cried Philip among the grass. 'I couldn't have borne it if she'd been lost for ever, and all my fault.' The gigantic porch lowered frowningly above him. What would he find on the other side of it? [Illustration: The gigantic porch lowered frowningly above him.] 'I don't care. I've simply got to go,' he said, and stepped out bravely. 'If I can't  be  a hero I'll try to behave like one.' And with that he stepped out, stumbling a little in the thick grass, and the dark shadow of the porch received him.       .       .       .       .       .       .       . 'Bother the child,' said the nurse, coming into the drawing-room a little later; 'if he hasn't been at his precious building game again! I shall have to give him a lesson over this, I can see that. And I will too, a lesson he won't forget in a hurry.' She went through the house, looking for the too bold builder that she might give him that lesson. Then she went through the garden, still on the same errand. Half an hour later she burst into the servants' hall and threw herself into a chair. 'I don't care what happens now,' she said. 'The house is bewitched, I think. I shall go the very minute I've had my dinner.' 'What's up now?' the cook came to the door to say. 'Up?' said the nurse. 'Oh, nothing's  up . What should there be? Everything's all right and beautiful, and just as it should be, of course.' 'Miss Lucy's not found yet, of course, but that's all, isn't it?' 'All? And enough too, I should have thought,' said the nurse. 'But as it happens it's  not  all. The boy's lost now. Oh, I'm not joking. He's lost I tell you, the same as the other one, and I'm off out of this by the two thirty-seven train, and I don't care who knows it.' 'Lor!' said the cook.       .       .       .       .       .       .       . Before starting for the two thirty-seven train the nurse went back to the drawing-room to destroy Philip's new building, to restore to their proper places its books, candlesticks, vases, and chessmen. There we will leave her. CHAPTER IV THE DRAGON-SLAYER When Philip walked up the domino path and under the vast arch into the darkness beyond, his heart felt strong with high resolve. His legs, however, felt weak; strangely weak, especially about the knees. The doorway was so enormous, that which lay beyond was so dark, and he himself so very very small. As he passed under the little gateway which he had built of three dominoes with the little silver knight in armour on the top, he noticed that he was only as high as a domino, and you know how very little that is. Philip went along the domino path. He had to walk carefully, for to him the spots on the dominoes were quite deep hollows. But as they were black they were easy to see. He had made three arches, one beyond another, of two pairs of silver candlesticks with silver inkstands on the top of them. The third pair of silver candlesticks had a book on the top of them because there were no more inkstands. And when he had passed through the three silver arches, he stopped. Beyond lay a sort of velvety darkness with white gleams in it. And as his eyes became accustomed to the darkness, he saw that he was in a great hall of silver pillars, gigantic silver candlesticks they seemed to be, and they went in long vistas this way and that way and every way, like the hop-poles in a hop-field, so that whichever way you turned, a long pillared corridor lay in front of you. Philip had no idea which way he ought to go. It seemed most unlikely that he would find Lucy in a dark hall with silver pillars. 'All the same,' he said, 'it's not so dark as it was, by long chalks.' It was not. The silver pillars had begun to give out a faint soft glow like the silver phosphorescence that lies in sea pools in summer time. 'It's lucky too,' he said, 'because of the holes in the floor.' The holes were the spots on the dominoes with which the pillared hall was paved. 'I wonder what part of the city where Lucy is I shall come out at?' Philip asked himself. But he need not have troubled. He did not come out at all. He walked on and on and on and on and on. He thought he was walking straight, but really he was turning first this way and then that, and then the other way among the avenues of silver pillars which all looked just alike. He was getting very tired, and he had been walking a long time, before he came to anything that was not silver pillars and velvet black under invisible roofs, and floor paved with dominoes laid very close together. 'Oh, I am glad!' he said at last, when he saw the pavement narrow to a single line of dominoes just like the path he had come in by. There was an arch too, like the arch by which he had come in. And then he perceived in a shock of miserable surprise that it was, in fact, the same arch and the same domino path. He had come back, after all that walking, to the point from which he had started. It was most mortifying. So silly! Philip sat down on the edge of the domino path to rest and think. 'Suppose I just walk out and don't believe in magic any more?' he said to himself. 'Helen says magic can only happen to people who believe in magic. So if I just walked out and didn't believe as hard as ever I could, I should be my own right size again, and Lucy would be back, and there wouldn't  be  any magic.' [Illustration: He walked on and on and on.] 'Yes, but,' said that voice that always would come and join in whenever Philip was talking to himself, 'suppose Lucy  does  believe it? Then it'll all go on for her, whatever  you  believe, and she  won't  be back. Besides, you know you've  got  to believe it, because it's true.' 'Oh, bother!' said Philip; 'I'm tired. I don't want to go on.' 'You shouldn't have deserted Lucy,' said the tiresome voice, 'then you wouldn't have had to go back to look for her.' 'But I can't find my way. How can I find my way?' 'You know well enough. Fix your eyes on a far-off pillar and walk straight to it, and when you're nearly there fix your eyes a little farther. You're bound to come out somewhere.' 'But I'm tired and it's so lonely,' said Philip. 'Lucy's lonely too,' said the voice. 'Drop it!' said Philip. And he got up and began to walk again. Also he took the advice of that worrying voice and fixed his eyes on a distant pillar. 'But why should I bother?' he said; 'this is a sort of dream.' 'Even if it  were  a dream,' said the voice, 'there are adventures in it. So you may as well be adventurous.' 'Oh, all right,' said Philip, and on he went. And by walking very carefully and fixing his eyes a long way off, he did at last come right through the hall of silver pillars, and saw beyond the faint glow of the pillars the blue light of day. It shone very brightly through a very little door, and when Philip came to that door he went through it without hesitation. And there he was in a big field. It was rather like the illimitable prairie, only there were great patches of different-coloured flowers. Also there was a path across it, and he followed the path. 'Because,' he said, 'I'm more likely to meet Lucy. Girls always keep to paths. They never explore.' Which just shows how little he knew about girls. He looked back after a while, to see what the hall of pillars looked like from outside, but it was already dim in the mists of distance. But ahead of him he saw a great rough building, rather like Stonehenge. 'I wish I'd come into the other city where the people are, and the soldiers, and the greyhounds, and the cocoa-nuts,' he told himself. 'There's nobody here at all, not even Lucy.' The loneliness of the place grew more and more unpleasing to Philip. But he went on. It seemed more reasonable than to go back. 'I ought to be very hungry,' he said; 'I must have been walking for hours.' But he wasn't hungry. It may have been the magic, or it may have been the odd breakfast he had had. I don't know. He spoke aloud because it was so quiet in that strange open country with no one in it but himself. And no sound but the clump, clump of his boots on the path. And it seemed to him that everything grew quieter and quieter till he could almost hear himself think. Loneliness, real loneliness is a dreadful thing. I hope you will never feel it. Philip looked to right and left, and before him, and on all the wide plain nothing moved. There were the grass and flowers, but no wind stirred them. And there was no sign that any living person had ever trodden that path, except that there  was  a path to tread, and that the path led to the Stonehenge building, and even that seemed to be only a ruin. 'I'll go as far as that anyhow,' said Philip; 'perhaps there'll be a signboard there or something.' There was something. Something most unexpected. Philip reached the building; it was really very like Stonehenge, only the pillars were taller and closer together and there was one high solid towering wall; turned the corner of a massive upright and ran almost into the arms, and quite on to the feet of a man in a white apron and a square paper cap, who sat on a fallen column, eating bread and cheese with a clasp-knife. 'I beg your pardon!' Philip gasped. 'Granted, I'm sure,' said the man; 'but it's a dangerous thing to do, Master Philip, running sheer on to chaps' clasp-knives.' He set Philip on his feet, and waved the knife, which had been so often sharpened that the blade was half worn away. 'Set you down and get your breath,' he said kindly. 'Why, it's  you !' said Philip. 'Course it is. Who should I be if I wasn't me? That's poetry.' 'But how did you get here?' 'Ah!' said the man going on with his bread and cheese, while he talked quite in the friendliest way, 'that's telling.' 'Well, tell then,' said Philip impatiently. But he sat down. 'Well, you say it's me. Who be it? Give it a name.' 'You're old Perrin,' said Pip; 'I mean, of course, I beg your pardon, you're Mr. Perrin, the carpenter.' 'And what does carpenters do?' 'Carp, I suppose,' said Philip. 'That means they make things, doesn't it?' 'That's it,' said the man encouragingly; 'what sort of things now might old Perrin have made for you?' 'You made my wheelbarrow, I know,' said Philip, 'and my bricks.' 'Ah!' said Mr. Perrin, 'now you've got it. I made your bricks, seasoned oak, and true to the thousandth of an inch, they was. And that's how I got here. So now you know.' 'But what are you doing here?' said Philip, wriggling restlessly on the fallen column. 'Waiting for you. Them as knows sent me out to meet you, and give you a hint of what's expected of you.' 'Well. What  is ?' said Philip. 'I mean I think it's very kind of you. What  is  expected?' 'Plenty of time,' said the carpenter, 'plenty. Nothing ain't expected of you till towards sundown.' 'I do think it was most awfully kind of you,' said Philip, who had now thought this over. 'You was kind to old Perrin once,' said that person. 'Was I?' said Philip, much surprised. 'Yes; when my little girl was ailing you brought her a lot of pears off your own tree. Not one of 'em you didn't 'ave yourself that year, Miss Helen told me. And you brought back our kitten, the sandy and white one with black spots, when it strayed. So I was quite willing to come and meet you when so told. And knowing something of young gentlemen's peckers, owing to being in business once next door to a boys' school, I made so bold as to bring you a snack.' He reached a hand down behind the fallen pillar on which they sat and brought up a basket. 'Here,' he said. And Philip, raising the lid, was delighted to find that he was hungry. It was a pleasant basketful. Meat pasties, red hairy gooseberries, a stone bottle of ginger-beer, a blue mug with Philip on it in gold letters, a slice of soda cake and two farthing sugar-sticks. 'I'm sure I've seen that basket before,' said the boy as he ate. 'Like enough. It's the one you brought them pears down in.' 'Now look here,' said Philip, through his seventh bite of pasty, 'you  must  tell me how you got here. And tell me where you've got to. You've simply no idea how muddling it all is to me. Do tell me  everything . Where are we, I mean, and why? And what I've got to do. And why? And when? Tell me every single thing.' And he took the eighth bite. 'You really don't know, sir?' 'No,' said Philip, contemplating the ninth or last bite but one. It was a large pasty. 'Well then. Here goes. But I was always a poor speaker, and so considered even by friends at cricket dinners and what not.' 'But I don't want you to speak,' said Philip; 'just tell me.' 'Well, then. How did I get here? I got here through having made them bricks what you built this tumble-down old ancient place with.' ' I  built?' 'Yes, with them bricks I made you. I understand as this was the first building you ever put up. That's why it's first on the road to where you want to get to!' Philip looked round at the Stonehenge building and saw that it was indeed built of enormous oak bricks. 'Of course,' he said, 'only I've grown smaller.' 'Or they've grown bigger,' said Mr. Perrin; 'it's the same thing. You see it's like this. All the cities and things you ever built is in this country. I don't know how it's managed, no more'n what you do. But so it is. And as you made 'em, you've the right to come to them, if you can get there. And you have got there. It isn't every one has the luck, I'm told. Well, then, you made the cities, but you made 'em out of what other folks had made, things like bricks and chessmen and books and candlesticks and dominoes and brass basins and every sort of kind of thing. An' all the people who helped to make all them things you used to build with, they're all here too. D'you see?  Making's  the thing. If it was no more than the lad that turned the handle of the grindstone to sharp the knife that carved a bit of a cabinet or what not, or a child that picked a teazle to finish a bit of the cloth that's glued on to the bottom of a chessman, they're all here. They're what's called the population of your cities.' 'I see. They've got small, like I have,' said Philip. 'Or the cities has got big,' said the carpenter; 'it comes to the same thing. I wish you wouldn't interrupt, Master Philip. You put me out.' 'I won't again,' said Philip. 'Only do tell me just one thing. How can you be here and at Amblehurst too?' 'We come here,' said the carpenter slowly, 'when we're asleep.' 'Oh!' said Philip, deeply disappointed; 'it's just a dream then?' 'Not it. We come here when we're too sound asleep to dream. You go through the dreams and come out on the other side where everything's real. That's  here .' 'Go on,' said Philip. 'I dunno where I was. You do put me out so.' 'Pop you something or other,' said Philip. 'Population. Yes. Well, all those people as made the things you made the cities of, they live in the cities and they've made the insides to the houses.' 'What do they do?' 'Oh, they just live here. And they buy and sell and plant gardens and work and play like everybody does in other cities. And when they go to sleep they go slap through their dreams and into the other world, and work and play there, see? That's how it goes on. There's a lot more, but that's enough for one time. You get on with your gooseberries.' 'But they aren't all real people, are they? There's Mr. Noah?' 'Ah, those is aristocracy, the ones you put in when you built the cities. They're our old families. Very much respected. They're all very high up in the world. Came over with the Conker, as the saying is. There's the Noah family. They're the oldest of all, of course. And the dolls you've put in different times and the tin soldiers, and of course all the Noah's ark animals is alive except when you used them for building, and then they're statues.' 'But I don't see,' said Philip, 'I really don't see how all these cities that I built at different times can still be here, all together and all going on at once, when I know they've all been pulled down.' 'Well, I'm no scholard. But I did hear Mr. Noah say once in a lecture,  he's  a speaker, if you like, I heard him say it was like when you take a person's photo. The person is so many inches thick through and so many feet high and he's round and he's solid. But in the photo he's  flat . Because everything's flat in photos. But all the same it's him right enough. You get him into the photo. Then all you've got to do is to get 'im out again into where everything's thick and tall and round and solid. And it's quite easy, I believe, once you know the trick.' 'Stop,' said Philip suddenly. 'I think my head's going to burst.' 'Ah!' said the carpenter kindly. 'I felt like that at first. Lie down and try to sleep it off a bit. Eddication does go to your head something crool. I've often noticed it.' And indeed Philip was quite glad to lie down among the long grass and be covered up with the carpenter's coat. He fell asleep at once. An hour later he woke again, looked at the wrinkled-apple face of Mr. Perrin and began to remember. 'I'm glad  you're  here anyhow,' he said to the carpenter; 'it was horribly lonely. You don't know.' 'That's why I was sent to meet you,' said Mr. Perrin simply. 'But how did you know?' 'Mr. Noah sent for me early this morning. Bless you, he knows all about everything. Says he, 'You go and meet 'im and tell 'im all you can. If he wants to be a Deliverer, let 'im,' says Mr. Noah.' 'But how do you begin being a Deliverer?' Philip asked, sitting up and feeling suddenly very grand and manly, and very glad that Lucy was not there to interfere. 'There's lots of different ways,' said Mr. Perrin. 'Your particular way's simple. You just got to kill the dragon.' 'A  live  dragon?' 'Live!' said Mr. Perrin. 'Why he's all over the place and as green as grass he is. Lively as a kitten. He's got a broken spear sticking out of his side, so some one must have had a try at baggin' him, some time or another.' 'Don't you think,' said Philip, a little overcome by this vivid picture, 'that perhaps I'd better look for Lucy first, and be a Deliverer afterwards?' 'If you're  afraid ,' said Mr. Perrin. 'I'm not,' said Philip doubtfully. 'You see,' said the carpenter, 'what you've got to consider is: are you going to be the hero of this 'ere adventure or ain't you? You can't 'ave it both ways. An' if you are, you may's well make up your mind, cause killing a dragon ain't the end of it, not by no means.' 'Do you mean there are more dragons?' 'Not dragons,' said the carpenter soothingly; 'not dragons exactly. But there. I don't want to lower your heart. If you kills the dragon, then afterwards there's six more hard things you've got to do. And then they make you king. Take it or leave it. Only, if you take it we'd best be starting. And anyhow we may as well get a move on us, because at sundown the dragon comes out to drink and exercise of himself. You can hear him rattling all night among these 'ere ruins; miles off you can 'ear 'im of a still night.' 'Suppose I don't want to be a Deliverer,' said Philip slowly. 'Then you'll be a Destroyer,' said the carpenter; 'there's only these two situations vacant here at present. Come, Master Philip, sir, don't talk as if you wasn't going to be a man and do your duty for England, Home and Beauty, like it says in the song. Let's be starting, shall us?' 'You think I ought to be the Deliverer?' 'Ought stands for nothing,' said Mr. Perrin. 'I think you're a going to  be  the Deliverer; that's what I think. Come on!' As they rose to go, Philip had a brief fleeting vision of a very smart lady in a motor veil, disappearing round the corner of a pillar. 'Are there many motors about here?' he asked, not wishing to talk any more about dragons just then. 'Not a single one,' said Mr. Perrin unexpectedly. 'Nor yet phonographs, nor railways, nor factory chimneys, nor none of them loud ugly things. Nor yet advertisements, nor newspapers, nor barbed wire.' After that the two walked silently away from the ruin. Philip was trying to feel as brave and confident as a Deliverer should. He reminded himself of St. George. And he remembered that the hero  never  fails to kill the dragon. But he still felt a little uneasy. It takes some time to accustom yourself to being a hero. But he could not help looking over his shoulder every now and then to see if the dragon was coming. So far it wasn't. 'Well,' said Mr. Perrin as they drew near a square tower with a long flight of steps leading up to it, 'what do you say?' 'I wasn't saying anything,' said Philip. 'I mean are you going to be the Deliverer?' Then something in Philip's heart seemed to swell, and a choking feeling came into his throat, and he felt more frightened than he had ever felt before, as he said, looking as brave as he could: 'Yes. I am.' Perrin clapped his hands. And instantly from the doors of the tower and from behind it came dozens of people, and down the long steps, alone, came Mr. Noah, moving with careful dignity and carrying his yellow mat neatly rolled under his arm. All the people clapped their hands, till Mr. Noah, standing on the third step, raised his hands to command silence. 'Friends,' he said, 'and fellow-citizens of Polistopolis, you see before you one who says that he is the Deliverer. He was yesterday arrested and tried as a trespasser, and condemned to imprisonment. He escaped and you all assumed that he was the Destroyer in disguise. But now he has returned and of his own free will he chooses to attempt the accomplishment of the seven great deeds. And the first of these is the killing of the great green dragon.' The people, who were a mixed crowd of all nations, cheered loudly. 'So now,' said Mr. Noah, 'we will make him our knight.' 'Kneel,' said Mr. Noah, 'in token of fealty to the Kingdom of Cities.' Philip knelt. 'You shall now speak after me,' said Mr. Noah solemnly. 'Say what I say,' he whispered, and Philip said it. This was it. 'I, Philip, claim to be the Deliverer of this great nation, and I pledge myself to carry out the seven great deeds that shall prove my claim to the Deliverership and the throne. I pledge my honour to be the champion of this city, and the enemy of its Destroyer.' When Philip had said this, Mr. Noah drew forth a bright silver-hilted sword and held it over him. 'You must be knighted,' he said; 'those among my audience who have read any history will be aware that no mere commoner can expect to conquer a dragon. We must give our would-be Deliverer every chance. So I will make him a knight.' He tapped Philip lightly on the shoulder and said, 'Rise up, Sir Philip!' This was really grand, and Philip felt new courage as Mr. Noah handed him the silver sword, and all the people cheered. But as the cheers died down, a thin and disagreeable voice suddenly said: 'But  I  claim to be the Deliverer too.' It was like a thunderbolt. Every one stopped cheering and stood with mouth open and head turned towards the person who had spoken. And the person who had spoken was the smartly dressed lady in the motor veil, whom Philip had seen among the ruins. 'A trespasser! a trespasser!' cried the crowd; 'to prison with it!' and angry, threatening voices began to arise. 'I'm no more a trespasser than he is,' said the voice, 'and if I say I am the Deliverer, you can't stop me. I can kill dragons or do anything  he  can do.' 'Silence, trespasser,' said Mr. Noah, with cold dignity. 'You should have spoken earlier. At present Sir Philip occupies the position of candidate to the post of King-Deliverer. There is no other position open to you except that of Destroyer.' [Illustration: 'Silence, trespasser,' said Mr. Noah, with cold dignity.] 'But suppose the boy doesn't do it?' said the voice behind the veil. 'True,' said Mr. Noah. 'You may if you choose, occupy for the present the position of Pretender-in-Chief to the Claimancy of the Deliverership, an office now and here created expressly for you. The position of Claimant to the Destroyership is also,' he added reflectively, 'open to you.' 'Then if he doesn't do it,' said the veiled lady, 'I can be the Deliverer.' 'You can try,' said Mr. Noah. 'There are a special set of tasks to be performed if the claimant to the Deliverership be a woman.' 'What are they?' said the veiled lady. 'If Sir Philip fails you will be duly instructed in the deeds required of a Deliverer who is a woman. And now, my friends, let us retire and leave Sir Philip to deal with the dragon. We shall watch anxiously from yonder ramparts,' he added encouragingly. 'But isn't any one to help me?' said Philip, deeply uneasy. 'It is not usual,' said Mr. Noah, 'for champions to require assistance with dragons.' 'I should think not indeed,' said the veiled lady; 'but you're not going the usual way about it at all. Where's the princess, I should like to know?' 'There isn't any princess,' said Mr. Noah. 'Then it won't be a proper dragon-killing,' she said, with an angry shaking of skirts; 'that's all I can say.' 'I wish it  was  all,' said Mr. Noah to himself. 'If there isn't a princess it isn't fair,' said the veiled one; 'and I shall consider it's my turn to be Deliverer.' 'Be silent, woman,' said Mr. Noah. 'Woman, indeed,' said the lady. 'I ought to have a proper title.' 'Your title is the Pretender to the, , ' 'I know,' she interrupted; 'but you forget you're speaking to a lady. You can call me the Pretenderette.' Mr. Noah turned coldly from her and pressed two Roman candles and a box of matches into Philip's hand. 'When you have arranged your plans and are quite sure that you will be able to kill the dragon, light one of these. We will then have a princess in readiness, and on observing your signal will tie her to a tree, or, since this is a district where trees are rare and buildings frequent, to a pillar. She will be perfectly safe if you make your plans correctly. And in any case you must not attempt to deal with the dragon without first lighting the Roman candle.' 'And the dragon will see it and go away.' 'Exactly,' said Mr. Noah. 'Or perhaps he will see it and not go away. Time alone will show. The task that is without difficulties can never really appeal to a hero. You will find weapons, cords, nets, shields and various first aids to the young dragon-catcher in the vaults below this tower. Good evening, Sir Philip,' he ended warmly. 'We wish you every success.' And with that the whole crowd began to go away. ' I  know who you ought to have for princess,' the Pretenderette said as they went. And Mr. Noah said: 'Silence in court.' 'This isn't a court,' said the Pretenderette aggravatingly. 'Wherever justice is, is a court,' said Mr. Noah, 'and I accuse you of contempt of it. Guards, arrest this person and take her to prison at once.' There was a scuffling and a shrieking and then the voices withdrew gradually, the angry voice of even the Pretenderette growing fainter and fainter till it died away altogether. Philip was left alone. His first act was to go up to the top of the tower and look out to see if he could see the dragon. He looked east and north and south and west, and he saw the ramparts of the fort where Mr. Noah and the others were now safely bestowed. He saw also other towers and cities in the distance, and he saw the ruins where he had met Mr. Perrin. And among those ruins something was moving. Something long and jointed and green. It could be nothing but the dragon. 'Oh, Crikey!' said Philip to himself; 'whatever shall I do? Perhaps I'd better see what weapons there are.' So he ran down the stairs and down and down till he came to the vaults of the castle, and there he found everything a dragon-killer could possibly need, even to a little red book called the  Young Dragon-Catcher's Vade Mecum, or a Complete Guide to the Good Sport of Dragon-Slaying ; and a pair of excellent field-glasses. The top of the tower seemed the safest place. It was there that he tried to read the book. The words were very long and most difficultly spelt. But he did manage to make out that all dragons sleep for one hour after sunset. Then he heard a loud rattling sound from the ruin, and he knew it was the dragon who was making that sound, so he looked through the field-glasses, frowning with anxiety to see what the dragon was doing. And as he looked he started and almost dropped the glasses, and the frown cleared away from his forehead and he gave a sigh that was almost a sob and almost a laugh, and then he said 'That old thing!' Then he looked again, and this is what he saw. An enormous green dragon, very long and fierce-looking, that rattled as it moved, going in and out among the ruins, rubbing itself against the fallen pillars. And the reason Philip laughed and sighed was that he knew that dragon very well indeed. He had known it long ago. It was the clockwork lizard that had been given him the Christmas before last. And he remembered that he had put it into one of the cities he and Helen had built together. Only now, of course, it had grown big and had come alive like all the other images of live things he had put in his cities. But he saw that it was still a clockwork creature. And its key was sticking out of its side. And it was rubbing itself against the pillars so as to turn the key and wind itself up. But this was a slow business and the winding was not half done when the sun set. The dragon instantly lay down and went to sleep. 'Well,' said Philip, 'now I've got to think.' He did think, harder than he had ever done before. And when he had finished thinking he went down into the vault and got a long rope. Then he stood still a moment, wondering if he really were brave enough. And then he remembered 'Rise up, Sir Philip,' and he knew that a knight simply  mustn't  be afraid. So he went out in the dusk towards the dragon. He knew it would sleep for an hour. But all the same, ,  And the twilight was growing deeper and deeper. Still there was plenty of light to find the ruin, and also to find the dragon. There it lay, about ten or twelve yards of solid dark dragon-flesh. Its metal claws gleamed in the last of the daylight. Its great mouth was open, and its breathing, as it slept, was like the sound of the sea on a rough night. 'Rise up, Sir Philip,' he said to himself, and walked along close to the dragon till he came to the middle part where the key was sticking out, which Mr. Perrin had thought was a piece of an old spear with which some one had once tried to kill the monster. Philip fastened one end of his rope very securely to the key, how thankful he was that Helen had taught him to tie knots that were not granny-knots. The dragon lay quite still, and went on breathing like a stormy sea. Then the dragon-slayer fastened the other end of the rope to the main wall of the ruin which was very strong and firm, and then he went back to his tower as fast as he could and struck a match and lighted his Roman candle. You see the idea? It was really rather a clever one. When the dragon woke it would find that it was held prisoner by the ropes. It would be furious and try to get free. And in its struggles it would be certain to get free, but this it could only do by detaching itself from its key. When once the key was out the dragon would be unable to wind itself up any more, and would be as good as dead. Of course Sir Philip could cut off its head with the silver-hilted sword if Mr. Noah really wished it. It was, as you see, an excellent plan, as far as it went. Philip sat on the top of his tower quite free from anxiety, and ate a few hairy red gooseberries that happened to be loose in his pocket. Within three minutes of his lighting his Roman candle a shower of golden rain went up in the south, some immense Catherine-wheels appeared in the east, and in the north a long line of rockets presented almost the appearance of an aurora borealis. Red fire, green fire, then rockets again. The whole of the plain was lit by more fireworks than Philip had ever seen, even at the Crystal Palace. By their light he saw a procession come out of the fort, cross to a pillar that stood solitary on the plain, and tie to it a white figure. 'The Princess, I suppose,' said Philip; 'well,  she's  all right anyway.' Then the procession went back to the fort, and then the dragon awoke. Philip could see the great creature stretching itself and shaking its vast head as a dog does when it comes out of the water. 'I expect it doesn't like the fireworks,' said Philip. And he was quite right. And now the dragon saw the Princess who had been placed at a convenient spot about half-way between the ruins and Philip's tower. It threw up its snout and uttered a devastating howl, and Philip felt with a thrill of horror that, clockwork or no clockwork, the brute was alive, and desperately dangerous. And now it had perceived that it was bound. With great heavings and throes, with snortings and bellowings, with scratchings and tearings of its great claws and lashings of its terrible tail, it writhed and fought to be free, and the light of thousands of fireworks illuminated the gigantic struggle. Then what Philip had known would happen, did happen. The great wall held fast, the rope held fast, the dragon held fast. It was the key that gave way. With an echoing grinding rusty sound like a goods train shunting on a siding, the key was drawn from the keyhole in the dragon's side and left still fast to its rope like an anchor to a cable.  Left.  For now that happened which Philip had not foreseen. He had forgotten that before it fell asleep the dragon had partly wound itself up. And its struggles had not used up all the winding. There was go in the dragon yet. And with a yell of fury it set off across the plain, wriggling its green rattling length towards, the Princess. And now there was no time to think whether one was afraid or not. Philip went down those tower stairs more quickly than he had ever gone down stairs in his life, and he was not bad at stairs even at ordinary times. He put his sword over his shoulder as you do a gun, and ran. Like the dragon he made straight for the Princess. And now it was a race between him and the dragon. Philip ran and ran. His heart thumped, his feet had that leaden feeling that comes in nightmares. He felt as if he were dying. Keep on, keep on, faster, faster, you mustn't stop. Ah! that's better. He has got his second wind. He is going faster. And the dragon, or is it fancy? is going not quite so fast. How he did it Philip never knew. But with a last spurt he reached the pillar where the Princess stood bound. And the dragon was twenty yards away, coming on and on and on. Philip stood quite still, recovering his breath. And more and more slowly, but with no sign of stopping, the dragon came on. Behind him, where the pillar was, Philip heard some one crying softly. Then the dragon was quite near. Philip took three steps forward, took aim with his sword, shut his eyes and hit as hard as he could. Then something hard and heavy knocked him over, and for a time he knew no more.       .       .       .       .       .       .       . When he came to himself again, Mr. Noah was giving him something nasty to drink out of a medicine glass, Mr. Perrin was patting him on the back, all the people were shouting like mad, and more fireworks than ever were being let off. Beside him lay the dragon, lifeless and still. [Illustration: Then something hard and heavy knocked him over.] 'Oh!' said Philip, 'did I really do it?' 'You did indeed,' said Mr. Noah; 'however you may succeed with the other deeds, you are the hero of this one. And now, if you feel well enough, prepare to receive the reward of Valour and Chivalry.' 'Oh!' said Philip, brightening, 'I didn't know there was to be a reward.' 'Only the usual one,' said Mr Noah. 'The Princess, you know.' Philip became aware that a figure in a white veil was standing quite near him; round its feet lay lengths of cut rope. 'The Princess is yours,' said Mr. Noah, with generous affability. 'But I don't want her,' said Philip, adding by an afterthought, 'thank you.' 'You should have thought of that before,' said Mr. Noah. 'You can't go doing deeds of valour, you know, and then shirking the reward. Take her. She is yours.' 'Any one who likes may have her,' said Philip desperately. 'If she's mine, I can give her away, can't I? You must see yourself I can't be bothered with princesses if I've got all those other deeds to do.' 'That's not my affair,' said Mr. Noah. 'Perhaps you might arrange to board her out while you're doing your deeds. But at present she is waiting for you to take her by the hand and raise her veil.' 'Must I?' said Philip miserably. 'Well, here goes.' He took a small cold hand in one of his and with the other lifted, very gingerly, a corner of the veil. The other hand of the Princess drew back the veil, and the Dragon-Slayer and the Princess were face to face. 'Why!' cried Philip, between relief and disgust, 'it's only Lucy!' CHAPTER V ON THE CARPET The Princess was just Lucy. 'It's too bad,' said Philip. 'I do think.' Then he stopped short and just looked cross. 'The Princess and the Champion will now have their teas,' said Mr. Noah. 'Right about face, everybody, please, and quick march.' Philip and Lucy found themselves marching side by side through the night made yellow with continuous fireworks. You must picture them marching across a great plain of grass where many coloured flowers grew. You see a good many of Philip's buildings had been made on the drawing-room carpet at home, which was green with pink and blue and yellow and white flowers. And this carpet had turned into grass and growing flowers, following that strange law which caused things to change into other things, like themselves, but larger and really belonging to a living world. No one spoke. Philip said nothing because he was in a bad temper. And if you are in a bad temper, nothing is a good thing to say. To circumvent a dragon and then kill it, and to have such an adventure end in tea with Lucy, was too much. And he had other reasons for silence too. And Lucy was silent because she had so much to say that she didn't know where to begin; and besides, she could feel how cross Philip was. The crowd did not talk because it was not etiquette to talk when taking part in processions. Mr. Noah did not talk because it made him out of breath to walk and talk at the same time, two things neither of which he had been designed to do. So that it was quite a silent party which at last passed through the gateway of the town and up its streets. Philip wondered where the tea would be, not in the prison of course. It was very late for tea, too, quite the middle of the night it seemed. But all the streets were brilliantly lighted, and flags and festoons of flowers hung from all the windows and across all the streets. It was in the front of a big building in one of the great squares of the city that an extra display of coloured lamps disclosed open doors and red-carpeted steps. Mr. Noah hurried up them, and turned to receive Philip and Lucy. 'The City of Polistopolis,' he said, 'whose unworthy representative I am, greets in my person the most noble Sir Philip, Knight and Slayer of the Dragon. Also the Princess whom he has rescued. Be pleased to enter.' They went up the red-cloth covered steps and into a hall, very splendid with silver and ivory. Mr. Noah stooped to a confidential question. 'You'd like a wash, perhaps?' he said, 'and your Princess too. And perhaps you'd like to dress up a little? Before the banquet, you know.' 'Banquet?' said Philip. 'I thought it was tea.' 'Business before pleasure,' said Mr. Noah; 'first the banquet, then the tea. This way to the dressing-rooms.' There were two doors side by side. On one door was painted 'Knight's dressing-room,' on the other 'Princess's dressing-room.' 'Look out,' said Mr. Noah; 'the paint is wet. You see there wasn't much time.' Philip found his dressing-room very interesting. The walls were entirely of looking-glass, and on tables in the middle of the room lay all sorts of clothes of beautiful colours and odd shapes. Shoes, stockings, hats, crowns, armour, swords, cloaks, breeches, waistcoats, jerkins, trunk hose. An open door showed a marble bath-room. The bath was sunk in the floor as the baths of luxurious Roman Empresses used to be, and as nowadays baths sometimes are, in model dwellings. (Only I am told that some people keep their coals in the baths, which is quite useless because coals are always black however much you wash them.) Philip undressed and went into the warm clear water, greenish between the air and the marble. Why is it so pleasant to have a bath, and so tiresome to wash your hands and face in a basin? He put on his shirt and knickerbockers again, and wandered round the room looking at the clothes laid out there, and wondering which of the wonderful costumes would be really suitable for a knight to wear at a banquet. After considerable hesitation he decided on a little soft shirt of chain-mail that made just a double handful of tiny steel links as he held it. But a difficulty arose. 'I don't know how to put it on,' said Philip; 'and I expect the banquet is waiting. How cross it'll be.' He stood undecided, holding the chain mail in his hands, when his eyes fell on a bell handle. Above it was an ivory plate, and on it in black letters the word Valet. Philip rang the bell. Instantly a soft tap at the door heralded the entrance of a person whom Philip at the first glance supposed to be a sandwich man. But the second glance showed that the oblong flat things which he wore were not sandwich-boards, but dominoes. The person between them bowed low. 'Oh!' said Philip, 'I rang for the valet.' 'I am not the valet,' said the domino-enclosed person, who seemed to be in skintight black clothes under his dominoes, 'I am the Master of the Robes. I only attend on really distinguished persons. Double-six, at your service, Sir. Have you chosen your dress?' 'I'd like to wear the armour,' said Philip, holding it out. 'It seems the right thing for a Knight,' he added. 'Quite so, sir. I confirm your opinion.' He proceeded to dress Philip in a white tunic and to fasten the coat of mail over this. 'I've had a great deal of experience,' he said; 'you couldn't have chosen better. You see, I'm master of the subject of dress. I am able to give my whole mind to it; my own dress being fixed by law and not subject to changes of fashion leaves me free to think for others. And I think deeply. But I see that you can think for yourself.' You have no idea how jolly Philip looked in the mail coat and mailed hood, just like a Crusader. At the doorway of the dressing-room he met Lucy in a short white dress and a coronal of pearls round her head. 'I always wanted to be a fairy,' she said. 'Did you have any one to dress you?' he asked. 'Oh no!' said Lucy calmly. 'I always dress myself.' 'Ladies have the advantage there,' said Double-six, bowing and walking backwards. 'The banquet is spread.' It turned out to be spread on three tables, one along each side of a great room, and one across the top of the room, on a dais, such a table as that high one at which dons and distinguished strangers sit in the Halls of colleges. Mr. Noah was already in his place in the middle of the high table, and Lucy and Philip now took their places at each side of him. The table was spread with all sorts of nice-looking foods and plates of a pink-and-white pattern very familiar to Philip. They were, in fact, as he soon realised, the painted wooden plates from his sister's old dolls' house. There was no food just in front of the children, only a great empty bowl of silver. Philip fingered his knife and fork; the pattern of those also was familiar to him. They were indeed the little leaden ones out of the dolls' house knife-basket of green and silver filagree. He hungrily waited. Servants in straight yellow dresses and red masks and caps were beginning to handle the dishes. A dish was handed to him. A beautiful jelly it looked like. He took up his spoon and was just about to help himself, when Mr. Noah whispered ardently, 'Don't!' and as Philip looked at him in astonishment he added, still in a whisper, 'Pretend, can't you? Have you never had a pretending banquet?' But before he had caught the whisper, Philip had tried to press the edge of the leaden spoon into the shape of jelly. And he felt that the jelly was quite hard. He went through the form of helping himself, but it was just nothing that he put on his plate. And he saw that Mr. Noah and Lucy and all the other guests did the same. Presently another dish was handed to him. There was no changing of plates. 'They  needn't ,' Philip thought bitterly. This time it was a fat goose, not carved, and now Philip saw that it was attached to its dish with glue. Then he understood. (You know the beautiful but uneatable feasts which are given you in a white cardboard box with blue binding and fine shavings to pack the dishes and keep them from breaking? I myself, when I was little, had such a banquet in a box. There were twelve dishes: a ham, brown and shapely; a pair of roast chickens, also brown and more anatomical than the ham; a glazed tongue, real tongue-shape, none of your tinned round mysteries; a dish of sausages; two handsome fish, a little blue, perhaps; a joint of beef, ribs I think, very red as to the lean and very white in the fat parts; a pork pie, delicately bronzed like a traveller in Central Africa. For sweets I had shapes, shapes of beauty, a jelly and a cream; a Swiss roll too, and a plum pudding; asparagus there was also and a cauliflower, and a dish of the greenest peas in all this grey world. This was my banquet outfit. I remember that the woodenness of it all depressed us wonderfully; the oneness of dish and food baffled all make-believe. With the point of nurse's scissors we prised the viands from the platters. But their wooden nature was unconquerable. One could not pretend to eat a whole chicken any better when it was detached from its dish, and the sausages were one solid block. And when you licked the jelly it only tasted of glue and paint. And when we tried to re-roast the chickens at the nursery grate, they caught fire, and then they smelt of gasworks and india-rubber. But I am wandering. When you remember the things that happened when you were a child, you could go on writing about them for ever. I will put all this in brackets, and then you need not read it if you don't want to.) [Illustration: Mr. Noah whispered ardently, 'Don't!'] But those painted wooden foods adhering firmly to their dishes were the kind of food of which the banquet now offered to Philip and Lucy was composed. Only they had more dishes than I had. They had as well a turkey, eight raspberry jam tarts, a pine-apple, a melon, a dish of oysters in the shell, a piece of boiled bacon and a leg of mutton. But all were equally wooden and uneatable. Philip and Lucy, growing hungrier and hungrier, pretended with sinking hearts to eat and enjoy the wooden feast. Wine was served in those little goblets which they knew so well, where the double glasses restrained and contained a red fluid which  looked  like wine. They did not want wine, but they were thirsty as well as hungry. Philip wondered what the waiters were. He had plenty of time to wonder while the long banquet went on. It was not till he saw a group of them standing stiffly together at the end of the hall that he knew they must be the matches with which he had once peopled a city, no other inhabitants being at hand. When all the dishes had been handed, speeches happened. 'Friends and fellow-citizens,' Mr. Noah began, and went on to say how brave and clever Sir Philip was, and how likely it was that he would turn out to be the Deliverer. Philip did not hear all this speech. He was thinking of things to eat. Then every one in the hall stood and shouted, and Philip found that he was expected to take his turn at speech-making. He stood up trembling and wretched. 'Friends and fellow-citizens,' he said, 'thank you very much. I want to be the Deliverer, but I don't know if I can,' and sat down again amid roars of applause. Then there was music, from a grated gallery. And then, I cannot begin to tell you how glad Lucy and Philip were, Mr. Noah said, once more in a whisper, 'Cheer up! the banquet is over.  Now  we'll have tea.' 'Tea' turned out to be bread and milk in a very cosy, blue-silk-lined room opening out of the banqueting-hall. Only Lucy, Philip and Mr. Noah were present. Bread and milk is very good even when you have to eat it with the leaden spoons out of the dolls'-house basket. When it was much later Mr. Noah suddenly said 'good-night,' and in a maze of sleepy repletion (look that up in the dicker, will you?) the children went to bed. Philip's bed was of gold with yellow satin curtains, and Lucy's was made of silver, with curtains of silk that were white. But the metals and colours made no difference to their deep and dreamless sleep. And in the morning there was bread and milk again, and the two of them had it in the blue room without Mr. Noah. 'Well,' said Lucy, looking up from the bowl of white floating cubes, 'do you think you're getting to like me any better?' ' No ,' said Philip, brief and stern like the skipper in the song. 'I wish you would,' said Lucy. 'Well, I can't,' said Philip; 'but I do want to say one thing. I'm sorry I bunked and left you. And I did come back.' 'I know you did,' said Lucy. 'I came back to fetch you,' said Philip, 'and now we'd better get along home.' 'You've got to do seven deeds of power before you can get home,' said Lucy. 'Oh! I remember, Perrin told me,' said he. 'Well,' Lucy went on, 'that'll take ages. No one can go out of this place  twice  unless he's a King-Deliverer. You've gone out  once , without  me . Before you can go again you've got to do seven noble deeds.' 'I killed the dragon,' said Philip, modestly proud. 'That's only one,' she said; 'there are six more.' And she ate bread and milk with firmness. 'Do you like this adventure?' he asked abruptly. 'It's more interesting than anything that ever happened to me,' she said. 'If you were nice I should like it awfully. But as it is, , ' 'I'm sorry you don't think I'm nice,' said he. 'Well, what do  you  think?' she said. Philip reflected. He did not want not to be nice. None of us do. Though you might not think it to see how some of us behave. True politeness, he remembered having been told, consists in showing an interest in other people's affairs. 'Tell me,' he said, very much wishing to be polite and nice. 'Tell me what happened after I, after I, after you didn't come down the ladder with me.' 'Alone and deserted,' Lucy answered promptly, 'my sworn friend having hooked it and left me, I fell down, and both my hands were full of gravel, and the fierce soldiery surrounded me.' 'I thought you were coming just behind me,' said Philip, frowning. 'Well, I wasn't.' 'And then.' 'Well, then, ,  You  were  silly not to stay. They surrounded me, the soldiers, I mean, and the captain said, 'Tell me the truth. Are you a Destroyer or a Deliverer?' So, of course, I said I wasn't a destroyer, whatever I was; and then they took me to the palace and said I could be a Princess till the Deliverer King turned up. They said,' she giggled gaily, 'that my hair was the hair of a Deliverer and not of a Destroyer, and I've been most awfully happy ever since. Have you?' 'No,' said Philip, remembering the miserable feeling of having been a coward and a sneak that had come upon him when he found that he had saved his own skin and left Lucy alone in an unknown and dangerous world; 'not exactly happy, I shouldn't call it.' 'It's beautiful being a Princess,' said Lucy. 'I wonder what your next noble deed will be. I wonder whether I could help you with it?' She looked wistfully at him. 'If I'm going to do noble deeds I'll do them. I don't want any help, thank you, especially from girls,' he answered. 'I wish you did,' said Lucy, and finished her bread and milk. Philip's bowl also was empty. He stretched arms and legs and neck. 'It is rum,' he said; 'before this began I never thought a thing like this  could  begin, did you?' 'I don't know,' she said, 'everything's very wonderful. I've always been expecting things to be more wonderful than they ever have been. You get sort of hints and nudges, you know. Fairy tales, yes, and dreams, you can't help feeling they must mean  something . And your sister and my daddy; the two of them being such friends when they were little, and then parted and then getting friends again;,  that's  like a story in a dream, isn't it? And your building the city and me helping. And my daddy being such a dear darling and your sister being such a darling dear. It did make me think beautiful things were sort of likely. Didn't it you?' 'No,' said Philip; 'I mean yes,' he said, and he was in that moment nearer to liking Lucy than he had ever been before; 'everything's very wonderful, isn't it?' 'Ahem!' said a respectful cough behind them. They turned to meet the calm gaze of Double-six. 'If you've quite finished breakfast, Sir Philip,' he said, 'Mr. Noah would be pleased to see you in his office.' 'Me too?' said Lucy, before Philip could say, 'Only me, I suppose?' 'You may come too, if you wish it, your Highness,' said Double-six, bowing stiffly. They found Mr. Noah very busy in a little room littered with papers; he was sitting at a table writing. 'Good-morning, Princess,' he said, 'good-morning, Sir Philip. You see me very busy. I am trying to arrange for your next labour.' 'Do you mean my next deed of valour?' Philip asked. 'We have decided that all your deeds need not be deeds of valour,' said Mr. Noah, fiddling with a pen. 'The strange labours of Hercules, you remember, were some of them dangerous and some merely difficult. I have decided that difficult things shall count. There are several things that really  need  doing,' he went on half to himself. 'There's the fruit supply, and the Dwellers by the sea, and, ,  But that must wait. We try to give you as much variety as possible. Yesterday's was an out-door adventure. To-day's shall be an indoor amusement. I say to-day's but I confess that I think it not unlikely that the task I am now about to set the candidate for the post of King-Deliverer, the task, I say, which I am now about to set you, may, quite possibly, occupy some days, if not weeks of your valuable time.' 'But our people at home,' said Philip. 'It isn't that I'm afraid, really and truly it isn't, but they'll go out of their minds, not knowing what's become of us. Oh, Mr. Noah! do let us go back.' 'It's all right,' said Mr. Noah. 'However long you stay here time won't move with them. I thought I'd explained that to you.' 'But you said, , ' 'I said you'd set our clocks to the time of  your  world when you deserted your little friend. But when you had come back for her, and rescued her from the dragon, the clocks went their own time again. There's only just that time missing that happened between your coming here the second time and your killing the dragon.' 'I see,' said Philip. But he didn't. I only hope  you  do. 'You can take your time about this new job,' said Mr. Noah, 'and you may get any help you like. I shan't consider you've failed till you've been at it three months. After that the Pretenderette would be entitled to  her  chance.' 'If you're quite sure that the time here doesn't count at home,' said Philip, 'what is it, please, that we've got to do?' 'The greatest intellects of our country have for many ages occupied themselves with the problem which you are now asked to solve,' said Mr. Noah. 'Your late gaoler, Mr. Bacon-Shakespeare, has written no less than twenty-seven volumes, all in cypher, on this very subject. But as he has forgotten what cypher he used, and no one else ever knew it, his volumes are of but little use to us.' 'I see,' said Philip. And again he didn't. Mr. Noah rose to his full height, and when he stood up the children looked very small beside him. 'Now,' he said, 'I will tell you what it is that you must do. I should like to decree that your second labour should be the tidying up of this room,  all  these papers are prophecies relating to the Deliverer, but it is one of our laws that the judge must not use any public matter for his own personal benefit. So I have decided that the next labour shall be the disentangling of the Mazy Carpet. It is in the Pillared Hall of Public Amusements. I will get my hat and we will go there at once. I can tell you about it as we go.' And as they went down streets and past houses and palaces all of which Philip could now dimly remember to have built at some time or other, Mr. Noah went on: 'It is a very beautiful hall, but we have never been able to use it for public amusement or anything else. The giant who originally built this city placed in this hall a carpet so thick that it rises to your knees, and so intricately woven that none can disentangle it. It is far too thick to pass through any of the doors. It is your task to remove it.' 'Why that's as easy as easy,' said Philip. 'I'll cut it in bits and bring out a bit at a time.' 'That would be most unfortunate for you,' said Mr. Noah. 'I filed only this morning a very ancient prophecy:           'He who shall the carpet sever,              By fire or flint or steel,            Shall be fed on orange pips for ever,              And dressed in orange peel. You wouldn't like that, you know.' 'No,' said Philip grimly, 'I certainly shouldn't.' 'The carpet must be  unravelled , unwoven, so that not a thread is broken. Here is the hall.' They went up steps, Philip sometimes wished he had not been so fond of building steps, and through a dark vestibule to an arched door. Looking through it they saw a great hall and at its end a raised space, more steps, and two enormous pillars of bronze wrought in relief with figures of flying birds. 'Father's Japanese vases,' Lucy whispered. The floor of the room was covered by the carpet. It was loosely but difficultly woven of very thick soft rope of a red colour. When I say difficultly, I mean that it wasn't just straight-forward in the weaving, but the threads went over and under and round about in such a determined and bewildering way that Philip felt, and said, that he would rather untie the string of a hundred of the most difficult parcels than tackle this. 'Well,' said Mr. Noah, 'I leave you to it. Board and lodging will be provided at the Provisional Palace where you slept last night. All citizens are bound to assist when called upon. Dinner is at one.  Good -morning!' Philip sat down in the dark archway and gazed helplessly at the twisted strands of the carpet. After a moment of hesitation Lucy sat down too, clasped her arms round her knees, and she also gazed at the carpet. They had all the appearance of shipwrecked mariners looking out over a great sea and longing for a sail. 'Ha ha, tee hee!' said a laugh close behind them. They turned. And it was the motor-veiled lady, the hateful Pretenderette, who had crept up close behind them, and was looking down at them through her veil. 'What do you want?' said Philip severely. 'I want to laugh,' said the motor lady. 'I want to laugh at  you . And I'm going to.' 'Well go and laugh somewhere else then,' Philip suggested. 'Ah! but this is where I want to laugh. You and your carpet! You'll never do it. You don't know how. But  I  do.' 'Come away,' whispered Lucy, and they went. The Pretenderette followed slowly. Outside, a couple of Dutch dolls in check suits were passing, arm in arm. 'Help!' cried Lucy suddenly, and the Dutch dolls paused and took their hats off. 'What is it?' the taller doll asked, stroking his black painted moustache. 'Mr. Noah said all citizens were bound to help us,' said Lucy a little breathlessly. 'But of course,' said the shorter doll, bowing with stiff courtesy. 'Then,' said Lucy, 'will you  please  take that motor person away and put her somewhere where she can't bother till we've done the carpet?' 'Delighted,' exclaimed the agreeable Dutch strangers, darted up the steps and next moment emerged with the form of the Pretenderette between them, struggling indeed, but struggling vainly. 'You need not have the slightest further anxiety,' the taller Dutchman said; 'dismiss the incident from your mind. We will take her to the hall of justice. Her offence is bothering people in pursuit of their duty. The sentence is imprisonment for as long as the botheree chooses. Good-morning.' 'Oh,  thank you !' said both the children together. When they were alone, Philip said, and it was not easy to say it: 'That was jolly clever of you, Lucy. I should never have thought of it.' 'Oh, that's nothing,' said Lucy, looking down. 'I could do more than that.' 'What?' he asked. 'I could unravel the carpet,' said Lucy, with deep solemnity. 'But it's me that's got to do it,' Philip urged. 'Every citizen is bound to help, if called in,' Lucy reminded him. 'And I suppose a princess  is  a citizen.' 'Perhaps I can do it by myself,' said Philip. 'Try,' said Lucy, and sat down on the steps, her fairy skirts spreading out round her like a white double hollyhock. He tried. He went back and looked at the great coarse cables of the carpet. He could see no end to the cables, no beginning to his task. And Lucy just went on sitting there like a white hollyhock. And time went on, and presently became, rather urgently, dinner-time. So he went back to Lucy and said: 'All right, you can show me how to do it, if you like.' But Lucy replied: 'Not much! If you want me to help you with  this , you'll have to promise to let me help in all the other things. And you'll have to  ask  me to help, ask me politely too.' 'I shan't then,' said Philip. But in the end he had to, politely also. 'With pleasure,' said Lucy, the moment he asked her, and he could see she had been making up what she should answer, while he was making up his mind to ask. 'I shall be delighted to help you in this and all the other tasks. Say yes.' 'Yes,' said Philip, who was very hungry. ''In this and all the other tasks' say.' 'In this and all the other tasks,' he said. 'Go on. How can we do it?' 'It's  crochet ,' Lucy giggled. 'It's a little crochet mat I'd made of red wool; and I put it in the hall that night. You've just got to find the end and pull, and it all comes undone. You just want to find the end and pull.' 'It's too heavy for us to pull.' 'Well,' said Lucy, who had certainly had time to think everything out, 'you get one of those twisty round things they pull boats out of the sea with, and I'll find the end while you're getting it.' She ran up the steps and Philip looked round the buildings on the other three sides of the square, to see if any one of them looked like a capstan shop, for he understood, as of course you also have done, that a capstan was what Lucy meant. On a building almost opposite he read, 'Naval Necessaries Supply Company,' and he ran across to it. 'Rather,' said the secretary of the company, a plump sailor-doll, when Philip had explained his needs. 'I'll send a dozen men over at once. Only too proud to help, Sir Philip. The navy is always keen on helping valour and beauty.' 'I want to be brave,' said Philip, 'but I'd rather not be beautiful.' 'Of course not,' said the secretary; and added surprisingly, 'I meant the Lady Lucy.' 'Oh!' said Philip. So twelve bluejackets and a capstan outside the Hall of Public Amusements were soon the centre of a cheering crowd. Lucy had found the end of the rope, and two sailors dragged it out and attached it to the capstan, and then, round and round with a will and a breathless chanty, the carpet was swiftly unravelled. Dozens of eager helpers stood on the parts of the carpet which were not being unravelled, to keep it steady while the pulling went on. The news of Philip's success spread like wild-fire through the city, and the crowds gathered thicker and thicker. The great doors beyond the pillars with the birds on them were thrown open, and Mr. Noah and the principal citizens stood there to see the end of the unravelling. 'Bravo!' said every one in tremendous enthusiasm. 'Bravo! Sir Philip.' 'It wasn't me,' said Philip difficultly, when the crowd paused for breath; 'it was Lucy thought of it.' 'Bravo! Bravo!' shouted the crowd louder than ever. 'Bravo, for the Lady Lucy! Bravo for Sir Philip, the modest truth-teller!' [Illustration: So, all down the wide clear floor, Lucy danced.] 'Bravo, my dear,' said Mr. Noah, waving his hat and thumping Lucy on the back. 'I'm awfully glad I thought of it,' she said; 'that makes two deeds Sir Philip's done, doesn't it? Two out of the seven.' 'Yes, indeed,' said Mr. Noah enthusiastically. 'I must make him a baronet now. His title will grow grander with each deed. There's an old prophecy that the person who finds out how to unravel the carpet must be the first to dance in the Hall of Public Amusements.           'The clever one, the noble one,            Who makes the carpet come undone,            Shall be the first to dance a measure            Within the Hall of public pleasure. I suppose public  amusement  was too difficult a rhyme even for these highly-skilled poets, our astrologers. You, my child, seem to have been well inspired in your choice of a costume. Dance, then, my Lady Lucy, and let the prophecy be fulfilled.' So, all down the wide clear floor of the Hall of Public Amusement, Lucy danced. And the people of the city looked on and applauded, Philip with the rest. CHAPTER VI THE LIONS IN THE DESERT 'But why?' asked Philip at dinner, which was no painted wonder of wooden make-believe, but real roast guinea-fowl and angel pudding, 'Why do you only have wooden things to eat at your banquets?' 'Banquets are extremely important occasions,' said Mr. Noah, 'and real food, food that you can eat and enjoy, only serves to distract the mind from the serious affairs of life. Many of the most successful caterers in your world have grasped this great truth.' 'But why,' Lucy asked, 'do you have the big silver bowls with nothing in them?' Mr. Noah sighed. 'The bowls are for dessert,' he said. 'But there isn't any dessert  in  them,' Lucy objected. 'No,' said Mr. Noah, sighing again, 'that's just it. There is no dessert. There has never been any dessert. Will you have a little more angel pudding?' It was quite plain to Lucy and Philip that Mr. Noah wished to change the subject, which, for some reason, was a sad one, and with true politeness they both said 'Yes, please,' to the angel pudding offer, though they had already had quite as much as they really needed. After dinner Mr. Noah took them for a walk through the town, 'to see the factories,' he said. This surprised Philip, who had been taught not to build factories with his bricks because factories were so ugly, but the factories turned out to be pleasant, long, low houses, with tall French windows opening into gardens of roses, where people of all nations made beautiful and useful things, and loved making them. And all the people who were making them looked clean and happy. 'I wish we had factories like those,' Philip said. 'Our factories  are  so ugly. Helen says so.' 'That's because all your factories are  money  factories,' said Mr. Noah, 'though they're called by all sorts of different names. Every one here has to make something that isn't just money or  for  money, something useful  and  beautiful.' 'Even you?' said Lucy. 'Even I,' said Mr. Noah. 'What do you make?' the question was bound to come. 'Laws, of course,' Mr. Noah answered in some surprise. 'Didn't you know I was the Chief Judge?' 'But laws can't be useful and beautiful, can they?' 'They can certainly be useful,' said Mr. Noah, 'and,' he added with modest pride, 'my laws are beautiful. What do you think of this? 'Everybody must try to be kind to everybody else. Any one who has been unkind must be sorry and say so.'' 'It seems all right,' said Philip, 'but it's not exactly beautiful.' 'Oh, don't you think so?' said Mr. Noah, a little hurt; 'it mayn't  sound  beautiful perhaps, I never could write poetry, but it's quite beautiful when people do it.' 'Oh, if you mean your laws are beautiful when they're  kept ,' said Philip. 'Beautiful things can't be beautiful when they're broken, of course,' Mr. Noah explained. 'Not even laws. But ugly laws are only beautiful when they  are  broken. That's odd, isn't it? Laws are very tricky things.' 'I say,' Philip said suddenly, as they climbed one of the steep flights of steps between trees in pots, 'couldn't we do another of the deeds now? I don't feel as if I'd really done anything to-day at all. It was Lucy who did the carpet. Do tell us the next deed.' 'The next deed,' Mr. Noah answered, 'will probably take some time. There's no reason why you should not begin it to-day if you like. It is a deed peculiarly suited to a baronet. I don't know why,' he added hastily; 'it may be that it is the only thing that baronets are good for. I shouldn't wonder. The existence of baronets,' he added musingly, 'has always seemed to the thoughtful to lack justification. Perhaps this deed which you will begin to-day is the wise end to which baronets were designed.' 'Yes, I daresay,' said Philip; 'but what is the end?' 'I don't know,' Mr. Noah owned, 'but I'll tell you what the  deed  is. You've got to journey to the land of the Dwellers by the Sea and, by any means that may commend itself to you, slay their fear.' Philip naturally asked what the Dwellers by the Sea were afraid of. 'That you will learn from them,' said Mr. Noah; 'but it is a very great fear.' 'Is it something we shall be afraid of  too ?' Lucy asked. And Philip at once said, 'Oh, then she really did mean to come, did she? But she wasn't to if she was afraid. Girls weren't expected to be brave.' 'They  are , here,' said Mr. Noah, 'the girls are expected to be brave and the boys kind.' 'Oh,' said Philip doubtfully. And Lucy said: 'Of course I meant to come. You know you promised.' So that was settled. 'And now,' said Mr. Noah, rubbing his hands with the cheerful air of one who has a great deal to do and is going to enjoy doing it, 'we must fit you out a proper expedition, for the Dwellers by the Sea are a very long way off. What would you like to ride on?' 'A horse,' said Philip, truly pleased. He said horse, because he did not want to ride a donkey, and he had never seen any one ride any animal but these two. 'That's right,' Mr. Noah said, patting him on the back. 'I  was  so afraid you'd ask for a bicycle. And there's a dreadful law here, it was made by mistake, but there it is, that if any one asks for machinery they have to have it and keep on using it. But as to a horse. Well, I'm not sure. You see, you have to ride right across the pebbly waste, and it's a good three days' journey. But come along to the stables.' You know the kind of stables they would be? The long shed with stalls such as you had, when you were little, for your little wooden horses and carts? Only there were not only horses here, but every sort of animal that has ever been ridden on. Elephants, camels, donkeys, mules, bulls, goats, zebras, tortoises, ostriches, bisons, and pigs. And in the last stall of all, which was not of common wood but of beaten silver, stood the very Hippogriff himself, with his long, white mane and his long, white tail, and his gentle, beautiful eyes. His long, white wings were folded neatly on his satin-smooth back, and how he and the stall got here was more than Philip could guess. All the others were Noah's Ark animals, alive, of course, but still Noah's Arky beyond possibility of mistake. But the Hippogriff was not Noah's Ark at all. 'He came,' Mr. Noah explained, 'out of a book. One of the books you used to build your city with.' 'Can't we have  him ?' Lucy said; 'he looks such a darling.' And the Hippogriff turned his white velvet nose and nuzzled against her in affectionate acknowledgment of the compliment. 'Not if you both go,' Mr. Noah explained. 'He cannot carry more than one person at a time unless one is an Earl. No, if I may advise, I should say go by camel.' 'Can the camel carry two?' 'Of course. He is called the ship of the desert,' Mr. Noah informed them, 'and a ship that wouldn't carry more than one would be simply silly.' So  that  was settled. Mr. Noah himself saddled and bridled the camel, which was a very large one, with his own hands. 'Let me see,' he said, standing thoughtful with the lead rope in his hand, 'you'll be wanting dogs, ' 'I  always  want dogs,' said Philip warmly. ', to use in emergencies.' He whistled and two Noah's Ark dogs leaped from their kennels to their chains' end. They were dachshunds, very long and low, and very alike except that one was a little bigger and a little browner than the other. 'This is your master and that's your mistress,' Mr. Noah explained to the dogs, and they fawned round the children. 'Then you'll want things to eat and things to drink and tents and umbrellas in case of bad weather, and, ,  But let's turn down this street; just at the corner we shall find exactly what we want.' It was a shop that said outside 'Universal Provider. Expeditions fitted out at a moment's notice. Punctuality and dispatch.' The shopkeeper came forward politely. He was so exactly like Mr. Noah that the children knew who he was even before he said, 'Well, father,' and Mr. Noah said, 'This is my son: he has had some experience in outfits.' 'What have you got to start with?' the son asked, getting to business at once. 'Two dogs, two children, and a camel,' said Mr. Noah. 'Yes, I know it's customary to have two of everything, but I assure you, my dear boy, that one camel is as much as Sir Philip can manage. It is indeed.' Mr. Noah's son very dutifully supposed that his father knew best and willingly agreed to provide everything that was needed for the expedition, including one best-quality talking parrot, and to deliver all goods, carefully packed, within half an hour.       .       .       .       .       .       .       . So now you see Philip, and Lucy who still wore her fairy dress, packed with all their belongings on the top of a very large and wobbly camel, and being led out of the city by the usual procession, with seven bands of music all playing 'See the Conquering Hero goes,' quite a different tune from the one you know, which has a name a little like that. The camel and its load were rather a tight fit for the particular gateway that they happened to go out by, and the children had to stoop to avoid scraping their heads against the top of the arch. But they got through all right, and now they were well on the road which was really little more than a field path running through the flowery meadow country where the dragon had been killed. They saw the Stonehenge ruins and the big tower far away to the left, and in front lay the vast and interesting expanse of the Absolutely Unknown. The sun was shining, there was a sun, and Mr. Noah had told the children that it came out of the poetry books, together with rain and flowers and the changing seasons, and in spite of the strange, almost-tumble-no-it's-all-right-but-you'd-better-look-out way in which the camel walked, the two travellers were very happy. The dogs bounded along in the best of spirits, and even the camel seemed less a prey than usual to that proud melancholy which you must have noticed in your visits to the Zoo as his most striking quality. It was certainly very grand to ride on a camel, and Lucy tried not to think how difficult it would be to get on and off. The parrot was interesting too. It talked extremely well. Of course you understand that, if you can only make a parrot understand, it can tell you everything you want to know about other animals; because it understands  their  talk quite naturally and without being made. The present parrot declined ordinary conversation, and when questioned only recited poetry of a rather dull kind that went on and on. 'Arms and the man I sing' it began, and then something about haughty Juno. Its voice was soothing, and riding on the camel was not unlike being rocked in a very bumpety cradle. The children were securely seated in things like padded panniers, and they had had an exciting day. As the sun set, which it did quite soon, the parrot called out to the nearest dog, 'I say, Max, they're asleep.' [Illustration: On the top of a very large and wobbly camel.] 'I don't wonder,' said Max. 'But it's all right. Humpty knows the way.' 'Keep a civil tongue in your head, you young dog, can't you?' said the camel grumpily. 'Don't be cross, darling,' said the other dog, whose name was Brenda, 'and be sure you stop at a really first-class oasis for the night. But I know we can trust  you , dear.' The camel muttered that it was all very well, but his voice was not quite as cross as before. After that the expedition went on in silence through the deepening twilight. A tumbling, shaking, dumping sensation, more like a soft railway accident than anything else, awakened our travellers, and they found that the camel was kneeling down. 'Off you come,' said the parrot, 'and make the fire and boil the kettle.' 'Polly put the kettle on,' Lucy said absently, as she slid down to the ground; to which the parrot replied, 'Certainly not. I wish you wouldn't rake up that old story. It was quite false. I never did put a kettle on, and I never will.' Why should I describe to you the adventure of camping at an oasis in a desert? You must all have done it many times; or if you have not done it, you have read about it. You know all about the well and the palm trees and the dates and things. They had cocoa for supper. It was great fun, and they slept soundly and awoke in the morning with a heart for any fate, as a respectable poet puts it. The next day was just the same as the first, only instead of going through fresh green fields, the way lay through dry yellow desert. And again the children slept, and again the camel chose an oasis with remarkable taste and judgment. But the second night was not at all the same as the first. For in the middle of it the parrot awakened Philip by biting his ear, and then hopping to a safe distance from his awakening fists and crying out, 'Make up the camp fire, look alive. It's lions.' The dogs were whining and barking, and Brenda was earnestly trying to climb a palm tree. Max faced the danger, it is true, but he seemed to have no real love of sport. Philip sprang up and heaped dead palm scales and leaves on the dying fire. It blazed up and something moved beyond the bushes. Philip wondered whether those pairs of shining things, like strayed stars, that he saw in the darkness, could really be the eyes of lions. 'What a nuisance these lions are to be sure,' said the parrot. 'No, they won't come near us while the fire's burning, but really, they ought to be put down by law.' 'Why doesn't somebody kill them?' Lucy asked. She had wakened when Philip did, and, after a meditative minute, had helped with the palm scales and things. 'It's not so easy,' said the parrot; 'nobody knows how to do it. How would  you  kill a lion?' ' I  don't know,' said Philip; but Lucy said, 'Are they Noah's Ark lions?' 'Of course they are,' said Polly; 'all the books with lions in them are kept shut up.' 'I know how you could kill Noah's Ark lions if you could catch them,' Lucy said. 'It's easy enough to catch them,' said Polly; 'an hour after dawn they go to sleep, but it's unsportsmanlike to kill game when it's asleep.' 'I'm going to think, if you don't mind,' Lucy announced, and sat down very near the fire. 'It's just the opposite of the dragon,' she said after a minute. The parrot nodded and there was a long silence. Then suddenly Lucy jumped up. 'I know,' she cried, 'oh, I really  do  know. And it won't hurt them either. I don't a bit mind killing things, but I do hate hurting them. There's plenty of rope, I know.' There was. 'Then when it's dawn we'll tie them up and then you'll see.' 'I think you might tell  me ,' said Philip, injured. 'No, they may understand what we say. Polly does.' Philip made a natural suggestion. But Lucy replied that it was not manners to whisper, and the parrot said that it should think not indeed. So, sitting by the fire, all faces turned to where those strange twin stars shone and those strange hidden movements and rustlings stirred, the expedition waited for the dawn. Brenda had given up the tree-climbing idea, and was cuddling up as close to Lucy as possible. The camel, who had been trembling with fear all the while, tried to cuddle up to Philip, which would have been easier if it had been a smaller kind instead of being, as it was, what Mr. Noah's son, the Universal Provider, had called, 'an out size in camels.' And presently dawn came, not slow and silvery as dawns come here, but sudden and red, with strong level lights and the shadows of the palm trees stretching all across the desert. In broad daylight it did not seem so hard to have to go and look for the lions. They all went, even the camel pulled himself together to join the lion-hunt, and Brenda herself decided to come rather than be left alone. The lions were easily found. There were only two of them, of course, and they were lying close together, each on its tawny side on the sandy desert at the edge of the oasis. Very gently the ropes, with slip knots, were fitted over their heads, and the other end of the rope passed round a palm tree. Other ropes round the trees were passed round what would have been the waists of the lions if lions had such things as waists. 'Now!' whispered Lucy, and at once all four ropes were pulled tight. The lions struggled, but only in their sleep. And soon they were still. Then with more and more ropes their legs and tails were made fast. 'And that's all right,' said Lucy, rather out of breath. 'Where's Polly?' 'Here,' replied that bird from a neighbouring bush. 'I thought I should only be in the way if I kept close to you. But I longed to lend a claw in such good work. Can I help  now ?' 'Will you please explain to the dogs?' said Lucy. 'It's their turn now. The only way I know to kill Noah's Ark lions is to  lick the paint off  and break their legs. And if the dogs lick all the paint off their legs they won't feel it when we break them.' Polly hastened to explain to the dogs, and then turned again to Lucy. 'They asked if you're sure the ropes will hold, and I've told them of course. So now they're going to begin. I only hope the paint won't make them ill.' 'It never did me,' said Lucy. 'I sucked the dove quite clean one Sunday, and it wasn't half bad. Tasted of sugar a little and eucalyptus oil like they give you when you've got a cold. Tell them that, Polly.' Polly did, and added, 'I will recite poetry to them to hearten them to their task.' 'Do,' said Philip heartily, 'it may make them hurry up. But perhaps you'd better tell them that we shall pinch their tails if they happen to go to sleep.' Then the children had a cocoa-and-date breakfast. (All expeditions seem to live mostly on cocoa, and when they come back they often write to the cocoa makers to say how good it was and they don't know what they would have done without it.) And the noble and devoted dogs licked and licked and licked, and the paint began to come off the lions' legs like anything. It was heavy work turning the lions over so as to get at the other or unlicked side, but the expedition worked with a will, and the lions resisted but feebly, being still asleep, and, besides, weak from loss of paint. And the dogs had a drink given them and were patted and praised, and set to work again. And they licked and licked for hours and hours. And in the end all the paint was off the lions' legs, and Philip chopped them off with the explorer's axe which that experienced Provider, Mr. Noah's son, had thoughtfully included in the outfit of the expedition. And as he chopped the chips flew, and Lucy picked one up, and it was  wood , just wood and nothing else, though when they had tied it up it had been real writhing resisting lion-leg and no mistake. And when all the legs were chopped off, Philip put his hand on a lion body, and that was wood too. So the lions were dead indeed. [Illustration: It was heavy work turning the lions over.] 'It seems a pity,' he said. 'Lions are such jolly beasts when they are alive.' 'I never cared for lions myself,' said Polly; and Lucy said, 'Never mind, Phil. It didn't hurt them anyway.' And that was the first time she ever called him Phil. 'All right, Lu,' said Philip. 'It was jolly clever of you to think of it anyhow.' And that was the first time he ever called her Lu.       .       .       .       .       .       .       . They saw the straight pale line of the sea for a long time before they came to the place of the Dwellers by the Sea. For these people had built their castle down on the very edge of the sea, and the Pebbly Waste rose and rose to a mountain that hid their castle from the eyes of the camel-riders who were now drawing near to the scene of their next deed. The Pebbly Waste was all made of small slippery stones, and the children understood how horrid a horse would have found it. Even the camel went very slowly, and the dogs no longer frisked and bounded, but went at a foot's pace with drooping ears and tails. 'I should call a halt, if I were you,' said Polly. 'We shall all be the better for a cup of cocoa. And besides, , ' Polly refused to explain this dark hint and only added, 'Look out for surprises.' 'I thought,' said Philip, draining the last of his second mug of cocoa, 'I thought there were no birds in the desert except you, and you're more a person than a bird. But look there.' Far away across the desert a moving speck showed, high up in the blue air. It grew bigger and bigger, plainly coming towards the camp. It was as big as a moth now, now as big as a teacup, now as big as an eagle, and, ,  'But it's got four legs,' said Lucy. 'Yes,' said the parrot; 'it would have, you know. It is the Hippogriff.' It was indeed that magnificent wonder. Flying through the air with long sweeps of his great white wings, the Hippogriff drew nearer and nearer, bearing on his back, what? 'It's the Pretenderette,' cried Lucy, and at the same moment Philip said, 'It's that nasty motor thing.' It was. The Hippogriff dropped from the sky to the desert below as softly as a butterfly alighting on a flower, and stood there in all his gracious whiteness. And on his back was the veiled motor lady. 'So glad I've caught you up,' she said in that hateful voice of hers; 'now we can go on together.' 'I don't see what you wanted to come at all for,' said Philip downrightly. 'Oh,  don't  you?' she said, sitting up there on the Hippogriff with her horrid motor veil fluttering in the breeze from the now hidden sea. 'Why, of course, I have a right to be present at all experiments. There ought to be some responsible grown-up person to see that you really do what you're sure to say you've done.' 'Do you mean that we're liars?' Philip asked hotly. 'I don't mean to  say  anything about it,' the Pretenderette answered with an unpleasant giggle, 'but a grown-up person ought to be present.' She added something about a parcel of birds and children. And the parrot ruffled his feathers till he looked twice his proper size. Philip said he didn't see it. 'Oh, but  I  do,' said the Pretenderette; 'if you fail, then it's my turn, and I might very likely succeed the minute after you'd failed. So we'll all go on comfortably together.  Won't  that be nice?' A speechless despair seemed to have fallen on the party. Nobody spoke. The children looked blank, the dogs whined, the camel put on his haughtiest sneer, and the parrot fidgeted in his fluffed-out feather dress. 'Let's be starting,' said the motor lady. 'Gee-up, pony!' A shiver ran through every one present. That a Pretenderette should dare to speak so to a Hippogriff! Suddenly the parrot spread its wings and flew to perch on Philip's shoulder. It whispered in his ear. 'Whispering is not manners, I know,' it said, 'but your own generous heart will excuse me. 'Parcel of birds and children.' Doesn't your blood boil?' Philip thought it did. 'Well, then,' said the bird impatiently, 'what are we waiting for? You've only got to say the word and I'll take her back by the ear.' 'I wish you would,' said Philip from the heart. 'Nothing easier,' said the parrot, 'the miserable outsider! Intruding into  our  expedition! I advise you to await my return here. Or if I am not back by the morning there will be no objection to your calling, about noon, on the Dwellers. I can rejoin you there. Good-bye.' It stroked his ear with a gentle and kindly beak and flew into the air and circled three times round the detested motor lady's head. 'Get away,' she cried, flapping her hands furiously; 'call your silly Poll-parrot off, can't you?' And then she screamed, 'Oh! it's got hold of my ear!' 'Oh, don't hurt her,' said Lucy. 'I will not hurt her;' the parrot let the ear go on purpose to say this, and the Pretenderette covered both ears with her hands. 'You person in the veil, I shall take hold again in a moment. And it will hurt you much less if the Hippogriff and I happen to be flying in the same direction. See? If I were you I should just say 'Go back the way you came, please,' to the Hippogriff, and then I shall hardly hurt you at all. Don't think of getting off. If you do, the dogs will have you. Keep your hands over your ears if you like. I know you can hear me well enough. Now I am going to take hold of you again. Keep your hands where they are. I'm not particular to an ear or so. A nose will do just as well.' The person on the Hippogriff put both hands to her nose. Instantly the parrot had her again by the ear. 'Go back the way you came,' she cried; 'but I'll be even with you children yet.' The Hippogriff did not move. 'Let go my ear,' screamed the lady. 'You'll have to say please, you know,' said Philip; 'not to the bird, I don't mean that: that's no good. But to the Hippogriff.' ' Please  then,' said the lady in a burst of temper, and instantly the white wings parted and spread and the Hippogriff rose in the air. Polly let the ear go for the moment to say: 'I shan't hurt her so long as she behaves,' and then took hold again and his little grey wings and the big white wings of the Hippogriff went sailing away across the desert. 'What a treasure of a parrot?' said Philip. But Lucy said: 'Who  is  that Pretenderette? Why is she so horrid to us when every one else is so nice?' 'I don't know,' said Philip, 'hateful old thing.' 'I can't help feeling as if I knew her quite well, if I could only remember who she is.' 'Do you?' said Philip. 'I say, let's play noughts and crosses. I've got a notebook and a bit of pencil in my pocket. We might play till it's time to go to sleep.' So they played noughts and crosses on the Pebbly Waste, and behind them the parrot and the Hippogriff took away the tiresome one, and in front of them lay the high pebble ridge that was like a mountain, and beyond that was the unknown and the adventure and the Dwellers and the deed to be done. CHAPTER VII THE DWELLERS BY THE SEA You soon get used to things. It seemed quite natural and homelike to Philip to be wakened in bright early out-of-door's morning by the gentle beak of the parrot at his ear. 'You got back all right then,' he said sleepily. 'It was rather a long journey,' said the parrot, 'but I thought it better to come back by wing. The Hippogriff offered to bring me; he is the soul of courteous gentleness. But he was tired too. The Pretenderette is in gaol for the moment, but I'm afraid she'll get out again; we're so unused to having prisoners, you see. And it's no use putting  her  on her honour, because, , ' 'Because she hasn't any,' Philip finished. 'I wouldn't say  that ,' said the parrot, 'of anybody. I'd only say we haven't come across it. What about breakfast?' 'How meals do keep happening,' said Lucy, yawning; 'it seems only a few minutes since supper. And yet here we are, hungry again!' 'Ah!' said the parrot, 'that's what people always feel when they have to get their meals themselves!' When the camel and the dogs had been served with breakfast, the children and the parrot sat down to eat. And there were many questions to ask. The parrot answered some, and some it didn't answer. 'But there's one thing,' said Lucy, 'I do most awfully want to know. About the Hippogriff. How did it get out of the book?' 'It's a long story,' said the parrot, 'so I'll tell it shortly. That's a very good rule. Tell short stories longly and long stories shortly. Many years ago, in repairing one of the buildings, the masons removed the supports of one of the books which are part of the architecture. The book fell. It fell open, and out came the Hippogriff. Then they saw something struggling under the next page and lifted it, and out came a megatherium. So they shut the book and built it into the wall again.' 'But how did the megawhatsitsname and the Hippogriff come to be the proper size?' 'Ah! that's one of the eleven mysteries. Some sages suppose that the country gave itself a sort of shake and everything settled down into the size it ought to be. I think myself that it's the air. The moment you breathe this enchanted air you become the right size.  You  did, you know.' 'But why did they shut the book?' 'It was a book of beasts. Who knows what might have come out next? A tiger perhaps. And ravening for its prey as likely as not.' 'I see,' said Philip; 'and of course beasts weren't really  needed , because of there being all the Noah's Ark ones.' 'Yes,' said the parrot, 'so they shut the book.' 'But the weather came out of books?' 'That was another book, a poetry book. It had only one cover, so everything that was on the last page got out naturally. We got a lot out of that page, rain and sun and sky and clouds, mountains, gardens, roses, lilies, flowers in general, 'Blossoms of delight' they were called in the book and trees and the sea, and the desert and silver and iron, as much of all of them as anybody could possibly want. There are no limits to poets' imaginations, you know.' 'I see,' said Lucy, and took a large bite of cake. 'And where did you come from, Polly, dear?' 'I,' said the parrot modestly, 'came out of the same book as the Hippogriff. We were on the same page. My wings entitled me to associate with him, of course, but I have sometimes thought they just put me in as a contrast. My smallness, his greatness; my red and green, his white.' 'I see,' said Lucy again, 'and please will you tell us, , ' 'Enough of this,' said the parrot; 'business before pleasure. You have begun the day with the pleasures of my conversation. You will have to work very hard to pay for this privilege.' So they washed up the breakfast things in warm water obligingly provided by the camel. 'And now,' said the parrot, 'we must pack up and go on our way to destroy the fear of the Dwellers by the Sea.' 'I wonder,' Brenda said to Max in an undertone, 'I wonder whether it wouldn't be best for dear little dogs to lose themselves? We could turn up later, and be so  very  glad to be found.' 'But why?' Max asked. 'I've noticed,' said Brenda, sidling up to him with eager affectionateness, 'that wherever there's fear there's something to be afraid of, even if it's only your fancy. It would be dreadful for dear little dogs to be afraid, Max, wouldn't it? So undignified.' 'My dear,' said Max heavily, 'I could give seven noble reasons for being faithful to our master. But I will only give you one. There is nothing to eat in the desert, and nothing to drink.' 'You always were so noble, dearest,' said Brenda; 'so different from poor little me. I've only my affectionate nature. I know I'm only a silly little thing.' So when the camel lurched forward and the parrot took wing, the dogs followed closely. 'Dear faithful things,' said Lucy. 'Brenda! Max! Nice dogs!' And the dogs politely responding, bounded enthusiastically. The journey was not long. Quite soon they found a sort of ravine or gully in the cliff, and a path that led through it. And then they were on the beach, very pebbly with small stones, and there was the home of the Dwellers by the Sea; and beyond it, broad and blue and beautiful, the sea by which they dwelt. The Dwelling seemed to be a sort of town of rounded buildings more like lime-kilns than anything else, with arched doors leading to dark insides. They were all built of tiny stones, such as lay on the beach. Beyond the huts or houses towered the castle, a vast rough structure with towers and arches and buttresses and bastions and glacis and bridges and a great moat all round it. 'But I never built a city like that, did you?' Lucy asked as they drew near. 'No,' Philip answered; 'at least, do you know, I do believe it's the sand castle Helen and I built last summer at Dymchurch. And those huts are the moulds I made of my pail, with the edges worn off, you know.' Towards the castle the travellers advanced, the camel lurching like a boat on a rough sea, and the dogs going with cat-like delicacy over the stones. They skirted large pools and tall rocks seaweed covered. Along a road broad enough for twelve chariots to have driven on it abreast, slowly they came to the great gate of the castle. And as they got nearer, they saw at every window heads leaning out; every battlement, every terrace, was crowded with figures. And when they were quite near, by throwing their heads very far back, so that their necks felt quite stiff for quite a long time afterwards, the children could see that all those people seemed quite young, and seemed to have very odd and delightful clothes, just a garment from shoulder to knee made, as it seemed, of dark fur. [Illustration: Slowly they came to the great gate of the castle.] 'What lots of them there are,' said Philip; 'where did they come from?' 'Out of a book,' said the parrot; 'but the authorities were very prompt that time. Only a line and a half got out.           'Happy troops            Of gentle islanders. Those are the islanders.' 'Then why,' asked Philip naturally, 'aren't they on an island?' 'There's only one island, and no one is allowed on that except two people who never go there. But the islanders are happy even if they don't live on an island, always happy, except for the great fear.' Here the travellers began to cross one of the bridges across the moat, the bridge, in fact, which led to the biggest arch of all. It was a very rough arch, like the entrance to a cave. And from out its dark mouth came a little crowd of people. 'They're savages,' said Lucy, shrinking till she seemed only an extra hump on the camel's back. They were indeed of a dark complexion, sunburnt in fact, but their faces were handsome and kindly. They waved friendly hands and smiled in the most agreeable and welcoming way. The tallest islander stepped out from the crowd. He was about as big as Philip. 'They're not savages,' said Philip; 'don't be a donkey. They're just children.' 'Hush!' said the parrot; 'the Lord High Islander is now about to begin the state address of welcome!' He was. And this was the address. 'How jolly of you to come. Do get down off that camel and come indoors and have some grub. Jim, you might take that camel round to the stable and rub him down a bit. You'd like to keep the dogs with you, of course. And what about the parrot?' 'Thanks awfully,' Philip responded, and slid off the camel, followed by Lucy; 'the parrot will make his own mind up, he always does.' They all trooped into the hall of the castle which was more like a cave than a hall and very dark, for the windows were little and high up. As Lucy's eyes got used to the light she perceived that the clothes of the islanders were not of skins but of seaweed. 'I asked you in,' said the Lord High Islander, a jolly-looking boy of about Philip's age, 'out of politeness. But really it isn't dinner time, and the meet is in half an hour. So, unless you're really hungry, , ?' The children said 'Not at all!' 'You hunt, of course?' the Lord High Islander said; 'it's really the only sport we get here, except fishing. Of course we play games and all that. I do hope you won't be dull.' 'We came here on business,' the parrot remarked, and the happy islanders crowded round to see him, remarking, 'these are Philip and Lucy, claimants to the Deliverership. They are doing their deeds, you know,' the parrot ended. Lucy whispered, 'It's really  Philip  who is the claimant, not me; only the parrot's so polite.' The Lord High Islander frowned. 'We can talk about that afterwards,' he said; 'it's a pity to waste time now.' 'What do you hunt?' Philip asked. 'All the different kinds of graibeeste and the vertoblancs; and the blugraiwee, when we can find him,' said the Lord High Islander. 'But he's very scarce. Pinkuggers are more common, and much bigger, of course. Well, you'll soon see. If your camel's not quite fresh I can mount you both. What kind of animal do you prefer?' 'What do you ride?' Philip asked. It appeared that the Lord High Islander rode a giraffe, and Philip longed to ride another. But Lucy said she would rather ride what she was used to, thank you. When they got out into the courtyard of the castle, they found it full of a crowd of animals, any of which you may find in the Zoo, or in your old Noah's ark if it was a sufficiently expensive one to begin with, and if you have not broken or lost too many of the inhabitants. Each animal had its rider and the party rode out on to the beach. 'What  is  it they hunt?' Philip asked the parrot, who had perched on his shoulder. 'All the little animals in the Noah's ark that haven't any names,' the parrot told him. 'All those are considered fair game. Hullo! blugraiwee!' it shouted, as a little grey beast with blue spots started from the shelter of a rock and made for the cover of a patch of giant seaweed. Then all sorts of little animals got up and scurried off into places of security. 'There goes a vertoblanc,' said the parrot, pointing to a bright green animal of uncertain shape, whose breast and paws were white, 'and there's a graibeeste.' The graibeeste was about as big as a fox, and had rabbit's ears and the unusual distinction of a tail coming out of his back just half-way between one end of him and the other. But there are graibeestes of all sorts and shapes. [Illustration: 'If your camel's not quite fresh I can mount you both.'] You know when people are making the animals for Noah's arks they make the big ones first, elephants and lions and tigers and so on, and paint them as nearly as they can the right colours. Then they get weary of copying nature and begin to paint the animals pink and green and chocolate colour, which in nature is not the case. These are the chockmunks, and vertoblancs and the pinkuggers. And presently the makers get sick of the whole business and make the animals any sort of shape and paint them all one grey, these are the graibeestes. And at the very end a guilty feeling of having been slackers comes over the makers of the Noah's arks, and they paint blue spots on the last and littlest of the graibeestes to ease their consciences. This is the blugraiwee. 'Tally Ho! Hark forrad! Yoicks!' were some of the observations now to be heard on every side as the hunt swept on, the blugraiwee well ahead. Dogs yapped, animals galloped, riders shouted, the sun shone, the sea sparkled, and far ahead the blugraiwee ran, extended to his full length like a grey straight line. He was killed five miles from the castle after a splendid run. And when a pinkugger had been secured and half a dozen graibeeste, the hunt rode slowly home. 'We only hunt to kill and we only kill for food,' the Lord High Islander said. 'But,' said Philip, 'I thought Noah's ark animals turned into wood when they were dead?' 'Not if you kill for food. The intention makes all the difference. I had a plum-cake intention when we put up the blugraiwee, the pinkugger I made a bread and butter intention about, and the graibeestes I intended for rice pudding and prunes and toffee and ices and all sorts of odd things. So, of course, when we come to cut them up they'll  be  what I intended.' 'I see,' said Philip, jogging along on his camel. 'I say,' he added, 'you don't mind my asking, how is it you're all children here?' 'Well,' said the Lord High Islander, 'it's ancient history, so I don't suppose it's true. But they say that when the government had to make sure that we should always be  happy  troops of gentle islanders, they decided that the only way was for us to be children. And we do have the most ripping time. And we do our own hunting and cooking and wash up our own plates and things, and for heavy work we have the M.A.'s. They're men who've had to work at sums and history and things at College so hard that they want a holiday. So they come here and work for us, and if any of us do want to learn anything, the M.A.'s are handy to have about the place. It pleases them to teach anything, poor things. They live in the huts. There's always a long list waiting for their turn. Oh yes, they wear the seaweed dress the same as we do. And they hunt on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. They hunt big game, the fierce ambergris who is grey with a yellow stomach and the bigger graibeestes. Now we'll have dinner the minute we get in, and then we must talk about It.' The game was skinned and cut up in the courtyard, and the intentions of the Lord High Islander had certainly been carried out. For the blugraiwee was plum-cake, and the other animals just what was needed. And after dinner the Lord High Islander took Lucy and Philip up on to the top of the highest tower, and the three lay in the sun eating toffee and gazing out over the sea at the faint distant blue of the island. 'The island where we aren't allowed to go,' as the Lord High Islander sadly pointed out. 'Now,' said Lucy gently, 'you won't mind telling us what you're afraid of? Don't mind telling us.  We're  afraid too; we're afraid of all sorts of things quite often.' 'Speak for yourself,' said Philip, but not unkindly. 'I'm not so jolly often afraid as you seem to think. Go ahead, my Lord.' 'You might as well call me Billy,' said the Lord High Islander; 'it's my name.' 'Well, Billy, then. What is it you're afraid of?' 'I hate being afraid,' said Billy angrily. 'Of course I know no true boy is afraid of anything except doing wrong. One of the M.A.'s told me that. But the M.A.'s are afraid too.' 'What of?' Lucy asked, glancing at the terrace below, where already the shadows were lengthening; 'it'll be getting dark soon. I'd much rather know what you're afraid of while it's daylight.' 'What we're afraid of,' said Billy abruptly, 'is the sea. Suppose a great wave came and washed away the castle, and the huts, and the M.A.'s and all of us?' 'But it never  has , has it?' Lucy asked. 'No, but everything must have a beginning. I know that's true, because another of the M.A.'s told it me.' 'But why don't you go and live somewhere inland?' 'Because we couldn't live away from the sea. We're islanders, you know; we couldn't bear not to be near the sea. And we'd rather be afraid of it, than not have it to be afraid of. But it upsets the government, because we ought to be  happy  troops of gentle islanders, and you can't be quite happy if you're afraid. That's why it's one of your deeds to take away our fear.' 'It sounds jolly difficult,' said Philip; 'I shall have to think,' he added desperately. So he lay and thought with Max and Brenda asleep by his side and the parrot preening its bright feathers on the parapet of the tower, while Lucy and the Lord High Islander played cat's cradle with a long thread of seaweed. 'It's supper time,' said Billy at last. 'Have you thought of anything?' 'Not a single thing,' said Philip. 'Well, don't swat over it any more,' said Billy; 'just stay with us and have a jolly time. You're sure to think of something. Or else Lucy will. We'll act charades to-night.' They did. The rest of the islanders were an extremely jolly lot, and all the M.A.'s came out of their huts to be audience. It was a charming evening, and ended up with hide-and-seek all over the castle. To wake next morning on a bed of soft, dry, sweet-smelling seaweed, and to know that the day was to be spent in having a good time with the jolliest set of children she had ever met, was delightful to Lucy. Philip's delight was dashed by the knowledge that he must, sooner or later,  think . But the day passed most agreeably. They all bathed in the rock pools, picked up shell-fish for dinner, played rounders in the afternoon, and in the evening danced to the music made by the M.A.'s who most of them carried flutes in their pockets, and who were all very flattered at being asked to play. So the pleasant days went on. Every morning Philip said to himself, 'Now to-day I really  must  think of something,' and every night he said, 'I really ought to have thought of something.' But he never could think of anything to take away the fear of the gentle islanders. It was on the sixth night that the storm came. The wind blew and the sea roared and the castle shook to its very foundations. And Philip, awakened by the noise and the shaking, sat up in bed and understood what the fear was that spoiled the happiness of the Dwellers by the Sea. 'Suppose the sea did sweep us all away,' he said; 'and they haven't even got a boat.' And then, when he was quite far from expecting it, he did think of something. And he went on thinking about it so hard that he couldn't sleep any more. And in the morning he said to the parrot: 'I've thought of something. And I'm not going to tell the others. But I can't do it all by myself. Do you think you could get Perrin for me?' 'I will try with pleasure,' replied the obliging bird, and flew off without further speech. That afternoon, just as a picnic tea was ending, a great shadow fell on the party, and next moment the Hippogriff alighted with Mr. Perrin and the parrot on its back. 'Oh,  thank  you,' said Philip, and led Mr. Perrin away and began to talk to him in whispers. 'No, sir,' Mr. Perrin answered suddenly and aloud. 'I'm sorry, but I couldn't think of it.' 'Don't you know  how ?' Philip asked. 'I know everything as is to be known in my trade,' said Mr. Perrin, 'but carpentry's one thing, and manners is another. Not but what I know manners too, which is why I won't be a party to no such a thing.' 'But you don't understand,' said Philip, trying to keep up with Mr. Perrin's long strides. 'What I want to do is for you to build a Noah's ark on the top of the highest tower. Then when the sea's rough and the wind blows, all the Sea-Dwellers can just get into their ark and then they'll be quite safe whatever happens.' 'You said all that afore,' said Mr. Perrin, 'and I wonder at you, so I do.' 'I thought it was  such  a good idea,' said poor Philip in gloom. 'Oh, the  idea's  all right,' said Mr. Perrin; 'there ain't nothing to complain of 'bout the  idea .' 'Then what  is  wrong?' Philip asked impatiently. 'You've come to the wrong shop,' said Mr. Perrin slowly. 'I ain't the man to take away another chap's job, not if he was to be in the humblest way of business; but when it comes to slapping the government in the face, well, there, Master Pip, I wouldn't have thought it of you. It's as much as my place is worth.' 'Look here,' said Philip, stopping short in despair, 'will you tell me straight out why you won't help me?' 'I'm not a-going to go building arks, at my time of life,' said Mr. Perrin. 'Mr. Noah'd break his old heart, so he would, if I was to take on his job over his head.' 'Oh, you mean I ought to ask him?' 'Course you ought to ask him. I don't mind lending a hand under his directions, acting as foreman like, so as to make a good job of it. But it's him you must give your order to.' The parrot and the Hippogriff between them managed to get Mr. Noah to the castle by noon of the next day. 'Would you have minded,' Philip immediately asked him, 'if I'd had an ark built without asking you to do it?' 'Well,' said Mr. Noah mildly, 'I might have been a little hurt. I have had some experience, you know, my Lord.' 'Why do you call me that?' Philip asked. 'Because you are, of course. Your deed of slaying the lions counts one to you, and by virtue of it you are now a Baron. I congratulate you, Lord Leo,' said Mr. Noah. He approved of Philip's idea, and he and Perrin were soon busy making plans, calculating strains and selecting materials. Then Philip made a speech to the islanders and explained his idea. There was a great deal of cheering and shouting, and every one agreed that an ark on the topmost tower would meet a long-felt want, and that when once that ark was there, fear would for ever be a stranger to every gentle island heart. And now the great work of building began. Mr. Perrin kindly consented to act as foreman and set to work a whole army of workmen, the M.A.'s of course. And soon the sound of saw and hammer mingled with the plash of waves and cries of sea-birds, and gangs of stalwart M.A.'s in their seaweed tunics bent themselves to the task of shaping great timbers and hoisting them to the top of the highest tower, where other gangs, under Mr. Noah's own eye, reared a scaffolding to support the ark while the building went on. The children were not allowed to help, but they loved looking on, and almost felt that, if they looked on earnestly enough, they must, in some strange mysterious way, be actually helping. You know the feeling, I daresay. The Hippogriff, who was stabled in the castle, flew up to wherever he was wanted, to assist in the hauling. Mr. Noah only had to whisper the magic word in his ear and up he flew. But what that magic word was the children did not know, though they asked often enough. And now at last the ark was finished, the scaffolding was removed, and there was the great Noah's ark, firmly planted on the topmost tower. It was a perfect example of the ark-builder's craft. Its boat part was painted a dull red, its sides and ends were blue with black windows, and its roof was bright scarlet, painted in lines to imitate tiles. No least detail was neglected. Even to the white bird painted on the roof, which you must have noticed in your own Noah's ark. [Illustration: They loved looking on.] A great festival was held, speeches were made, and every one who had lent a hand in the building, even the humblest M.A., was crowned with a wreath of fresh pink and green seaweed. Songs were sung, and the laureate of the Sea-Dwellers, a young M.A. with pale blue eyes and no chin, recited an ode beginning,            Now that we have our Noble Ark           No more we tremble in the dark           When the great seas and the winds cry out,           For we are safe without a doubt.           At undue risings of the tide           Within our Ark we'll safely hide,           And bless the names of those who thus           Have built a painted Ark for us. There were three hundred and seventeen more lines, very much like these, and every one said it was wonderful, and the laureate was a genius, and how did he do it, and what brains, eh? and things like that. And Philip and Lucy had crowns too. The Lord High Islander made a vote of thanks to Philip, who modestly replied that it was nothing, really, and anybody could have done it. And a spirit of gladness spread about among the company so that every one was smiling and shaking hands with everybody else, and even the M.A.'s were making little polite old jokes, and slapping each other on the back and calling each other 'old chap,' which was not at all their habit in ordinary life. The whole castle was decorated with garlands of pink and green seaweed like the wreaths that people were wearing, and the whole scene was the gayest and happiest you can imagine. And then the dreadful thing happened. Philip and Lucy were standing in their seaweed tunics, for of course they had, since the first day, worn the costume of the country, on the platform in the courtyard. Mr. Noah had just said, 'Well, then, we will enjoy this enjoyable day to the very end and return to the city to-morrow,' when a shadow fell on the group. It was the Hippogriff, and on its back was, some one. Before any one could see who that some one was, the Hippogriff had flown low enough for that some one to catch Philip by his seaweed tunic and to swing him off his feet and on to the Hippogriff's back. Lucy screamed, Mr. Perrin said, 'Here, I say, none of that,' and Mr. Noah said, 'Dear me!' And they all reached out their hands to pull Philip back. But they were all too late. 'I won't go. Put me down,' Philip shouted. They all heard that. And also they heard the answer of the person on the Hippogriff, the person who had snatched Philip on to its back. 'Oh, won't you, my Lord? We'll soon see about that,' the person said. Three people there knew that voice, four counting Philip, six counting the dogs. The dogs barked and growled, Mr. Noah said 'Drop it;' and Lucy screamed, 'Oh no! oh no! it's that Pretenderette.' The parrot, with great presence of mind, flew up into the air and attacked the ear of the Pretenderette, for, as old books say, it was indeed that unprincipled character who had broken from prison and once more stolen the Hippogriff. But the Pretenderette was not to be caught twice by the same parrot. She was ready for the bird this time, and as it touched her ear she caught it in her motor veil which she must have loosened beforehand, and thrust it into a wicker cage that hung ready from the saddle of the Hippogriff who hovered on his wide white wings above the crowd of faces upturned. 'Now we shall see her face,' Lucy thought, for she could not get rid of the feeling that if she could only see the Pretenderette's face she would recognise it. But the Pretenderette was too wily to look down unveiled. She turned her face up, and she must have whispered the magic word, for the Hippogriff rose in the air and began to fly away with incredible swiftness across the sea. 'Oh, what shall I do?' cried Lucy, wringing her hands. You have often heard of people wringing their hands. Lucy, I assure you, really did wring hers. 'Oh! Mr. Noah, what will she do with him? Where will she take him? What shall I do? How can I find him again?' 'I deeply regret, my dear child,' said Mr. Noah, 'that I find myself quite unable to answer any single one of your questions.' 'But can't I go after him?' Lucy persisted. 'I am sorry to say,' said Mr. Noah, 'that we have no boats; the Pretenderette has stolen our one and only Hippogriff, and none of our camels can fly.' 'But what can I  do ?' Lucy stamped her foot in her agony of impatience. 'Nothing, my child,' Mr. Noah aggravatingly replied, 'except to go to bed and get a good night's rest. To-morrow we will return to the city and see what can be done. We must consult the oracle.' 'But can't we go  now ,' said Lucy, crying. 'No oracle is worth consulting till it's had its night's rest,' said Mr. Noah. 'It is a three days' journey. If we started now, see it is already dusk, we should arrive in the middle of the night. We will start early in the morning.' But early in the morning there was no starting from the castle of the Dwellers by the Sea. There was indeed no one to start, and there was no castle to start from. A young blugraiwee, peeping out of its hole after a rather disturbed night to see whether any human beings were yet stirring or whether it might venture out in search of yellow periwinkles, which are its favourite food, started, pricked its spotted ears, looked again, and, disdaining the cover of the rocks, walked boldly out across the beach. For the beach was deserted. There was no one there. No Mr. Noah, no Lucy, no gentle islanders, no M.A.'s, and what is more there were no huts and there was no castle. All was smooth, plain, bare sea-combed beach. For the sea had at last risen. The fear of the Dwellers had been justified. Whether the sea had been curious about the ark no one knows, no one will ever know. At any rate the sea had risen up and swept away from the beach every trace of the castle, the huts and the folk who had lived there. A bright parrot, with a streamer of motor veiling hanging to one claw, called suddenly from the clear air to the little blugraiwee. 'What's up?' the parrot asked; 'where's everything got to?' 'I don't know, I'm sure,' said the little blugraiwee; 'these human things are always coming and going. Have some periwinkles? They're very fine this morning after the storm,' it said. CHAPTER VIII UPS AND DOWNS We left Lucy in tears and Philip in the grasp of the hateful Pretenderette, who, seated on the Hippogriff, was bearing him away across the smooth blueness of the wide sea. 'Oh, Mr. Noah,' said Lucy, between sniffs and sobs, 'how  can  she! You  did  say the Hippogriff could only carry one!' 'One ordinary human being,' said Mr. Noah gently; 'you forget that dear Philip is now an earl.' 'But do you really think he's safe?' Lucy asked. 'Yes,' said Mr. Noah. 'And now, dear Lucy, no more questions. Since your arrival on our shores I have been gradually growing more accustomed to being questioned, but I still find it unpleasant and fatiguing. Desist, I entreat.' So Lucy desisted and every one went to bed, and, for crying is very tiring, to sleep. But not for long. Lucy was awakened in her bed of soft dry seaweed by the sound of the castle alarm bell, and by the blaring of trumpets and the shouting of many voices. A bright light shone in at the window of her room. She jumped up and ran to the window and leaned out. Below lay the great courtyard of the castle, a moving sea of people on which hundreds of torches seemed to float, and the sound of shouting rose in the air as foam rises in the wind. 'The Fear! The Fear!' people were shouting. 'To the ark! to the ark!' And the black night that pressed round the castle was loud with the wild roar of waves and the shriek of a tumultuous wind. Lucy ran to the door of her room. But suddenly she stopped. 'My clothes,' she said. And dressed herself hastily. For she perceived that her own petticoats and shoes were likely to have better wearing qualities than seaweed could possess, and if they were all going to take refuge in the ark, she felt she would rather have her own clothes on. 'Mr. Noah is sure to come for me,' she most sensibly told herself. 'And I'll get as many clothes on as I can.' Her own dress, of course, had been left at Polistopolis, but the ballet dress would be better than the seaweed tunic. When she was dressed she ran into Philip's room and rolled his clothes into a little bundle and carried it under her arm as she ran down the stairs. Half-way down she met Mr. Noah coming up. 'Ah! you're ready,' he said; 'it is well. Do not be alarmed, my Lucy. The tide is rising but slowly. There will be time for every one to escape. All is in train, and the embarkation of the animals is even now in progress. There has been a little delay in sorting the beasts into pairs. But we are getting on. The Lord High Islander is showing remarkable qualities. All the big animals are on board; the pigs were being coaxed on as I came up. And the ant-eaters are having a late supper. Do not be alarmed.' 'I can't help being alarmed,' said Lucy, slipping her free hand into Mr. Noah's, 'but I won't cry or be silly. Oh, I do wish Philip was here.' 'Most unreasonable of girl children,' said Mr. Noah; 'we are in danger and you wish him to be here to share it?' 'Oh, we  are  in danger, are we?' said Lucy quickly. 'I thought you said I wasn't to be alarmed.' 'No more you are,' said Mr. Noah shortly; 'of course you're in danger. But there's me. And there's the ark. What more do you want?' 'Nothing,' Lucy answered in a very small voice, and the two made their way to a raised platform overlooking the long inclined road which led up to the tower on which the ark had been built. A long procession toiled slowly up it of animals in pairs, urged and goaded by the M.A.'s under the orders of the Lord High Islander. The wild wind blew the flames of the torches out like golden streamers, and the sound of the waves was like thunder on the shore. Down below other M.A.'s were busy carrying bales tied up in seaweed. Seen from above the busy figures looked like ants when you kick into an ant-hill and the little ant people run this way and that way and every way about their little ant businesses. The Lord High Islander came in pale and serious, with all the calm competence of Napoleon at a crisis. 'Sorry to have to worry you, sir,' he said to Mr. Noah, 'but of course your experience is invaluable just now. I can't remember what bears eat. Is it hay or meat?' 'It's buns,' said Lucy. 'I beg your pardon, Mr. Noah. Of course I ought to have waited for you to say.' 'In my ark,' said Mr. Noah, 'buns were unknown and bears were fed entirely on honey, the providing of which kept our pair of bees fully employed. But if you are sure bears  like  buns we must always be humane, dear Lucy, and study the natural taste of the animals in our charge.' 'They love them,' said Lucy. 'Buns and honey,' said the Lord Islander; 'and what about bats?' 'I don't know what bats eat,' said Mr. Noah; 'I believe it was settled after some discussion that they don't eat cats. But what they  do  eat is one of the eleven mysteries. You had better let the bats fast.' 'They  are , sir,' said the Lord High Islander. 'And is all going well? Shall I come down and lend a personal eye?' 'I think I'm managing all right, sir,' said the Lord High Islander modestly. 'You see it's a great honour for me. The M.A.'s are carrying in the provisions, the boys are stowing them and also herding the beasts. They are very good workers, sir.' 'Are you frightened?' Lucy whispered, as he turned to go back to his overseeing. [Illustration: A long procession toiled slowly up it of animals in pairs.] 'Not I,' said the Lord High Islander. 'Don't you understand that I've been promoted to be Lord Vice-Noah of Polistarchia? And of course the hearts of all Vice-Noahs are strangers to fear. But just think what a difficult thing Fear would have been to be a stranger to if you and Philip hadn't got us the ark!' 'It was Philip's doing,' said Lucy; 'oh,  do  you think he's all right?' 'I think his heart is a stranger to fear, naturally,' said the Lord High Islander, 'so he's certain to be all right.' When the last of the animals had sniffed and snivelled its way into the ark, it was a porcupine with a cold in its head, the islanders, the M.A.'s, Lucy and Mr. Noah followed. And when every one was in, the door of the ark was shut from inside by an ingenious mechanical contrivance worked by a more than usually intelligent M.A. You must not suppose that the inside of the ark was anything like the inside of your own Noah's ark, where all the animals are put in anyhow, all mixed together and wrong way up as likely as not. That, with live animals and live people, would, as you will readily imagine, be quite uncomfortable. The inside of the ark which had been built under the direction of Mr. Noah and Mr. Perrin was not at all like that. It was more like the inside of a big Atlantic liner than anything else I can think of. All the animals were stowed away in suitable stalls, and there were delightful cabins for all those for whom cabins were suitable. The islanders and the M.A.'s retired to their cabins in perfect order, and Lucy and Mr. Noah, Mr. Perrin and the Lord High Islander gathered in the saloon, which was large and had walls and doors of inlaid mother-of-pearl and pink coral. It was lighted by glass globes filled with phosphorus collected by an ingenious process invented by another of the M.A.'s. 'And now,' said Mr. Noah, 'I beg that anxiety may be dismissed from every mind. If the waters subside, they leave us safe. If they rise, as I confidently expect them to do, our ark will float, and we still are safe. In the morning I will take soundings and begin to steer a course. We will select a suitable spot on the shore, land and proceed to the Hidden Places, where we will consult the oracle. A little refreshment before we retire for what is left of the night? A captain's biscuit would perhaps not be inappropriate?' He took a tin from a locker and handed it round. 'That's A1, sir,' said the Lord High Islander, munching. 'What a head you have for the right thing.' 'All practice,' said Mr. Noah modestly. 'Thank you,' said Lucy, taking a biscuit; 'I wish. . . .' The sentence was never finished. With a sickening suddenness the floor of the saloon heaved up under their feet, a roaring surging battering sound broke round them; the saloon tipped over on one side and the whole party was thrown on the pink silk cushions of the long settee. A shudder seemed to run through the ark from end to end, and 'What is it? Oh! what is it?' cried Lucy as the ark heeled over the other way and the unfortunate occupants were thrown on to the opposite set of cushions. (It really  was , now, rather like what you imagine the inside of your Noah's ark must be when you put in Mr. Noah and his family and a few hastily chosen animals and shake them all up together.) 'It's the sea,' cried the Lord High Islander; 'it's the great Fear come upon us! And I'm not afraid!' He drew himself up as well as he could in his cramped position, with Mr. Noah's elbow pinning his shoulder down and Mr. Perrin's boot on his ear. With a shake and a shiver the ark righted itself, and the floor of the saloon got flat again. 'It's all right,' said Mr. Perrin, resuming control of his boot; 'good workmanship, it do tell. She ain't shipped a drop, Mr. Noah, sir.' 'It's all right,' said Mr. Noah, taking his elbow to himself and standing up rather shakily on his yellow mat.           'We're afloat, we're afloat              On the dark rolling tide;            The ark's water-tight              And the crew are inside.           'Up, up with the flag              Let it wave o'er the sea;            We're afloat, we're afloat,               And what else should we be?' ' I  don't know,' said Lucy; 'but there isn't any flag, is there?' 'The principle's the same,' said Mr. Noah; 'but I'm afraid we didn't think of a flag.' ' I  did,' said Mr. Perrin; 'it's only a Jubilee hankey', he drew it slowly from his breast-pocket, a cotton Union Jack it was, 'but it shall wave all right. But not till daylight, I think, sir. Discretion's the better part of, don't you think, Mr. Noah, sir? Wouldn't do to open the ark out of hours, so to speak!' 'Just so,' said Mr. Noah. 'One, two, three! Bed!' The ark swayed easily on a sea not too rough. The saloon passengers staggered to their cabins. And silence reigned in the ark.                                                       I am sorry to say that the Pretenderette dropped the wicker cage containing the parrot into the sea, an unpardonable piece of cruelty and revenge; unpardonable, that is, unless you consider that she did not really know any better. The Hippogriff's white wings swept on; Philip, now laid across the knees of the Pretenderette (a most undignified attitude for any boy, and I hope none of you may be placed in such a position), screamed as the cage struck the water, and, 'Oh, Polly!' he cried. 'All right,' the parrot answered; 'keep your pecker up!' 'What did it say?' the Pretenderette asked. 'Something about peck,' said Philip upside down. 'Ah!' said the Pretenderette with satisfaction, 'he won't do any more pecking for some time to come.' And the wide Hippogriff wings swept on over the wide sea. Polly's cage fell and floated. And it floated alone till the dawn, when, with wheelings and waftings and cries, the gulls came from far and near to see what this new strange thing might be that bobbed up and down in their waters in the light of the new-born day. 'Hullo!' said Polly in bird-talk, clinging upside down to the top bars of the cage. 'Hullo, yourself,' replied the eldest gull; 'what's up? And who are you? And what are you doing in that unnatural lobster pot?' 'I conjure you,' said the parrot earnestly, 'I conjure you by our common birdhood to help me in my misfortune.' 'No gull who  is  a gull can resist that appeal,' said the master of the sea birds; 'what can we do, brother-bird?' 'The matter is urgent,' said Polly, but quite calmly. 'I am getting very wet and I dislike salt water. It is bad for my plumage. May I give an order to your followers, bird-brother?' 'Give,' said the master gull, with a graceful wheel and whirl of his splendid wings. 'Let four of my brothers raise this detested trap high above the waves,' said the parrot, 'and let others of you, with your brave strong beaks, break through the bars and set me free.' 'Delighted,' said the master gull; 'any little thing, you know,' and his own high-bred beak was the first to take hold of the cage, which presently the gulls lifted in the air and broke through, setting the parrot free. 'Thank you, brother-birds,' the parrot said, shaking wet wings and spreading them; 'one good turn deserves another. The beach yonder was white with cockles but yesterday.' 'Thank you, brother-bird,' they all said, and flew fleetly cocklewards. And that was how the parrot got free from the cage and went back to the shore to have that little talk with the blugraiwee which I told you about in the last chapter.                                                       The ark was really very pleasant by daylight with the sun shining in at its windows. The sun shone outside as well, of course, and the Union Jack waved cheerfully in the wind. Breakfast was served on the terrace at the end of the ark, you know, that terrace where the boat part turns up. It was a very nice breakfast, and the sea was quite smooth, a quite perfect sea. This was rather fortunate, for there was nothing else. Sea on every side of the ark. No land at all. 'However shall we find the way,' Lucy asked the Lord High Islander, 'with nothing but sea?' 'Oh,' he answered, 'that's all the better, really. Mr. Noah steers much better when there's no land in sight. It's all practice, you know.' 'And when we come in sight of land, will he steer badly then?' 'Oh, anybody can steer then,' said Billy; 'you if you like.' So it was Lucy who steered the ark into harbour, under Mr. Noah's directions. Arks are very easy to steer if you only know the way. Of course arks are not like other vessels; they require neither sails nor steam engines, nor oars to make them move. The very arkishness of the ark makes it move just as the steersman wishes. He only has to say 'Port,' 'Starboard,' 'Right ahead,' 'Slow' and so on, and the ark (unlike many people I know) immediately does as it is told. So steering was easy and pleasant; one just had to keep the ark's nose towards the distant domes and pinnacles of a town that shone and glittered on the shore a few miles away. And the town grew nearer and nearer, and the black streak that was the people of the town began to show white dots that were the people's faces. And then the ark was moored against a quay side, and a friendly populace cheered as Mr. Noah stepped on to firm land, to be welcomed by the governor of the town and a choice selection of eminent citizens. 'It's quite an event for them,' said Mr. Perrin. 'They don't have much happening here. A very lazy lot they be, almost as bad as Somnolentia.' 'What makes them lazy?' Lucy asked. 'It's owing to the onions and potatoes growing wild in these parts, I believe,' said the Lord High Islander. 'They get enough to eat without working. And the onions make them sleepy.' They talked apart while Mr. Noah was arranging things with the Governor of the town, who had come down to the harbour in a hurry and a flurry and a furry gown. 'I've arranged everything,' said Mr. Noah at last. 'The islanders and the M.A.'s and the animals are to be allowed to camp in the public park till we've consulted the oracle and decided what's to be done with them. They must live somewhere, I suppose. Life has become much too eventful for me lately. However there are only three more deeds for the Earl of Ark to do, and then perhaps we shall have a little peace and quietness.' 'The Earl of Ark?' Lucy repeated. 'Philip, you know. I do wish you'd try to remember that he's an earl now. Now you and I must take camel and be off.' And now came seven long days of camel travelling, through desert and forest and over hill and through valley, till at last Lucy and Mr. Noah came to the Hidden Place where the oracle is, and where that is I may not tell you, because it's one of the eleven mysteries. And I must not tell you what the oracle is because that is another of the mysteries. But I may tell you that if you want to consult the oracle you have to go a long way between rows of round pillars, rather like those in Egyptian tombs. And as you go it gets darker and darker, and when it is quite dark you see a little, little light a very long way off, and you hear very far away, a beautiful music, and you smell the scent of flowers that do not grow in any wood or field or garden of this earth. Mixed with this scent is the scent of incense and of old tapestried rooms, where no one has lived for a very long time. And you remember all the sad and beautiful things you have ever seen or heard, and you fall down on the ground and hide your face in your hands and call on the oracle, and if you are the right sort of person the oracle answers you. Lucy and Mr. Noah waited in the dark for the voice of the oracle, and at last it spoke. Lucy heard no words, only the most beautiful voice in the world speaking softly, and so sweetly and finely and bravely that at once she felt herself brave enough to dare any danger, and strong enough to do any deed that might be needed to get Philip out of the clutches of the base Pretenderette. All the tiredness of her long journey faded away, and but for the thought that Philip needed her, she would have been content to listen for ever to that golden voice. Everything else in the world faded away and grew to seem worthless and unmeaning. Only the soft golden voice remained and the grey hard voice that said, 'You've got to look after Philip, you know!' And the two voices together made a harmony more beautiful than you will find in any of Beethoven's sonatas. Because Lucy knew that she should follow the grey voice, and remember the golden voice as long as she lived. But something was tiresomely pulling at her sleeve, dragging her away from the wonderful golden voice. Mr. Noah was pulling her sleeve and saying, 'Come away,' and they turned their backs on the little light and the music and the enchanting perfumes, and instantly the voice stopped and they were walking between dusky pillars towards a far grey speck of sunlight. It was not till they were once more under the bare sky that Lucy said: 'What did it say?' 'You must have heard,' said Mr. Noah. 'I only heard the voice and what it meant. I didn't understand the words. But the voice was like dreams and everything beautiful I've ever thought of.' 'I thought it a wonderfully straight-forward business-like oracle,' said Mr. Noah briskly; 'and the voice was quite distinct and I remember every word it said.' (Which just shows how differently the same thing may strike two people.) 'What did it say?' Lucy asked, trotting along beside him, still clutching Philip's bundle, which through all these days she had never let go. And Mr. Noah gravely recited the following lines. I agree with him that, for an oracle, they were extremely straightforward.           'You had better embark            Once again in the Ark,            And sailing from dryland            Make straight for the Island.' 'Did it  really  say that?' Lucy asked. 'Of course it did,' said Mr. Noah; 'that's a special instruction to me, but I daresay you heard something quite different. The oracle doesn't say the same thing to every one, of course. Didn't you get any special instruction?' 'Only to try to be brave and good,' said Lucy shyly. 'Well, then,' said Mr. Noah, 'you carry out your instructions and I'll carry out mine.' 'But what's the use of going to the island if you can't land when you get there?' Lucy insisted. 'You know only two people can land there, and we're not them, are we?' 'Oh, if you begin asking what's the use, we shan't get anywhere,' said Mr. Noah. 'And more than half the things you say are questions.'                                                       I'm sorry this chapter is cut up into bits with lines of stars, but stars are difficult to avoid when you have to tell about a lot of different things happening all at once. That is why it is much better always to keep your party together if you can. And I have allowed mine to get separated so that Philip, the parrot and the rest of the company are going through three sets of adventures all at the same time. This is most trying for me, and fully accounts for the stars. Which I hope you'll excuse. However. We now come back by way of the stars to Philip wrong way up in the clutches of the Pretenderette. She had breathed the magic word in the Hippogriff's ear, but she had not added any special order. So the Hippogriff was entirely its own master as far as the choice of where it was to go was concerned. It tossed its white mane after circling three times between air and sky, made straight for the Island-where-you-mayn't-go. The Pretenderette didn't know that it was the Island-where-you-mayn't-go, and as they got nearer and she could see plainly its rainbow-coloured sands, its palms and its waterfalls, its cool green thickets and many tinted flowers and glowing fruits, it seemed to her that she might do worse than land there and rest for a little while. For even the most disagreeable people get tired sometimes, and the Pretenderette had had a hard day of it. So she made no attempt to check the Hippogriff or alter its course. And when the Hippogriff was hovering but a few inches from the grass of the most beautiful of the island glades, she jerked Philip roughly off her knee and he fell all in a heap on the ground. With great presence of mind our hero, if he isn't a hero by now he never will be, picked himself up and bolted into the bushes. No rabbit could have bolted more instantly and fleetly. 'I'll teach you,' said the furious Pretenderette, preparing to alight. She looked down to find a soft place to jump on. And then she saw that every blade of grass was a tiny spear of steel, and every spear was pointed at her. She made the Hippogriff take her to another glade, more little steel spears. To the rainbow sands, but on looking at them she saw that they were quivering quicksands. Wherever green grass had grown the spears now grew; and wherever the sand was it was a terrible trap of quicksand. She tried to dismount in a little pool, but fortunately for her she noticed in time that what shone in it so silvery was not water but white-hot molten metal. 'What a nasty place,' said the Pretenderette; 'I don't know that I could have chosen a nastier place to leave that naughty child in. He'll know who's master by the time I send to fetch him back to prison. Here, you, get back to Polistopolis as fast as you can. See? Please, I mean,' she added, and then she spoke the magic word. Philip was peeping through the bushes close by, and he heard that magic word (I dare not tell you what it is) and he saw for the first time the face of the Pretenderette. And he trembled and shivered in his bushy lurking-place. For the Pretenderette was the only really unpleasant person Philip had ever met in the world. It was Lucy's nurse, the nurse with the grey dress and the big fat feet, who had been so cross to him and had pulled down his city. 'How on earth,' Philip wondered to himself, 'did she get  here ? And how on earth shall I get away from her?' He had not seen the spears and the quicksands and the molten metal, and he was waiting unhappily for her to alight, and for a game of hide and seek to begin, which he was not at all anxious to play. Even as he wondered, the Hippogriff spread wings and flew away. And Philip was left alone on the island. But what did that matter? It was much better to be alone than with that Pretenderette. And for Philip there were no white-hot metal and spears and snares of quicksand, only dewy grass and sweet flowers and trees and safety and delight. 'If only Lucy were here,' he said. When he was quite sure that the Pretenderette was really gone, he came out and explored the island. It had on it every kind of flower and fruit that you can think of, all growing together. There were gold oranges and white orange flowers, pink apple-blossom and red apples, cherries and cherry-blossom, strawberry flowers and strawberries, all growing together, wild and sweet. At the back of his mind Philip remembered that he had, at some time or other, heard of an island where fruit and blossoms grew together at the same time, but that was all he could remember. He passed through the lovely orchards and came to a lake. It was frozen. And he remembered that, in the island he had heard of, there was a lake ready for skating even when the flowers and fruit were on the trees. Then he came to a little summer-house built all of porcupine quills like Helen's pen-box. And then he knew. All these wonders were on the island that he and Helen had invented long ago, the island that she used to draw maps of. 'It's our very own island,' he said, and a glorious feeling of being at home glowed through him, warm and delightful. 'We said no one else might come here! That's why the Pretenderette couldn't land. And why they call it the Island-where-you-mayn't-go. I'll find the bun tree and have something to eat, and then I'll go to the boat-house and get out the  Lightning Loose  and go back for Lucy. I do wish I could bring her here. But of course I can't without asking Helen.' The  Lightning Loose  was the magic yacht Helen had invented for the island. He soon found a bush whose fruit was buns, and a jam-tart tree grew near it. You have no idea how nice jam tarts can taste till you have gathered them yourself, fresh and sticky, from the tree. They are as sticky as horse-chestnut buds, and much nicer to eat. As he went towards the boat-house he grew happier and happier, recognising, one after the other, all the places he and Helen had planned and marked on the map. He passed by the marble and gold house with  King's Palace  painted on the door. He longed to explore it: but the thought of Lucy drove him on. As he went down a narrow leafy woodland path towards the boat-house, he passed the door of the dear little thatched cottage (labelled  Queen's Palace ) which was the house Helen had insisted that she liked best for her very own. 'How pretty it is; I wish Helen was here,' he said; 'she helped to make it. I should never have thought of it without her. She ought to be here,' he said. With that he felt very lonely, all of a sudden, and very sad. And as he went on, wondering whether in all this magic world there might not somehow be some magic strong enough to bring Helen there to see the island that was their very own, and to give her consent to his bringing Lucy to it, he turned a corner in the woodland path, and walked straight into the arms of, Helen. [Illustration: Walked straight into the arms of Helen.] CHAPTER IX ON THE 'LIGHTNING LOOSE' 'But how did you get here?' said Philip in Helen's arms on the island. 'I just walked out at the other side of a dream,' she said; 'how could I not come, when the door was open and you wanted me so?' And Philip just said, 'Oh, Helen!' He could not find any other words, but Helen understood. She always did. 'Come,' she said, 'shall we go to your Palace or mine? I want my supper, and we'll have our own little blue-and-white tea-set. Yes, I know you've had your supper, but it'll be fun getting mine, and perhaps you'll be hungry again before we've got it.' They went to the thatched cottage that was Helen's palace, because Philip had had almost as much of large buildings as he wanted for a little while. The cottage had a wide chimney and an open hearth; and they sat on the hearth and made toast, and Philip almost forgot that he had ever had any adventures and that the toast was being made on a hearth whose blue wood-smoke curled up among the enchanting tree-tops of a magic island. And before they went to bed he had told her all about everything. 'Oh, I am so glad you came!' he said over and over again; 'it is so easy to tell you  here , with all the magic going on. I don't think I ever  could  have told you at the Grange with the servants all about, and the, I mean Mr. Graham, and all the things as not magic as they could possibly be. Oh, Helen! where  is  Mr. Graham; won't he hate your coming away from him?' 'He's gone through a dream door too,' she said, 'to see Lucy. Only he doesn't know he's really gone. He'll think it's a dream, and he'll tell me about it when we both wake up.' 'When did you go to sleep?' said Philip. 'At Brussels. That telegram hasn't come yet.' 'I don't understand about time,' said Philip firmly, 'and I never shall. I say, Helen, I was just looking for the  Lightning Loose , to go off in her on a voyage of discovery and find Lucy.' 'I don't think you need,' she said; 'I met a parrot on the island just before I met you and it was saying poetry to itself.' 'It would be,' said Philip, 'if it was alive. I'm glad it  is  alive, though. What was it saying?' 'It was something like this,' she said, putting a log of wood on the fire:           'Philip and Helen            Have the island to dwell in,                                Hooray.            They said of the island,            'It's your land and my land!'                  Hooray. Hooray. Hooray.           'And till the ark            Comes out of the dark            There those two may stay            For a happy while, and            Enjoy their island            Until the Giving Day.                              Hooray.           'And then they will hear the giving voice,            They will hear and obey,            And when people come            Who need a home,            They'll give the island away.                                  Hooray.           'The island with flower            And fruit and bower,            Forest and river and bay,            Their very own island            They'll sigh and smile and            They'll give their island away.' 'What nonsense!' said Philip, 'I never will.' 'All right, my Pipkin,' said Helen cheerfully; 'I only told you just to show that you're expected to stay here. 'Philip and Helen have the island to dwell in.' And now, what about bed?' They spent a whole week on the island. It was exactly all that they could wish an island to be; because, of course, they had made it themselves, and of course they knew exactly what they wanted. I can't describe that week. I only know that Philip will never forget it. Just think of all the things you could do on a magic island if you were there with your dearest dear, and you'll know how Philip spent his time. He enjoyed every minute of every hour of every day, and, best thing of all, that week made him understand, as nothing else could have done, that Helen still belonged to him, and that her marriage to Mr. Graham had not made her any the less Philip's very own Helen. And then came a day when Philip, swinging in a magnolia tree, looked out to sea and cried out, 'A sail! a sail! Oh, Helen, here's the ark! Now it's all over. Let's have Lucy to stay with us, and send the other people away,' he added, sliding down the tree-trunk with his face very serious. 'But we can't, dear,' Helen reminded him. 'The island's ours, you know; and as long as it's ours no one else can land on it. We made it like that, you know.' 'Then they can't land?' 'No,' said Helen. 'Can't we change the rule and let them land?' 'No,' said Helen. 'Oh, it  is  a pity,' Philip said; 'because the island is the place for islanders, isn't it?' 'Yes,' said Helen, 'and there's no fear of the sea here; you remember we made it like that when we made the island?' 'Yes,' said Philip. 'Oh, Helen, I  don't  want to.' 'Then don't,' said Helen. 'Ah, but I  do  want to, too.' 'Then do,' said she. 'But don't you see, when you want to and don't want to at the same time, what  are  you to do? There are so many things to think of.' 'When it's like that, there's one thing you mustn't think of,' she said. 'What?' Philip asked. 'Yourself,' she said softly. There was a silence, and then Philip suddenly hugged his sister and she hugged him. 'I'll give it to them,' he said; 'it's no use. I know I ought to. I shall only be uncomfortable if I don't.' Helen laughed. 'My boy of boys!' she said. And then she looked sad. 'Boy of my heart,' she said, 'you know it's not only giving up our island. If we give it away I must go. It's the only place that there's a door into out of my dreams.' 'I can't let you go,' he said. 'But you've got your deeds to do,' she said, 'and I can't help you in those. Lucy can help you, but I can't. You like Lucy now, don't you?' 'Oh, I don't mind her,' said Philip; 'but it's  you  I want, Helen.' 'Don't think about that,' she urged. 'Think what the islanders want. Think what it'll be to them to have the island, to live here always, safe from the fear!' 'There are three more deeds,' said Philip dismally; 'I don't think I shall ever want any more adventures as long as I live.' 'You'll always want them,' she said, laughing at him gently, 'always. And now let's do the thing handsomely and give them a splendid welcome. Give me a kiss and then we'll gather heaps of roses.' So they kissed each other. But Philip was very unhappy indeed, though he felt that he was being rather noble and that Helen thought so too, which was naturally a great comfort. There had been a good deal more of this talk than I have set down. Philip and Helen had hardly had time to hang garlands of pink roses along the quayside where the  Lightning Loose , that perfect yacht, lay at anchor, before the blunt prow of the ark bumped heavily against the quayside, and the two, dropping the rest of the roses, waved and smiled to the group on the ark's terrace. The first person to speak was Mr. Perrin, who shouted, 'Here we are again!' like a clown. Then Lucy said, 'We know we can't land, but the oracle said come and we came.' She leaned over the bulwark to whisper, 'Who's that perfect duck you've got with you?' Philip answered aloud: 'This is my sister Helen, Helen this is Lucy.' The two looked at each other, and then Helen held out her hands and she and Lucy kissed each other. 'I knew I should like you,' Lucy whispered, 'but I didn't know I should like you quite so much.' Mr. Noah and Mr. Perrin were both bowing to Helen, a little stiffly but very cordially all the same, and quite surprisingly without surprise. And the Lord High Islander was looking at her with his own friendly jolly schoolboy grin. 'If you will embark,' said Mr. Noah politely, 'we can return to the mainland, and I will explain to you your remaining deeds.' 'Tell them, Pip,' said Helen. 'We don't want to embark, at present,' said Philip shyly. 'We want you to land.' 'No one may land on the island save two,' said Mr. Noah. 'I am glad you are the two. I feared one of the two might be the Pretenderette.' 'Not much,' said Philip. 'It's Helen's and mine. We made it. And we want to give it to the islanders to keep. For their very own,' he added, feeling that it would be difficult for any one to believe that such a glorious present was really being made just like that, without speeches, as if it had been a little present of a pencil sharpener or a peg-top. He was right. 'To keep?' said the Lord High Islander; 'for our very own? Always?' 'Yes,' said Philip. 'And there's no fear here. You'll  really  be 'happy troops' now.' For a moment nobody said anything, though all the faces were expressive. Then the Lord High Islander spoke. 'Well,' he said, 'of all the brickish bricks, , ' and could say no more. 'There are lots of houses,' said Philip, 'and room for all the animals, and the island is thirty miles round, so there's lots of room for the animals and everything.' He felt happier than he had ever done in his life. Giving presents is always enjoyable, and this was such a big and beautiful present, and he loved it so. 'I always did say Master Pip was a gentleman, and I always shall,' Mr. Perrin remarked. 'I congratulate you,' said Mr. Noah, 'and I am happy to announce that your fifth deed is now accomplished. You remember our empty silver fruit-dishes? Your fifth deed was to be the supplying of Polistarchia with fruit. This island is the only place in the kingdom where fruit grows. The ark will serve to convey the fruit to the mainland, and the performance of this deed raises you to the rank of Duke.' 'Philip, you're a dear,' said Lucy in a whisper. 'Shut up,' said Philip fiercely. 'Three cheers,' said a familiar voice, 'for the Duke of Donors.' 'Three cheers,' repeated the Lord High Islander, 'for the Duke of Donors.' What a cheer! All the islanders cheered and the M.A.'s and Lucy and Mr. Perrin and Mr. Noah, and from the inside of the ark came enthusiastic barkings and gruntings and roarings and squeakings, as the animals of course joined in as well as they could. Thousands of gulls, circling on white wings in the sun above, added their screams to the general chorus. And when the sound of the last cheer died away, a little near familiar voice said: 'Well done, Philip! I'm proud of you.' It was the parrot who, perched on the rigging of the  Lightning Loose , had started the cheering. 'So that's all right,' it said, fluttered on to Philip's shoulder and added, 'I've heard you calling for me on the island all the week. But I felt I needed a rest. I've been talking too much. And that Pretenderette. And that cage. I assure you I needed a little time to get over my adventures.' 'We have all had our adventures,' said Mr. Noah gently. And Helen said: 'Won't you land and take possession of the island? I'm sure we are longing to hear each other's adventures.' 'You first,' said Mr. Noah to the Lord High Islander, who stepped ashore very gravely. When Helen saw him come forward, she suddenly kissed Philip, and as the Lord High Islander's foot touched the shore of that enchanted island, she simply and suddenly vanished. 'Oh!' cried Philip, 'I wish I hadn't.' And his mouth trembled as girls' mouths do if they are going to cry. 'The more a present costs you, the more it's worth,' said Mr. Noah. 'This has cost you so much, it's the most splendid present in the world.' 'I know,' said Philip; 'make yourselves at home, won't you?' he just managed to say. And then he found he could not say any more. He just turned and went into the forest. And when he was alone in a green glade, he flung himself down on his face and lay a long time without moving. It had been such a happy week. And he was so tired of adventures. When at last he sniffed with an air of finality and raised his head, the first thing he saw was Lucy, sitting quite still with her back to him. 'Hullo!' he said rather crossly, 'what are you doing here?' 'Saying the multiplication table,' said Lucy promptly and turned her head, 'so as not even to think about you. And I haven't even once turned round. I knew you wanted to be alone. But I wanted to be here when you'd done being alone. See? I've got something to say to you.' 'Fire ahead,' said Philip, still grumpy. 'I think you're perfectly splendid,' said Lucy very seriously, 'and I want it to be real pax for ever. And I'll help you in the rest of the adventures. And if you're cross, I'll try not to mind. Napoleon was cross sometimes, I believe,' she added pensively, 'and Julius Caesar.' 'Oh, that's all right,' said Philip very awkwardly. 'Then we're going to be real chums?' 'Oh yes, if you like. Only, I don't mind just this once; and it was decent of you to come and sit there with your back to me, only I hate gas.' 'Yes,' said Lucy obediently, 'I know. Only sometimes you feel you must gas a little or burst of admiration. And I've got your proper clothes in a bundle. I've been carrying them about ever since the islanders' castle was washed away. Here they are.' She produced the bundle. And this time Philip was really touched. 'Now I  do  call that something like,' he said. 'The seaweed dress is all right here, but you never know what you may have to go through when you're doing adventures. There might be thorns or snakes or anything. I'm jolly glad to get my boots back too. I say, come on. Let's go to Helen's palace and get a banquet ready. I know there'll have to be a banquet. There always is, here. I know a first-rate bun-tree quite near here.' 'The cocoa-nut-ice plants looked beautiful as I came along,' said Lucy. 'What a lovely island it is. And you made it!' 'No gas,' said Philip warningly. 'Helen and I made it.' 'She's the dearest darling,' said Lucy. 'Oh, well,' said Philip with resignation, 'if you must gas, gas about her.' The banquet was all that you can imagine of interesting and magnificent. And Philip was, of course, the hero of the hour. And when the banquet was finished and the last guest had departed to its own house, for the houses on the island were of course all ready to be occupied, furnished to the last point of comfort, with pin-cushions full of pins in every room, Mr. Noah and Lucy and Philip sat down on the terrace steps among the pink roses for a last little talk. 'Because,' said Philip, 'we shall start the first thing in the morning. So please will you tell me now what the next deed is that I have to do?' 'Will you go by ark?' Mr. Noah asked, rolling up his yellow mat to make an elbow rest and leaning on it; 'I shall be delighted.' 'I thought,' said Philip, 'we might go in the  Lightning Loose . I've never sailed her yet, you know. Do you think I  could ?' 'Of course you can,' said Mr. Noah; 'and if not, Lucy can show you. Your charming yacht is steered on precisely the same principle as the ark. And in this land all the winds are favourable. You will find the yacht suitably provisioned. And I may add that you can go most of the way to your next deed by water, first the sea and then the river.' 'And what,' asked Philip, 'is the next deed?' 'In the extreme north of Polistarchia,' said Mr. Noah instructively, 'lies a town called Somnolentia. It used to be called Briskford in happier days. A river then ran through the town, a rapid river that brought much gold from the mountains. The people used to work very hard to keep the channel clear of the lumps of gold which continually threatened to choke it. Their fields were then well-watered and fruitful, and the inhabitants were cheerful and happy. But when the Hippogriff was let out of the book, a Great Sloth got out too. Evading all efforts to secure him, the Great Sloth journeyed northward. He is a very large and striking animal, and by some means, either fear or admiration, he obtained a complete ascendancy over the inhabitants of Briskford. He induced them to build him a temple of solid gold, and while they were doing this the river bed became choked up and the stream was diverted into another channel far from the town. Since then the place is fallen into decay. The fields are parched and untilled. Such water as the people need for drinking is drawn by great labour from a well. Washing has become shockingly infrequent.' 'Are we to teach the dirty chaps to wash?' asked Philip in disgust. 'Do not interrupt,' said Mr. Noah. 'You destroy the thread of my narrative. Where was I?' 'Washing infrequent,' said Lucy; 'but if the fields are dried up, what do they live on?' 'Pine-apples,' replied Mr. Noah, 'which grow freely and do not need much water. Gathering these is the sole industry of this degraded people. Pine-apples are not considered a fruit but a vegetable,' he added hastily, seeing another question trembling on Philip's lips. 'Whatever of their waking time can be spared from the gathering and eating of the pine-apples is spent in singing choric songs in honour of the Great Sloth. And even this time is short, for such is his influence on the Somnolentians that when he sleeps they sleep too, and,' added Mr. Noah impressively, 'he sleeps almost all the time. Your deed is to devise some means of keeping the Great Sloth awake and busy. And I think you've got your work cut out. When you've disposed of the Great Sloth you can report yourself to me here. I shall remain here for some little time. I need a holiday. The parrot will accompany you. It knows its way about as well as any bird in the land. Good-night. And good luck! You will excuse my not being down to breakfast.' And the next morning, dewy-early, Philip and Lucy and the parrot went aboard the yacht and loosed her from her moorings, and Lucy showed Philip how to steer, and the parrot sat on the mast and called out instructions. They made for the mouth of a river. ('I never built a river,' said Philip. 'No,' said the parrot, 'it came out of the poetry book.') And when they were hungry they let down the anchor and went into the cabin for breakfast. And two people sprang to meet them, almost knocking Lucy down with the violence of their welcome. The two people were Max and Brenda. [Illustration: He induced them to build him a temple of solid gold.] 'Oh, you dear dogs,' Lucy cried, and Philip patted them, one with each hand, 'how did you get here?' 'It was a little surprise of Mr. Noah's,' said the parrot. Max and Brenda whined and barked and gushed. 'I wish we could understand what they're saying,' said Lucy. 'If you only knew the magic word that the Hippogriff obeys,' said the parrot, 'you could say it, and then you'd understand all animal talk. Only, of course, I mustn't tell it you. It's one of the eleven mysteries.' 'But I know it,' said Philip, and at once breathed the word in the tiny silky ear of Brenda and then in the longer silkier ear of Max, and instantly,  'Oh, my dears!' they heard Brenda say in a softly shrill excited voice; 'oh, my dearie dears! We  are  so pleased to see you. I'm only a poor little faithful doggy; I'm not clever, you know, but my affectionate nature makes me almost mad with joy to see my dear master and mistress again.' 'Very glad to see you, sir,' said Max with heavy politeness. 'I hope you'll be comfortable here. There's no comfort for a dog like being with his master.' And with that he sat down and went to sleep, and the others had breakfast. It is rather fun cooking in yachts. And there was something new and charming in Brenda's delicate way of sitting up and begging and saying at the same time, 'I do  hate  to bother my darling master and mistress, but if you  could  spare another  tiny  bit of bacon, Oh,  thank you , how good and generous you are!' They sailed the yacht successfully into the river which presently ran into the shadow of a tropical forest. Also out of a book. 'You might go on during the night,' said the parrot, 'if the dogs would steer under my directions. You could tie one end of a rope to their collars and another to the helm. It's easier than turning spits.' 'Delighted!' said Max; 'only, of course, it's understood that we sleep through the day?' 'Of course,' said everybody. So that was settled. And the children went to bed. It was in the middle of the night that the parrot roused Philip with his usual gentle beak-touch. Then,  'Wake up,' it said; 'this is not the right river. It's not the right direction. Nothing's right. The ship's all wrong. I'm very much afraid some one has been opening a book and this river has got out.' Philip hurried out on deck, and by the light of the lamps from the cabin, gazed out at the banks of the river. At least he looked for them. But there weren't any banks. Instead, steep and rugged cliffs rose on each side, and overhead, instead of a starry sky, was a great arched roof of a cavern glistening with moisture and dark as a raven's feathers. 'We must turn back,' said Philip. 'I don't like this at all.' 'Unfortunately,' said the parrot, 'there is no room to turn back, and the  Lightning Loose  is not constructed for going backwards.' 'Oh, dear,' whispered Brenda, 'I wish we hadn't come. Dear little dogs ought to be taken comfortable care of and not be sent out on nasty ships that can't turn back when it's dangerous.' 'My dear,' said Max with slow firmness, 'dear little dogs can't help themselves now. So they had better look out for chances of helping their masters.' 'But what can we  do , then?' said Philip impatiently. 'I fear,' said the parrot, 'that we can do nothing but go straight on. If this river is in a book it will come out somewhere. No river in a book ever runs underground and stays there.' 'I shan't wake Lucy,' said Philip; 'she might be frightened.' 'You needn't,' said Lucy, 'she's awake, and she's no more frightened than you are.' ('You hear that,' said Max to Brenda; 'you take example by her, my dear!') 'But if we are going the wrong way, we shan't reach the Great Sloth,' Lucy went on. 'Sooner or later, one way or another, we shall come to him,' said the parrot; 'and time is of no importance to a Great Sloth.' It was now very cold, and our travellers were glad to wrap themselves in the flags of all nations with which the yacht was handsomely provided. Philip made a sort of tabard of the Union Jack and the old Royal Arms of England, with the lilies and leopards; and Lucy wore the Japanese flag as a shawl. She said the picture of the sun on it made her feel warm. But Philip shivered under his complicated crosses and lions, as the  Lightning Loose  swept on over the dark tide between the dark walls and under the dark roof of the cavern. 'Cheer up,' said the parrot. 'Think what a lot of adventures you're having that no one else has ever had: think what a lot of things you'll have to tell the other boys when you go to school.' 'The other boys wouldn't believe a word of it,' said Philip in gloom. 'I wouldn't unless I knew it was true.' 'What I think is,' said Lucy, watching the yellow light from the lamps rushing ahead along the roof, 'that we shan't want to tell people. It'll be just enough to know it ourselves and talk about it, just Philip and me together.' 'Well, as to that, , ' the parrot was beginning doubtfully, when he broke off to exclaim: 'Do my claws deceive me or is there a curious vibration, and noticeable acceleration of velocity?' 'Eh?' said Philip, which is not manners, and he knew it. 'He means,' said Max stolidly, 'aren't we going rather fast and rather wobbly?' We certainly were. The  Lightning Loose  was going faster and faster along that subterranean channel, and every now and then gave a lurch and a shiver. 'Oh!' whined Brenda; 'this is a dreadful place for dear little dogs!' 'Philip!' said Lucy in a low voice, 'I know something is going to happen. Something dreadful. We  are  friends, aren't we?' 'Yes,' said Philip firmly. 'Then I wish you'd kiss me.' 'I can like you just as much without that,' said Philip uneasily. 'Kissing people, it's silly, don't you think?' 'Nobody's kissed me since daddy went away,' she said, 'except Helen. And you don't mind kissing Helen. She  said  you were going to adopt me for your sister.' 'Oh! all right,' said Philip, and put his arm round her and kissed her. She felt so little and helpless and bony in his arm that he suddenly felt sorry for her, kissed her again more kindly and then, withdrawing his arm, thumped her hearteningly on the back. 'Be a man,' he said in tones of comradeship and encouragement. 'I'm perfectly certain nothing's going to happen. We're just going through a tunnel, and presently we shall just come out into the open air again, with the sky and the stars going on as usual.' He spoke this standing on the prow beside Lucy, and as he spoke she clutched his arm. 'Oh, look,' she breathed, 'oh, listen!' He listened. And he heard a dull echoing roar that got louder and louder. And he looked. The light of the lamps shone ahead on the dark gleaming water, and then quite suddenly it did not shine on the water because there was no longer any water for it to shine on. Only great empty black darkness. A great hole, ahead, into which the stream poured itself. And now they were at the edge of the gulf. The  Lightning Loose  gave a shudder and a bound and hung for what seemed a long moment on the edge of the precipice down which the underground river was pouring itself in a smooth sleek stream, rather like poured treacle, over what felt like the edge of everything solid. [Illustration: Plunged headlong over the edge.] The moment ended, and the little yacht, with Philip and Lucy and the parrot and the two dogs, plunged headlong over the edge into the dark unknown abyss below. 'It's all right, Lu,' said Philip in that moment. 'I'll take care of you.' And then there was silence in the cavern, only the rushing sound of the great waterfall echoed in the rocky arch. CHAPTER X THE GREAT SLOTH You have heard of Indians shooting rapids in their birch-bark canoes? And perhaps you have yourself sailed a toy boat on a stream, and made a dam of clay, and waited with more or less patience till the water rose nearly to the top, and then broken a bit of your dam out and made a waterfall and let your boat drift over the edge of it. You know how it goes slowly at first, then hesitates and sweeps on more and more quickly. Sometimes it upsets; and sometimes it shudders and strains and trembles and sways to one side and to the other, and at last rights itself and makes up its mind, and rushes on down the stream, usually to be entangled in the clump of rushes at the stream's next turn. This is what happened to that good yacht, the  Lightning Loose . She shot over the edge of that dark smooth subterranean waterfall, hung a long breathless moment between still air and falling water, slid down like a flash, dashed into the stream below, shuddered, reeled, righted herself and sped on. You have perhaps been down the water chute at Earl's Court? It was rather like that. 'It's, it's all right,' said Philip, in a rather shaky whisper. 'She's going on all right.' 'Yes,' said Lucy, holding his arm very tight; 'yes, I'm sure she's going on all right.' 'Are we drowned?' said a trembling squeak. 'Oh, Max, are we really drowned?' 'I don't think so,' Max replied with caution. 'And if we are, my dear, we cannot undrown ourselves by screams.' 'Far from it,' said the parrot, who had for the moment been rendered quite speechless by the shock. And you know a parrot is not made speechless just by any little thing. 'So we may just as well try to behave,' it said. The lamps had certainly behaved, and behaved beautifully; through the wild air of the fall, the wild splash as the  Lightning Loose  struck the stream below, the lamps had shone on, seemingly undisturbed. 'An example to us all,' said the parrot. 'Yes, but,' said Lucy, 'what are we to do?' 'When adventures take a turn one is far from expecting, one does what one can,' said the parrot. 'And what's that?' 'Nothing,' said the parrot. 'Philip has relieved Max at the helm and is steering a straight course between the banks, if you can call them banks. There is nothing else to be done.' There plainly wasn't. The  Lightning Loose  rushed on through the darkness. Lucy reflected for a moment and then made cocoa. This was real heroism. It cheered every one up, including the cocoa-maker herself. It was impossible to believe that anything dreadful was going to happen when you were making that soft, sweet, ordinary drink. 'I say,' Philip remarked when she carried a cup to him at the wheel, 'I've been thinking. All this is out of a book. Some one must have let it out. I know what book it's out of too. And if the whole story got out of the book we're all right. Only we shall go on for ages and climb out at last, three days' journey from Trieste.' 'I see,' said Lucy, and added that she hated geography. 'Drink your cocoa while it's hot,' she said in motherly accents, and 'what book is it?' 'It's  The Last Cruise of the Teal ,' he said. 'Helen gave it me just before she went away. It's a ripping book, and I used it for the roof of the outer court of the Hall of Justice. I remember it perfectly. The chaps on the  Teal  made torches of paper soaked in paraffin.' 'We haven't any,' said Lucy; 'besides our lamps light everything up all right. Oh! there's Brenda crying again. She hasn't a shadow of pluck.' She went quickly to the cabin where Max was trying to cheer Brenda by remarks full of solid good sense, to which Brenda paid no attention whatever. 'I knew how it would be,' she kept saying in a whining voice; 'I told you so from the beginning. I wish we hadn't come. I want to go home. Oh! what a dreadful thing to happen to dear little dogs.' 'Brenda,' said Lucy firmly, 'if you don't stop whining you shan't have any cocoa.' Brenda stopped at once and wagged her tail appealingly. 'Cocoa?' she said, 'did any one say cocoa? My nerves are so delicate. I know I'm a trial, dear Max, it's no use your pretending I'm not, but there is nothing like cocoa for the nerves. Plenty of sugar, please, dear Lucy. Thank you  so  much! Yes, it's  just  as I like it.' 'There will be other things to eat by and by,' said Lucy. 'People who whine won't get any.' 'I'm sure nobody would  dream  of whining,' said Brenda. 'I know I'm too sensitive; but you can do anything with dear little dogs by kindness. And as for whining, do you know it's a thing I've never been subject to, from a child, never. Max will tell you the same.' Max said nothing, but only fixed his beautiful eyes hopefully on the cocoa jug. And all the time the yacht was speeding along the underground stream, beneath the vast arch of the underground cavern. 'The worst of it is we may be going ever so far away from where we want to get to,' said Philip, when Max had undertaken the steering again. 'All roads,' remarked the parrot, 'lead to Somnolentia. And besides the ship is travelling due north, at least so the ship's compass states, and I have no reason as yet for doubting its word.' 'Hullo!' cried more than one voice, and the ship shot out of the dark cavern into a sheet of water that lay spread under a white dome. The stream that had brought them there seemed to run across one side of this pool. Max, directed by the parrot, steered the ship into smooth water, where she lay at rest at last in the very middle of this great underground lake. ' This  isn't out of  The Cruise of the Teal ,' said Philip. 'They must have shut that book.' 'I think it's out of a book about Mexico or Peru or Ingots or some geographical place,' said Lucy; 'it had a green-and-gold binding. I think you used it for the other end of the outer justice court. And if you did, this dome's solid silver, and there's a hole in it, and under this dome there's untold treasure in gold incas.' 'What's incas?' 'Gold bars, I believe,' said Lucy; 'and Mexicans come down through the hole in the roof and get it, and when enemies come they flood it with water. It's flooded now,' she added unnecessarily. 'I wish adventures had never been invented,' said Brenda. 'No, dear Lucy, I am not whining. Far from it. But if a dear little dog might suggest it, we should all be better in a home, should we not?' All eyes now perceived a dark hole in the roof, a round hole exactly in the middle of the shining dome. And as they gazed the dark hole became light. And they saw above them a white shining disk like a very large and very bright moon. It was the light of day. 'Some one has opened the trap-door,' said Lucy. 'The Ingots always closed their treasure-vaults with trap-doors.' The bright disk was obscured; confused shapes broke its shining roundness. Then another disk, small and very black appeared in the middle of it; the black disk grew larger and larger and larger. It was coming down to them. Slowly and steadily it came; now it reached the level of the dome, now it hung below it; down, down, down it came, past the level of their eager eyes and splashed in the water close by the ship. It was a large empty bucket. The rope which held it was jerked from above; the bucket dipped and filled and was drawn up again slowly and steadily till it disappeared in the hole in the roof. 'Quick,' said the parrot, 'get the ship exactly under the hole, and next time the bucket comes down you can go up in it.' 'This is out of the  Arabian Nights , I think,' said Lucy, when the yacht was directly under the hole in the roof. 'But who is it that keeps on opening the books? Somebody must be pulling Polistopolis down.' 'The Pretenderette, I shouldn't wonder,' said Philip gloomily. 'She isn't the Deliverer, so she must be the Destroyer. Nobody else can get into Polistarchia, you know.' 'There's me.' 'Oh, you're Deliverer too.' 'Thank you,' said Lucy gratefully. 'But there's Helen.' 'She was only on the Island, you know; she couldn't come to Polistarchia. Look out!' The bucket was descending again, and instead of splashing in the water it bumped on the deck. 'You go first,' said Philip to Lucy. 'And you,' said Max to Brenda. 'Oh, I'll go first if you like,' said Philip. 'Yes,' said Max, 'I'll go first if you like, Brenda.' You see Philip felt that he ought to give Lucy the first chance of escaping from the poor  Lightning Loose . Yet he could not be at all sure what it was that she would be escaping to. And if there was danger overhead, of course he ought to be the one to go first to face it. And the worthy Max felt the same about Brenda. And Lucy felt just the same as they did. I don't know what Brenda felt. She whined a little. Then for one moment Lucy and Philip stood on the deck each grasping the handle of the bucket and looking at each other, and the dogs looked at them, and the parrot looked at every one in turn. An impatient jerk and shake of the rope from above reminded them that there was no time to lose. Lucy decided that it was more dangerous to go than to stay, just at the same moment when Philip decided that it was more dangerous to stay than to go, so when Lucy stepped into the bucket Philip helped her eagerly. Max thought the same as Philip, and I am afraid Brenda agreed with them. At any rate she leaped into Lucy's lap and curled her long length round just as the rope tightened and the bucket began to go up. Brenda screamed faintly, but her scream was stifled at once. 'I'll send the bucket down again the moment I get up,' Lucy called out; and a moment later, 'it feels awfully jolly, like a swing.' And so saying she was drawn up into the hole in the roof of the dome. Then a sound of voices came down the shaft, a confused sound; the anxious little party on the  Lightning Loose  could not make out any distinct words. They all stood staring up, expecting, waiting for the bucket to come down again. 'I hate leaving the ship,' said Philip. 'You shall be the last to leave her,' said the parrot consolingly; 'that is if we can manage about Max without your having to sit on him in the bucket if he gets in first.' 'But how about you?' said Philip. [Illustration: The bucket began to go up.] A little arrogantly the parrot unfolded half a bright wing. 'Oh!' said Philip enlightened and reminded. 'Of course! And you might have flown away at any time. And yet you stuck to us. I say, you know, that was jolly decent of you.' 'Not at all,' said the parrot with conscious modesty. 'But it was,' Philip insisted. 'You might have, ,  hullo!' cried Philip. The bucket came down again with a horrible rush. They held their breaths and looked to see the form of Lucy hurtling through the air. But no, the bucket swung loose a moment in mid-air, then it was hastily drawn up, and a hollow metallic clang echoed through the cavern. 'Brenda!' the cry was wrung from the heart of the sober self-contained Max. 'My wings and claws!' exclaimed the parrot. 'Oh, bother!' said Philip. There was some excuse for these expressions of emotion. The white disk overhead had suddenly disappeared. Some one up above had banged the lid down. And all the manly hearts were below in the cave, and brave Lucy and helpless Brenda were above in a strange place, whose dangers those below could only imagine. 'I wish  I'd  gone,' said Philip. 'Oh, I  wish  I'd gone.' 'Yes, indeed,' said Max, with a deep sigh. 'I feel a little faint,' said the parrot; 'if some one would make a cup of cocoa.' Thus did the excellent bird seek to occupy their minds in that first moment of disaster. And it was well that the captain and crew were thus saved from despair. For before the kettle boiled, the lid of the shaft opened about a foot and something largeish, roundish and lumpish fell heavily and bounced upon the deck of the  Lightning Loose . It was a pine-apple, fresh, ripe and juicy. On its side was carved in large letters of uncertain shape the one word 'WAIT.' It was good advice and they took it. Really I do not see what else they could have done in any case. And they ate the pine-apple. And presently every one felt extremely sleepy. 'Waiting is one of those things that you can do as well asleep as awake, or even better,' said the parrot. 'Forty winks will do us all the good in the world.' He put his head under his wing where he sat on the binnacle. 'May I turn in alongside you, sir?' Max asked. 'I shan't feel the dreadful loneliness so much then.' So Philip and Max curled up together on the deck, warmly covered with the spare flags of all nations, and the forty winks lasted for the space of a good night's rest, about ten hours, in fact. So ten hours' waiting was got through quite easily. But there was more waiting to do after they woke up, and that was not so easy.       .       .       .       .       .       .       . When Lucy, sitting in the bucket with Brenda in her lap, felt the bucket lifted from the deck and swung loose in the air, it was as much as she could do to refrain from screaming. Brenda  did  scream, as you know, but Lucy stifled the sound in the folds of her frock. Lucy bit her lips, made a great effort and called out that remark about the bucket-swing, just as though she were quite comfortable. It was very brave of her and helped her to go on being brave. The bucket drew slowly up and up and up and passed from the silver dome into the dark shaft above. Lucy looked up. Yes, it was daylight that showed at the top of the shaft, and the rope was drawing her up towards it. Suppose the rope broke? Brenda was quite quiet now. She said afterwards that she must have fainted. And now the light was nearer and nearer. Now Lucy was in it, for the bucket had been drawn right up, and hands were reached out to draw it over the side of what seemed like a well. At that moment Lucy saw in a flash what might happen if the owners of the hands, in their surprise, let go the bucket and the windlass. She caught Brenda in her hands and threw the dog out on to the dry ground, and threw herself across the well parapet. Just in time, for a shout of surprise went up and the bucket went down, clanging against the well sides. The hands  had  let go. Lucy clambered over the well side slowly, and when her feet stood on firm ground she saw that the hands were winding up the bucket again, and that it came very easily. 'Oh, don't!' she said. 'Let it go right down! There are some more people down there.' 'Sorry, but it's against the rules. The bucket only goes down this well forty times a day. And that was the fortieth time.' They pulled the bucket in and banged down the lid of the well. Some one padlocked it and put the key in his pocket. And Lucy and he stood facing each other. He was a little round-headed man in a curious stiff red tunic, and there was something about the general shape of him and his tunic which reminded Lucy of something, only she could not remember what. Behind him stood two others, also red-tunicked and round-headed. [Illustration: Lucy threw herself across the well parapet.] Brenda crouched at Lucy's feet and whined softly, and Lucy waited for the strangers to speak. 'You shouldn't do that,' said the red-tunicked man at last, 'it was a great shock to us, your bobbing up as you did. It will keep us awake at night, just remembering it.' 'I'm sorry,' said Lucy. 'You should always come into strange towns by the front gate,' said the man; 'try to remember that, will you? Good-night.' 'But you're not going off like this,' said Lucy. 'Let me write a note and drop it down to the others. Have you a bit of pencil, and paper?' 'No,' said the strange people, staring at her. 'Haven't you anything I can write on?' Lucy asked them. 'There's nothing here but pine-apples,' said one of them at last. So she cut a pine-apple from among the hundreds that grew among the rocks near by, and carved 'WAIT' on it with her penknife. 'Now,' she said, 'open that well lid.' 'It's as much as our lives are worth,' said the leader. 'No it isn't,' said Lucy; 'there's no law against dropping pine-apples into the well. You know there isn't. It isn't like drawing water. And if you don't I shall set my little dog at you. She is very fierce.' Brenda was so flattered that she showed her teeth and growled. 'Oh, very well,' said the stranger; 'anything to avoid fuss.' When the well lid was padlocked down again, Lucy said: 'What country is this?' though she was almost sure, because of the pine-apples, that it was Somnolentia. And when they had said that word she said: 'Now I'll tell you something. The Deliverer is coming up that well next time you draw water. He is coming to deliver you from the bondage of the Great Sloth.' 'It is true,' said the red round-headed leader, 'that we are in bondage. And the Great Sloth wearies us with the singing of choric songs when we long to be asleep. But none can deliver us. There is no hope. There is nothing good but sleep. And of that we have never enough.' 'Oh, dear,' said Lucy despairingly, 'aren't there any women here? They always have more sense than men.' 'What you say is rude as well as untrue,' said the red leader; 'but to avoid fuss we will lead you and your fierce dog to the huts of the women. And then perhaps you will allow us to go to sleep.' The huts were poor and mean, little fenced-in corners in the ruins of what had once been a great and beautiful city, with gardens and streams; but now the streams were dry and nothing grew in the gardens but weeds and pine-apples. But the women, who all wore green tunics of the same stiff shape as the men's, were not quite so sleepy as their husbands. They brought Lucy fresh pine-apples to eat, and were dreamily interested in the cut of her clothes and the begging accomplishments of Brenda. And from the women she learned several things about the Somnolentians. They all wore the same shaped tunics, only the colours differed. The women's were green, the drawers of water wore red, the attendants of the Great Sloth wore black, and the pine-apple gatherers wore yellow. And as Lucy sat at the door of the hut and watched the people in these four colours going lazily about among the ruins she suddenly knew what they were, and she exclaimed: 'I know what you are; you're Halma men.' Instantly every man within earshot made haste to get away, and the women whispered, 'Hush! It is death to breathe that name.' 'But why?' Lucy asked. 'Halma was the great captain of our race,' said the woman, 'and the Great Sloth fears that if we hear his name it will rouse us and we shall break from bondage and become once more a free people.' Lucy determined that they should hear that name pretty often; but before she could speak it again the woman sighed, and remarking 'The Great Sloth sleeps,' fell asleep then and there over the pine-apple she was peeling. A vast silence settled on the city, and next moment Lucy also slept. She slept for hours.       .       .       .       .       .       .       . It took her some time to find the keeper of the padlock key, and when she had found him he refused to use it. Nothing would move him, not even the threat of the fierceness of Brenda. At last, almost in despair, Lucy suddenly remembered a word of power. 'I command you to open the well and let down the bucket,' she said. 'I command you by the great name of Halma.' 'It is death to speak that name,' said the keeper of the key, looking over his shoulder anxiously. 'It is life to speak that name,' said Lucy. 'Halma! Halma! Halma! If you don't open that well I'll carve the name on a pine-apple and send it in on the golden tray with the Great Sloth's dinner.' 'It would have the lives of hundreds for that,' said the keeper in horror. 'Open the well then,' said Lucy.       .       .       .       .       .       .       . They all held a council as soon as Philip and Max had been safely drawn up in the bucket, and Lucy told them all she knew. 'I think whatever we do we ought to be quick,' said Lucy; 'that Great Sloth is dangerous. I'm sure it is. It's sent already to say I am to be brought to its presence to sing songs to it while it goes to sleep. It doesn't mind me because it knows I'm not the Deliverer. And if you'll let me, I believe I can work everything all right. But if it knows you're here, it'll be much harder.' The degraded Halma men were watching them from a distance, in whispering groups. 'I shall go and sing to the Great Sloth,' she said, 'and you must go about and say the name of power to every one you meet, and tell them you're the Deliverer. Then if my idea doesn't come off, we must overpower the Great Sloth by numbers and . . . . You just go about saying 'Halma!', see?' 'While you do the dangerous part? Likely!' said Philip. 'It's not dangerous. It never hurts the people who sing, never,' said Lucy. 'Now I'm going.' And she went before Philip could stop her. 'Let her go,' said the parrot; 'she is a wise child.' The temple of the Great Sloth was built of solid gold. It had beautiful pillars and doorways and windows and courts, one inside the other, each paved with gold flagstones. And in the very middle of everything was a large room which was entirely feather-bed. There the Great Sloth passed its useless life in eating, sleeping and listening to music. Outside the moorish arch that led to this inner room Lucy stopped and began to sing. She had a clear little voice and she sang 'Jockey to the Fair,' and 'Early one morning,' and then she stopped. And a great sleepy slobbery voice came out from the room and said: 'Your songs are in very bad taste. Do you know no sleepy songs?' 'Your people sing you sleepy songs,' said Lucy. 'What a pity they can't sing to you all the time.' 'You have a sympathetic nature,' said the Great Sloth, and it came out and leaned on the pillar of its door and looked at her with sleepy interest. It was enormous, as big as a young elephant, and it walked on its hind legs like a gorilla. It was very black indeed. 'It  is  a pity,' it said; 'but they say they cannot live without drinking, so they waste their time in drawing water from the wells.' 'Wouldn't it be nice,' said Lucy, 'if you had a machine for drawing water. Then they could sing to you all day, if they chose.' 'If  I  chose,' said the Great Sloth, yawning like a hippopotamus. 'I am sleepy. Go!' 'No,' said Lucy, and it was so long since the Great Sloth had heard that word that the shock of the sound almost killed its sleepiness. ' What  did you say?' it asked, as if it could not believe its large ears. 'I said 'No,'' said Lucy. 'I mean that you are so great and grand you have only to wish for anything and you get it.' 'Is that so?' said the Great Sloth dreamily and like an American. 'Yes,' said Lucy with firmness. 'You just say, 'I wish I had a machine to draw up water for eight hours a day.' That's the proper length for a working day. Father says so.' 'Say it all again, and slower,' said the creature. 'I didn't quite catch what you said.' Lucy repeated the words. 'If that's all. . . .' said the Great Sloth; 'now say it again, very slowly indeed.' Lucy did so and the Great Sloth repeated after her: 'I wish I had a machine to draw up water for eight hours a day.' 'Don't,' it said angrily, looking back over its shoulder into the feather-bedded room, 'don't, I say. Where are you shoving to? Who are you? What are you doing in my room? Come out of it.' Something did come out of the room, pushing the Great Sloth away from the door. And what came out was the vast feather-bed in enormous rolls and swellings and bulges. It was being pushed out by something so big and strong that it was stronger that the Great Sloth itself, and pushed that mountain of lazy sloth-flesh half across its own inner courtyard. Lucy retreated before its advancing bulk and its extreme rage. 'Push me out of my own feather-bedroom, would it?' said the Sloth, now hardly sleepy at all. 'You wait till I get hold of it, whatever it is.' The whole of the feather-bed was out in the courtyard now, and the Great Sloth climbed slowly back over it into its room to find out who had dared to outrage its Slothful Majesty. Lucy waited, breathless with hope and fear, as the Great Sloth blundered back into the inner room of its temple. It did not come out again. There was a silence, and then a creaking sound and the voice of the Great Sloth saying: 'No, no, no, I won't. Let go, I tell you.' Then more sounds of creaking and the sound of metal on metal. She crept to the arch and peeped round it. The room that had been full of feather-bed was now full of wheels and cogs and bands and screws and bars. It was full, in fact, of a large and complicated machine. And the handle of that machine was being turned by the Great Sloth itself. 'Let me go,' said the Great Sloth, gnashing its great teeth. 'I won't work!' 'You must,' said a purring voice from the heart of the machinery. 'You wished for me, and now you have to work me eight hours a day. It is the law'; it was the machine itself which spoke. 'I'll break you,' said the Sloth. 'I am unbreakable,' said the machine with gentle pride. 'This is your doing,' said the Sloth, turning its furious eyes on Lucy in the doorway. 'You wait till I catch you!' And all the while it had to go on turning that handle. 'Thank you,' said Lucy politely; 'I think I will not wait. And I shall have eight hours' start,' she added. Even as she spoke a stream of clear water began to run from the pumping machine. It slid down the gold steps and across the golden court. Lucy ran out into the ruined square of the city shouting: 'Halma! Halma! Halma! To me, Halma's men!' And the men, already excited by Philip, who had gone about saying that name of power without a moment's pause all the time Lucy had been in the golden temple, gathered round her in a crowd. 'Quick!' she said; 'the Great Sloth is pumping water up for you. He will pump for eight hours a day. Quick! dig a channel for the water to run in. The Deliverer,' she pointed to Philip, 'has given you back your river.' Some ran to look out old rusty half-forgotten spades and picks. But others hesitated and said: 'The Great Sloth will work for eight hours, and then it will be free to work vengeance on us.' 'I will go back,' said Lucy, 'and explain to it that if it does not behave nicely you will all wish for machine guns, and it knows now that if people wish for machinery they have to use it. It will be awake now for eight hours and if you all work for eight hours a day you'll soon have your city as fine as ever. And there's one new law. Every time the clock strikes you must all say 'Halma!' aloud, every one of you, to remind yourselves of your great destiny, and that you are no longer slaves of the Great Sloth.' [Illustration: And all the while it had to go on turning that handle.] She went back and explained machine guns very carefully to the now hard-working Sloth. When she came back all the men were at work digging a channel for the new river. The women and children crowded round Lucy and Philip. 'Ah!' said the oldest woman of all, 'now we shall be able to wash in water. I've heard my grandmother say water was very pleasant to wash in. I never thought I should live to wash in water myself.' 'Why?' Lucy asked. 'What do you wash in?' 'Pine-apple juice,' said a dozen voices, 'when we  do  wash!' 'But that must be very sticky,' said Lucy. 'It is,' said the oldest woman of all; 'very!' CHAPTER XI THE NIGHT ATTACK The Halma men were not naturally lazy. They were, in the days before the coming of the Great Sloth, a most energetic and industrious people. Now that the Sloth was obliged to work eight hours a day, the weight of its constant and catching sleepiness was taken away, and the people set to work in good earnest. (I did explain, didn't I, that the Great Sloth's sleepiness really was catching, like measles?) So now the Halma men were as busy as ants. Some dug the channel for the new stream, some set to work to restore the buildings, while others weeded the overgrown gardens and ploughed the deserted fields. The head Halma man painted in large letters on a column in the market-place these words: 'This city is now called by its ancient name of Briskford. Any citizen found calling it Somnolentia will not be allowed to wash in water for a week.' The head-man was full of schemes, the least of which was the lighting of the town by electricity, the power to be supplied by the Great Sloth. 'He can't go on pumping eight hours a day,' said the head-man; 'I can easily adjust the machine to all sorts of other uses.' In the evening a banquet was (of course) given to the Deliverers. The banquet was all pine-apple and water, because there had been no time to make or get anything else. But the speeches were very flattering; and Philip and Lucy were very pleased, more so than Brenda, who did not like pine-apple and made but little effort to conceal her disappointment. Max accepted bits of pine-apple, out of politeness, and hid them among the feet of the guests so that nobody's feelings should be hurt. 'I don't know how we're to get back to the island,' said Philip next day, 'now we've lost the  Lightning Loose .' 'I think we'd better go back by way of Polistopolis,' said Lucy, 'and find out who's been opening the books. If they go on they may let simply anything out. And if the worst comes to the worst, perhaps we could get some one to help us to open the  Teal  book again and get the  Teal  out to cross to the island in.' 'Lu,' said Philip with feeling, 'you're clever, really clever. No, I'm not kidding. I mean it. And I'm sorry I ever said you were only a girl. But how are we to get to Polistopolis?' It was a difficult problem. The head-man could offer no suggestions. It was Brenda who suggested asking the advice of the Great Sloth. 'He is such a fine figure of an animal,' she said admiringly; 'so handsome and distinguished-looking. I am sure he must have a really great mind. I always think good looks go with really great minds, don't you, dear Lucy?' 'We might as well,' said Philip, 'if no one can think of anything else.' No one could. So they decided to take Brenda's advice. Now that the Sloth worked every day it was not nearly so disagreeable as it had been when it slept so much. The children approached it at the dinner hour and it listened patiently if drowsily to their question. When it had quite done, it reflected, or seemed to reflect; perhaps it had fallen asleep, until the town clock struck one, the time for resuming work. Then it got up and slouched towards its machine. 'Cucumbers,' it said, and began to turn the handle of its wheel. They had to wait till tea-time to ask it what it meant, for in that town the rule about not speaking to the man at the wheel was strictly enforced. 'Cucumbers,' the Sloth repeated, and added a careful explanation. 'You sit on the end of any young cucumber which points in the desired direction, and when it has grown to its full length, say sixteen inches, why, then you are sixteen inches on your way.' 'But that's not much,' said Lucy. 'Every little helps,' said the Sloth; 'more haste less speed. Then you wait till the cucumber seeds, and, when the new plants grow, you select the earliest cucumber that points in the desired direction and take your seat on it. By the end of the cucumber season you will be another sixteen, or with luck seventeen, inches on your way. Thirty-two inches in all, almost a yard. And thus you progress towards your goal, slowly but surely, like in politics.' 'Thank you very much,' said Philip; 'we will think it over.' But it did not need much thought. 'If we could get a motor car!' said Philip. 'If you can get machines by wishing for them. . . .' 'The very thing,' said Lucy, 'let's find the head-man.  We  mustn't wish for a motor or we should have to go on using it. But perhaps there's some one here who'd like to drive a motor, for his living, you know?' There was. A Halma man, with an inborn taste for machinery, had long pined to leave the gathering of pine-apples to others. He was induced to wish for a motor and a B.S.A. sixty horse-power car snorted suddenly in the place where a moment before no car was. 'Oh, the luxury! This is indeed like home,' sighed Brenda, curling up on the air-cushions. And the children certainly felt a gloriously restful sensation. Nothing to be done; no need to think or bother. Just to sit quiet and be borne swiftly on through wonderful cities, all of which Philip vaguely remembered to have seen, small and near, and built by his own hands and Helen's. And so, at last, they came close to Polistopolis. Philip never could tell how it was that he stopped the car outside the city. It must have been some quite unaccountable instinct, because naturally, you know, when you are not used to being driven in motors, you like to dash up to the house you are going to, and enjoy your friends' enjoyment of the grand way in which you have travelled. But Philip felt, in that quite certain and quite unexplainable way in which you do feel things sometimes, that it was best to stop the car among the suburban groves of southernwood, and to creep into the town in the disguise afforded by motor coats, motor veils and motor goggles. (For of course all these had come with the motor car when it was wished for, because no motor car is complete without them.) [Illustration: Philip felt that it was best to stop the car among the suburban groves of southernwood.] They said good-bye warmly to the Halma motor man, and went quietly towards the town, Max and Brenda keeping to heel in the most praiseworthy way, and the parrot nestling inside Philip's jacket, for it was chilled by the long rush through the evening air. And now the scattered houses and spacious gardens gave place to the streets of Polistopolis, the capital of the kingdom. And the streets were strangely deserted. The children both felt, in that quite certain and unexplainable way, that it would be unwise of them to go to the place where they had slept the last time they were in that city. The whole party was very tired. Max walked with drooping tail, and Brenda was whining softly to herself from sheer weariness and weak-mindedness. The parrot alone was happy, or at least contented. Because it was asleep. At the corner of a little square planted with southernwood-trees in tubs, Philip called a halt. 'Where shall we go?' he said; 'let us put it to the vote.' And even as he spoke, he saw a dark form creeping along in the shadow of the houses. 'Who goes there?' Philip cried with proper spirit, and the answer surprised him, all the more that it was given with a kind of desperate bravado. 'I go here; I, Plumbeus, Captain of the old Guard of Polistopolis.' 'Oh, it's you!' cried Philip; 'I  am  glad. You can advise us. Where can we go to sleep? Somehow or other I don't care to go to the house where we stayed before.' The captain made no answer. He simply caught at the hands of Lucy and Philip, dragged them through a low arched doorway and, as soon as the long lengths of Brenda and Max had slipped through, closed the door. 'Safe,' he said in a breathless way, which made Philip feel that safety was the last thing one could count on at that moment. 'Now, speak low, who knows what spies may be listening? I am a plain man. I speak as I think. You came out of the unknown. You may be the Deliverer or the Destroyer. But I am a judge of faces, always was from a boy, and I cannot believe that this countenance of apple-cheeked innocence is that of a Destroyer.' Philip was angry and Lucy was furious. So he said nothing. And she said: 'Apple-cheeked yourself!' which was very rude. 'I see that you are annoyed,' said the captain in the dark, where, of course, he could see nothing; 'but in calling your friend apple-cheeked I was merely offering the highest compliment in my power. The absence of fruit in this city is, I suppose, the reason why our compliments are like that. I believe poets say 'sweet as a rose',  we  say 'sweet as an orange.' May I be allowed unreservedly to apologise?' 'Oh, that's all right,' said Philip awkwardly. 'And to ask whether you  are  the Deliverer?' 'I hope so,' said Philip modestly. 'Of course he is,' said the parrot, putting its head out from the front of Philip's jacket; 'and he has done six deeds out of the seven already.' 'It is time that deeds were done here,' said the captain. 'I'll make a light and get you some supper. I'm in hiding here; but the walls are thick and all the shutters are shut.' He bolted a door and opened the slide of a dark lantern. 'Some of us have taken refuge in the old prison,' he said; 'it's never used, you know, so her spies don't infest it as they do every other part of the city.' 'Whose spies?' 'The Destroyer's,' said the captain, getting bread and milk out of a cupboard; 'at least, if you're the Deliverer she must be that. But she says she's the Deliverer.' He lighted candles and set them on the table as Lucy asked eagerly: 'What Destroyer? Is it a horrid woman in a motor veil?' 'You've guessed it,' said the captain gloomily. 'It's that Pretenderette,' said Philip. 'Does Mr. Noah know? What has she been doing?' 'Everything you can think of,' said the captain; 'she says she's Queen, and that she's done the seven deeds. And Mr. Noah doesn't know, because she's set a guard round the city, and no message can get out or in.' 'The Hippogriff?' said Lucy. 'Yes, of course I thought of that,' said the captain. 'And so did she. She's locked it up and thrown the key into one of the municipal wells.' 'But why do the guards obey her?' Philip asked. 'They're not  our  guards, of course,' the captain answered. 'They're strange soldiers that she got out of a book. She got the people to pull down the Hall of Justice by pretending there was fruit in the gigantic books it's built with. And when the book was opened these soldiers came marching out. The Sequani and the Aedui they call themselves. And when you've finished supper we ought to hold a council. There are a lot of us here. All sorts. Distinctions of rank are forgotten in times of public peril.' Some twenty or thirty people presently gathered in that round room from whose windows Philip and Lucy had looked out when they were first imprisoned. There were indeed all sorts, match-servants, domino-men, soldiers, china-men, Mr. Noah's three sons and his wife, a pirate and a couple of sailors. 'What book,' Philip asked Lucy in an undertone, 'did she get these soldiers out of?' 'Caesar, I think,' said Lucy. 'And I'm afraid it was my fault. I remember telling her about the barbarians and the legions and things after father had told me, when she was my nurse, you know. She's very clever at thinking of horrid things to do, isn't she?' The council talked for two hours, and nobody said anything worth mentioning. When every one was quite tired out, every one went to bed. It was Philip who woke in the night in the grasp of a sudden idea. 'What is it?' asked Max, rousing himself from his warm bed at Philip's feet. 'I've thought of something,' said Philip in a low excited voice. 'I'm going to have a night attack.' 'Shall I wake the others?' asked Max, ever ready to oblige. Philip thought a moment. Then: 'No,' he said, 'it's rather dangerous; and besides I want to do it all by myself. Lucy's done more than her share already. Look out, Max; I'm going to get up and go out.' He got up and he went out. There was a faint greyness of dawn now which showed him the great square of the city on which he and Lucy had looked from the prison window, a very long time ago as it seemed. He found without difficulty the ruins of the Hall of Justice. And among the vast blocks scattered on the ground was one that seemed of grey marble, and bore on its back in gigantic letters of gold the words  De Bello Gallico . Philip stole back to the prison and roused the captain. 'I want twenty picked men,' he said, 'without boots, and at once.' He got them, and he led them to the ruins of the Justice Hall. 'Now,' he said, 'raise the cover of this book; only the cover, not any of the pages.' The men set their shoulders to the marble slab that was the book's cover and heaved it up. And as it rose on their shoulders Philip spoke softly, urgently. 'Caesar,' he said, 'Caesar!' And a voice answered from under the marble slab. 'Who calls?' it said. 'Who calls upon Julius Caesar?' And from the space below the slab, as it were from a marble tomb, a thin figure stepped out, clothed in toga and cloak and wearing on its head a crown of bays. ' I  called,' said Philip in a voice that trembled a little. 'There's no one but you who can help. The barbarians of Gaul hold this city. I call on great Caesar to drive them away. No one else can help us.' Caesar stood for a moment silent in the grey twilight. Then he spoke. 'I will do it,' he said; 'you have often tried to master Caesar and always failed. Now you shall be no more ashamed of that failure, for you shall see Caesar's power. Bid your slaves raise the leaves of my book to the number of fifteen.' It was done, and Caesar turned towards the enormous open book. 'Come forth!' he said. 'Come forth, my legions!' Then something in the book moved suddenly, and out of it, as out of an open marble tomb, came long lines of silent armed men, ranged themselves in ranks, and, passing Caesar, saluted. And still more came, and more and more, each with the round shield and the shining helmet and the javelins and the terrible short sword. And on their backs were the packages they used to carry with them into war. 'The Barbarians of Gaul are loose in this city,' said the voice of the great commander; 'drive them before you once more as you drove them of old.' 'Whither, O Caesar?' asked one of the Roman generals. 'Drive them, O Titus Labienus,' said Caesar, 'back into that book wherein I set them more than nineteen hundred years ago, and from which they have dared to escape. Who is their leader?' he asked of Philip. 'The Pretenderette,' said Philip; 'a woman in a motor veil.' 'Caesar does not war with women,' said the man in the laurel crown; 'let her be taken prisoner and brought before me.' Low-voiced, the generals of Caesar's army gave their commands, and with incredible quietness the army moved away, spreading itself out in all directions. 'She has caged the Hippogriff,' said Philip; 'the winged horse, and we want to send him with a message.' 'See that the beast is freed,' said Caesar, and turned to Plumbeus the captain. 'We be soldiers together,' he said. 'Lead me to the main gate. It is there that the fight will be fiercest.' He laid a hand on the captain's shoulder, and at the head of the last legion, Caesar and the captain of the soldiers marched to the main gate. CHAPTER XII THE END Philip tore back to the prison, to be met at the door by Lucy. 'I hate you,' she said briefly, and Philip understood. 'I couldn't help it,' he said; 'I did want to do something by myself.' And Lucy understood. 'And besides,' he said, 'I was coming back for you. Don't be snarky about it, Lu. I've called up Caesar himself. And you shall see him before he goes back into the book. Come on; if we're sharp we can hide in the ruins of the Justice Hall and see everything. I noticed there was a bit of the gallery left standing. Come on. I want you to think what message to send by the Hippogriff to Mr. Noah.' 'Oh, you needn't trouble about that,' said Lucy in an off-hand manner. 'I sent the parrot off  ages  ago.' 'And you never told me! Then I think that's quits; don't you?' Lucy had a short struggle with herself (you know those unpleasant and difficult struggles, I am sure!) and said: 'Right-o!' And together they ran back to the Justice Hall. The light was growing every moment, and there was now a sound of movement in the city. Women came down to the public fountains to draw water, and boys swept the paths and doorsteps. That sort of work goes on even when barbarians are surrounding a town. And the ordinary sounds of a town's awakening came to Lucy and Philip as they waited; crowing cocks and barking dogs and cats mewing faintly for the morning milk. But it was not for those sounds that Lucy and Philip were waiting. So through those homely and familiar sounds they listened, listened, listened; and very gradually, so that they could neither of them have said at any moment 'Now it has begun,' yet quite beyond mistake the sound for which they listened was presently loud in their ears. And it was the sound of steel on steel; the sound of men shouting in the breathless moment between sword-stroke and sword-stroke; the cry of victory and the wail of defeat. And, presently, the sound of feet that ran. And now a man shot out from a side street and ran across the square towards the Palace of Justice where Lucy and Philip were hidden in the gallery. And now another and another all running hard and making for the ruined hall as hunted creatures make for cover. Rough, big, blond, their long hair flying behind them, and their tunics of beast-skins flapping as they ran, the barbarians fled before the legions of Caesar. The great marble-covered book that looked like a marble tomb was still open, its cover and fifteen leaves propped up against the tall broken columns of the gateway of the Justice Hall. Into that open book leapt the first barbarian, leapt and vanished, and the next after him and the next, and then, by twos and threes and sixes and sevens, they leapt in and disappeared, amid gasping and shouting and the nearing sound of the bucina and of the trumpets of Rome. Then from all quarters of the city the Roman soldiers came trooping, and as the last of the barbarians plunged headlong into the open book, the Romans formed into ordered lines and waited, while a man might count ten. Then, advancing between their ranks, came the spare form and thin face of the man with the laurel crown. [Illustration: They leapt in and disappeared.] Twelve thousand swords flashed in air and wavered a little like reeds in the breeze, then steadied themselves, and the shout went up from twelve thousand throats: 'Ave Caesar!' And without haste and without delay the Romans filed through the ruins to the marble-covered book, and two by two entered it and disappeared. Each as he passed the mighty conqueror saluted him with proud mute reverence. When the last soldier was hidden in the book, Caesar looked round him, a little wistfully. 'I must speak to him; I must,' Lucy cried; 'I  must . Oh, what a darling he is!' She ran down the steps from the gallery and straight to Caesar. He smiled when she reached him, and gently pinched her ear. Fancy going through the rest of your life hearing all the voices of the world through an ear that has been pinched by Caesar! 'Oh, thank you! thank you!' said Philip; 'how splendid you are. I'll swot up my Latin like anything next term, so as to read about you.' 'Are they all in?' Lucy asked. 'I do hope nobody was hurt.' Caesar smiled. 'A most unreasonable wish, my child, after a great battle!' he said. 'But for once the unreasonable is the inevitable. Nobody was hurt. You see it was necessary to get every man back into the book just as he left it, or what would the schoolmasters have done? There remain now only my own guard who have in charge the false woman who let loose the barbarians. And here they come.' Surrounded by a guard with drawn swords the Pretenderette advanced slowly. 'Hail, woman!' said Caesar. 'Hail, whoever you are!' said the Pretenderette very sulkily. 'I hail,' said Caesar, 'your courage.' Philip and Lucy looked at each other. Yes, the Pretenderette had courage: they had not thought of that before. All the attempts she had made against them, she alone in a strange land, yes, these needed courage. 'And I demand to know how you came here?' 'When I found he'd been at his building again,' she said, pointing a contemptuous thumb at Philip, 'I was just going to pull it down, and I knocked down a brick or two with my sleeve, and not thinking what I was doing I built them up again; and then I got a bit giddy and the whole thing seemed to begin to grow, candlesticks and bricks and dominoes and everything, bigger and bigger and bigger, and I looked in. It was as big as a church by this time, and I saw that boy losing his way among the candlestick pillars, and I followed him and I listened. And I thought I could be as good a Deliverer as anybody else. And the motor veil that I was going to catch the 2.37 train in was a fine disguise.' 'You tried to injure the children,' Caesar reminded her. 'I don't want to say anything to make you let me off,' said the Pretenderette, 'but at the beginning I didn't think any of it was real. I thought it was a dream. You can let your evil passions go in a dream and it don't hurt any one.' 'It hurts you,' Caesar said. 'Oh! that's no odds,' said the Pretenderette scornfully. 'You sought to injure and confound the children at every turn,' said Caesar, 'even when you found that things were real.' 'I saw there was a chance of being Queen,' said the Pretenderette, 'and I took it. Seems to me you've no occasion to talk if you're Julius Caesar, the same as the bust in the library. You took what you could get right enough in your time, when all's said and done.' 'I hail,' said Caesar again, 'your courage.' 'You needn't trouble,' she said, tossing her head; 'my game's up now, and I'll speak my mind if I die for it. You don't understand. You've never been a servant, to see other people get all the fat and you all the bones. What you think it's like to know if you'd just been born in a gentleman's mansion instead of in a model workman's dwelling you'd have been brought up as a young lady and had the openwork silk stockings and the lace on your under-petticoats.' 'You go too deep for me,' said Caesar, with the ghost of a smile. 'I now pronounce your sentence. But life has pronounced on you a sentence worse than any I can give you. Nobody loves you.' 'Oh, you old silly,' said the Pretenderette in a burst of angry tears, 'don't you see that's just why everything's happened?' 'You are condemned,' said Caesar calmly, 'to make yourself beloved. You will be taken to Briskford, where you will teach the Great Sloth to like his work and keep him awake for eight play-hours a day. In the intervals of your toil you must try to get fond of some one. The Halma people are kind and gentle. You will not find them hard to love. And when the Great Sloth loves his work and the Halma people are so fond of you that they feel they cannot bear to lose you, your penance will be over and you can go where you will.' 'You know well enough,' said the Pretenderette, still tearful and furious, 'that if that ever happened I shouldn't want to go anywhere else.' 'Yes,' said Caesar slowly, 'I know.' Lucy would have liked to kiss the Pretenderette and say she was sorry, but you can't do that when it is all other people's fault and  they  aren't sorry. And besides, before all these people, it would have looked like showing off. You know, I am sure, exactly how Lucy felt. The Pretenderette was led away. And now Caesar stood facing the children, his hands held out in farewell. The growing light of early morning transfigured his face, and to Philip it suddenly seemed to be most remarkably like the face of That Man, Mr. Peter Graham, whom Helen had married. He was just telling himself not to be a duffer when Lucy cried out in a loud cracked-sounding voice, 'Daddy, oh, Daddy!' and sprang forward. And at that moment the sun rose above the city wall, and its rays gleamed redly on the helmet and the breastplate and the shield and the sword of Caesar. The light struck at the children's eyes like a blow. Dazzled, they closed their eyes and when they opened them, blinking and confused, Caesar was gone and the marble book was closed, for ever.       .       .       .       .       .       .       . Three days later Mr. Noah arrived by elephant, and the meeting between him and the children is, as they say, better imagined than described. Especially as there is not much time left now for describing anything. Mr. Noah explained that the freeing of Polistopolis from the Pretenderette and the barbarians counted as the seventh deed and that Philip had now attained the rank of King, the deed of the Great Sloth having given him the title of Prince of Pine-apples. His expression of gratitude and admiration were of the warmest, and Philip felt that it was rather ungrateful of him to say, as he couldn't help saying: 'Now I've done all the deeds, mayn't I go back to Helen?' 'All in good time,' said Mr. Noah; 'I will at once set about the arrangements for your coronation.' The coronation was an occasion of unexampled splendour. There was a banquet (of course) and fireworks, and all the guns fired salutes and the soldiers presented arms, and the ladies presented bouquets. And at the end Mr. Noah, with a few well-chosen words which brought tears to all eyes, placed the gold crown of Polistarchia upon the brow of Philip, where its diamonds and rubies shone dazzlingly. There was an extra crown for Lucy, made of silver and pearls and pale silvery moonstones. You have no idea how the Polistarchians shouted. 'And now,' said Mr. Noah when it was all over, 'I regret to inform you that we must part. Polistarchia is a Republic, and of course in a republic kings and queens are not permitted to exist. Partings are painful things. And you had better go at once.' He was plainly very much upset. 'This is very sudden,' said Philip. And Lucy said, 'I do think it's silly. How shall we get home? All in a hurry, like this?' 'How did you get here?' 'By building a house and getting into it.' 'Then build your own house. Oh, we have models of all the houses you were ever in. The pieces are all numbered. You only have to put them together.' He led them to a large room behind the hall of Public Amusements and took down from a shelf a stout box labelled 'The Grange.' On another box Philip saw 'Laburnum Cottage.' Mr. Noah, kneeling on his yellow mat, tumbled the contents of the box out on the floor, and Philip and Lucy set to work to build a house with the exquisitely finished little blocks and stones and beams and windows and chimneys. 'I cannot bear to see you go,' said Mr. Noah. 'Good-bye, good-bye. Remember me sometimes!' 'We shall never forget you,' said the children, jumping up hugging him. 'Good-bye!' said the parrot who had followed them in. 'Good-bye, good-bye!' said everybody. 'I wish the  Lightning Loose  was not lost,' Philip even at this parting moment remembered to say. 'She isn't,' said Mr. Noah. 'She flew back to the island directly you left her. Sails are called wings, are they not? White wings that never grow weary, you know. Relieved of your weight, the faithful yacht flew home like any pigeon.' 'Hooray!' said Philip. 'I couldn't bear to think of her rotting away in a cavern.' 'I wish Max and Brenda had come to say good-bye,' said Lucy. 'It is not needed,' said Mr. Noah mysteriously. And then everybody said good-bye again, and Mr. Noah rolled up his yellow mat, put it under his arm again, and went, for ever. The children built the Grange, and when the beautiful little model of that house was there before them, perfect, they stood still a moment, looking at it. 'I wish we could be two people each,' said Lucy, 'and one of each of us go home and one of each of us stay here. Oh!' she cried suddenly, and snatched at Philip's arm. For a slight strange giddiness had suddenly caught her. Philip too swayed a little uncertainly and stood a moment with his hand to his head. The children gazed about them bewildered and still a little giddy. The room was gone, the model of the Grange was gone. Over their heads was blue sky, under their feet was green grass, and in front stood the Grange itself, with its front door wide open and on the steps Helen and Mr. Peter Graham. That telegram had brought them home.       .       .       .       .       .       .       . You will wonder how Lucy explained where she had been when she was lost. She never did explain. There are some things, as you know, that cannot be explained. But the curious thing is that no one ever asked for an explanation. The grown-ups must have thought they knew all about it, which, of course, was very far from being the truth. When the four people on the doorstep of the Grange had finished saying how glad they were to see each other, that day on the steps when Philip and Lucy came back from Polistarchia, Helen and Mr. Peter Graham came back from Belgium, Helen said: 'And we've brought you each the loveliest present. Fetch them, Peter, there's a dear.' Mr. Peter Graham went to the stable-yard and came back followed by two long tan dachshunds, who rushed up to the children frisking and fawning in a way they well knew. 'Why Max! why Brenda!' cried Philip. 'Oh, Helen! are they for us?' 'Yes, dear, of course they are,' said Helen; 'but how did you know their names?' That was one of the things which Philip could not tell, then. But he told Helen the whole story later, and she said it was wonderful, and how clever of him to make all that up, and that when he was a man he would be able to be an author and to write books. 'And do you know,' she said, 'I  did  dream about the island, quite a long dream, only when I woke up I could only remember that I'd been there and seen you. But no doubt I dreamed about Mr. Noah and all the rest of it as well, only I forgot it.'       .       .       .       .       .       .       . And Max and Brenda of course loved every one. Their characters were quite unchanged. Only the children had forgotten the language of animals, so that conversation between them and the dogs was for ever impossible. But Max and Brenda understand every word you say, any one can see that.       .       .       .       .       .       .       . You want to know what became of the redheaded, steely-eyed nurse, the Pretenderette, who made so much mischief and trouble? Well, I suppose she is still living with the Halma folk, teaching the Great Sloth to like his work and learning to be fond of people, which is the only way to be happy. At any rate no one that I know of has ever seen her again anywhere else. CHAPTER I THE BLUE LIGHT 'Mother, make Ted stop!' 'I'm not doing anything at all, Mother!' 'Yes he is, too! Please call him in. He's hurting my doll.' 'Oh, Janet Martin, I am not!' 'You are so, Theodore Baradale Martin; and you've just got to stop!' Janet, or Jan, as she was more often called, stood in front of her brother with flashing eyes and red cheeks. 'Children! Children! What are you doing now?' asked their mother, appearing in the doorway of the big, white farmhouse, holding in her arms a small boy. 'Please don't make so much noise. I've just gotten Baby William to sleep, and if he wakes up, , ' 'Yes, don't wake up Trouble, Jan,' added Theodore, or Ted, the shorter name being the one by which he was most often called. 'If you do he'll want to come with us, and we can't make Nicknack race.' 'I wasn't waking him up, it was you!' exclaimed Jan. 'He keeps pulling my doll's legs, Mother and, , ' 'I only pulled 'em a little bit, just to see if they had any springs in 'em. Jan said her doll was a circus lady and could jump on the back of a horse. I wanted to see if she had any springs in her legs.' 'Well, I'm  pretending  she has, so there, Ted Martin! And if you don't stop, , ' 'There now, please stop, both of you, and be nice,' begged Mrs. Martin. 'I thought, since you had your goat and wagon, you could play without having so much fuss. But, if you can't, , ' 'Oh, we'll be good!' exclaimed Ted, running his hands through his tightly curling hair, but not taking any of the kinks out that way. 'We'll be good. I won't tease Jan anymore.' 'You'd better not!' warned his sister, and, though she was a year younger than Ted, she did not seem at all afraid of him. 'If you do I'll take my half of the goat away and you can't ride.' 'Pooh! Which is your half?' asked Ted. 'The wagon. And if you don't have the wagon to hitch Nicknack to, how're you going to ride?' 'Huh! I could ride on his back. Take your old wagon if you want to, but if you do, , ' 'The-o-dore!' exclaimed his mother in a slow, warning voice, and when he heard his name spoken in that way, with each syllable pronounced separately, Ted knew it was time to haul down his quarreling colors and behave. He did it this time. 'I, I'm sorry,' he faltered. 'I didn't mean that, Jan. I won't pull your doll's legs any more.' 'And I won't take the goat-wagon away. We'll both go for a ride in it.' 'That's the way to have a good time,' said Mrs. Martin, with a smile. 'Now don't make any more noise, for William is fussy. Run off and play now, but don't go too far.' 'We'll go for a ride,' said Teddy. 'Come on, Jan. You can let your doll make-believe drive the goat if you want to.' 'Thank you, Teddy. But I guess I'd better not. I'll pretend she's a Red Cross nurse and I'm taking her to the hospital to work.' 'Then we'll make-believe the goat-wagon is an ambulance!' exclaimed Ted. 'And I'm the driver and I don't mind the big guns. Come on, that'll be fun!' Filled with the new idea, the two children hurried around the side of the farmhouse out toward the barn where Nicknack, their pet goat, was kept. Mrs. Martin smiled as she saw them go. 'Well, there'll be quiet for a little while,' she said, 'and William can have his sleep.' 'What's the matter, Ruth?' asked an old gentleman coming up the walk just then. 'Have the Curlytops been getting into mischief again?' 'No. Teddy and Janet were just having one of their little quarrels. It's all over now. You look tired, Father.' Grandpa Martin was Mrs. Martin's husband's father, but she loved him as though he were her own. 'Yes, I am tired. I've been working pretty hard on the farm,' said Grandpa Martin, 'but I'm going to rest a bit now. Want me to take Trouble?' he asked as he saw the little boy in his mother's arms. Baby William was called Trouble because he got into so much of it. 'No, thank you. He's asleep,' said Mother Martin. 'But I do wish you could find some way to keep Ted and Jan from disputing and quarreling so much.' 'Oh, they don't act half as bad as lots of children.' 'No, indeed! They're very good, I think,' said Grandma Martin, coming to the door with a patch of flour on the end of her nose, for it was baking day, as you could easily have told had you come anywhere near the big kitchen of the white house on Cherry Farm. 'They need to be kept busy all the while,' said Grandpa Martin. 'It's been a little slow for them here this vacation since we got in the hay and gathered the cherries. I think I'll have to find some new way for them to have fun.' 'I didn't know there was any new way,' said Mother Martin with a laugh, as she carried Baby William into the bedroom and came back to sit on the porch with Grandpa and Grandma Martin. 'Oh, yes, there are lots of new ways. I haven't begun to think of them yet,' said Grandpa Martin. 'I'm going to have a few weeks now with not very much to do until it's time to gather the fall crops, and I think I'll try to find some way of giving your Curlytops a good time. Yes, that's what I'll do. I'll keep the Curlytops so busy they won't have a chance to think of pulling dolls' legs or taking Nicknack, the goat, away from his wagon.' 'What are you planning to do, Father?' asked Grandma Martin of her husband. 'Well, I promised to take them camping on Star Island you know.' 'What! Not those two little tots, not Ted and Jan?' cried Grandma Martin, looking up in surprise. 'Yes, indeed, those same Curlytops!' It was easy to understand why Grandpa Martin, as well as nearly everyone else, called the two Martin children Curlytops. It was because their hair was so tightly curling to their heads. Once Grandma Martin lost her thimble in the hair of one of the children, and their locks were curled so nearly alike that she never could remember on whose head she found the needle-pusher. 'Do you think it will be safe to take Ted and Jan camping?' asked Mother Martin. 'Why, yes. There's no finer place in the country than Star Island. And if you go along, , ' 'Am I to go?' asked Ted's mother. 'Of course. And Trouble, too. It'll do you all good. I wish Dick could come, too,' went on Grandpa Martin, speaking of Ted's father, who had gone from Cherry Farm for a few days to attend to some matters at a store he owned in the town of Cresco. 'But Dick says he'll be too busy. So I guess the Curlytops will have to go camping with grandpa,' added the farmer, smiling. 'Well, I'm sure they couldn't have better fun than to go with you,' replied Mother Martin. 'But I'm not sure that Baby William and I can go.' 'Oh, yes you can,' said her father-in-law. 'We'll talk about it again. But here come Ted and Jan now in the goat-cart. They seem to have something to ask you. We'll talk about the camp later.' Teddy and Janet Martin, the two Curlytops, came riding up to the farmhouse in a small wagon drawn by a fine, big goat, that they had named Nicknack. 'Please, Mother,' begged Ted, 'may we ride over to the Home and get Hal?' 'We promised to take him for a ride,' added Jan. 'Yes, I suppose you may go,' said Mother Martin. 'But you must be careful, and be home in time for supper.' 'We will,' promised Ted. 'We'll go by the wood-road, and then we won't get run over by any automobiles. They don't come on that road.' 'All right. Now remember, don't stay too late.' 'No, we won't!' chorused the two children, and down the garden path and along the lane they went to a road that led through Grandpa Martin's wood-lot and so on to the Home for Crippled Children, which was about a mile from Cherry Farm. Among others at the Home was a lame boy named Hal Chester. That is, he had been lame when the Curlytops first met him early in the summer, but he was almost cured now, and walked with only a little limp. The Home had been built to cure lame children, and had helped many of them. Half-way to the big red building, which was like a hospital, the Curlytops met Hal, the very boy whom they had started out to see. 'Hello, Hal!' cried Ted. 'Get in and have a ride.' 'Thanks, I will. I was just coming over to see you, anyway. What are you two going to do?' 'Nothing much,' Ted answered, while Jan moved along the seat with her doll, to make room for Hal. 'What're you going to do?' 'Same as you.' The three children laughed at that. 'Let's ride along the river road,' suggested Janet. 'It'll be nice and shady there, and if my Red Cross doll is going to the war she'll like to be cool once in a while.' 'Is your doll a Red Cross nurse?' asked Hal. 'If she is, where's her cap and the red cross on her arm?' 'Oh, she just started to be a nurse a little while ago,' Jan explained. 'I haven't had time to make the red cross yet. But I will. Anyhow, let's go down by the river.' 'All right, we will,' agreed Ted. 'We'll see if we can get some sticks off the willow trees and make whistles,' he added to Hal. 'You can make better whistles in the spring, when the bark is softer, than you can now,' said the lame boy, as the Curlytops often called him, though Hal was nearly cured. 'Well,  maybe  we can make some now,' suggested Ted, and a little later the two boys were seated in the shade under the willow trees that grew on the bank of a small river which flowed into Clover Lake, not far from Cherry Farm. Nicknack, tied to a tree, nibbled the sweet, green grass, and Jan made a wreath of buttercups for her doll. After they had made some whistles, which did give out a little tooting sound, Ted and Hal found something else to do, and Jan saw, coming along the road, a girl named Mary Seaton with whom she often played. Jan called Mary to join her, and the two little girls had a good time together while Ted and Hal threw stones at some wooden boats they made and floated down the stream. 'Oh, Ted, we must go home!' suddenly cried Jan. 'It's getting dark!' The sun was beginning to set, but it would not really have been dark for some time, except that the western sky was filled with clouds that seemed to tell of a coming storm. So, really, it did appear as though night were at hand. 'I guess we'd better go,' Ted said, with a look at the dark clouds. 'Come on, Hal. There's room for you, too, Mary, in the wagon.' 'Can Nicknack pull us all?' Mary asked. 'I guess so. It's mostly down hill. Come on!' The four children got into the goat-wagon, and if Nicknack minded the bigger load he did not show it, but trotted off rather fast. Perhaps he knew he was going home to his stable where he would have some sweet hay and oats to eat, and that was what made him so glad to hurry along. The wagon was stopped near the Home long enough to let Hal get out, and a little later Mary was driven up to her gate. Then Ted and Jan, with the doll between them, drove on. 'Oh, Ted!' exclaimed his sister, 'mother'll scold. We oughtn't to have stayed so late. It's past supper time!' 'We didn't mean to. Anyhow, I guess they'll give us something to eat. Grandma baked cookies to-day and there'll be some left.' 'I hope so,' replied Jan with a sigh. 'I'm hungry!' They drove on in silence a little farther, and then, as they came to the top of a hill and could look down toward Star Island in the middle of Clover Lake, Ted suddenly called: 'Look, Jan!' 'Where?' she asked. 'Over there,' and her brother pointed to the island. 'Do you see that blue light?' 'On the island, do you mean? Yes, I see it. Maybe somebody's there with a lantern.' 'Nobody lives on Star Island. Besides, who'd have a blue lantern?' Jan did not answer. It was now quite dark, and down in the lake, where there was a patch of black which was Star Island, could be seen a flickering blue glow, that seemed to stand still and then move about. 'Maybe it's lightning bugs,' suggested Jan. 'Huh! Fireflies are sort of white,' exclaimed Ted. 'I never saw a light like that before.' 'Me, either, Ted! Hurry up home. Giddap, Nicknack!' and Jan threw at the goat a pine cone, one of several she had picked up and put in the wagon when they were taking a rest in the woods that afternoon. Nicknack gave a funny little wiggle to his tail, which the children could hardly see in the darkness, and then he trotted on faster. The Curlytops, looking back, had a last glimpse of the flickering blue light as they hurried toward Cherry Farm, and they were a little frightened. 'What do you s'pose it is?' asked Jan. 'I don't know,' answered Ted. 'We'll ask Grandpa. Go on, Nicknack!' CHAPTER II WHAT THE FARMER TOLD 'Well, where in the world have you children been?' 'Didn't you know we'd be worried about you?' 'Did you get lost again?' Mother Martin, Grandpa Martin and Grandma Martin took turns asking these three questions as Ted and Jan drove up to the farmhouse in the darkness a little later. 'You said you wouldn't stay late,' went on Mother Martin, as the Curlytops got out of the goat-wagon. 'We didn't mean to, Mother,' said Ted. 'Oh, but we're so scared!' exclaimed Jan, and as Grandma Martin put her arms about the little girl she felt Jan's heart beating faster than usual. 'Why, what is the matter?' asked the old lady. 'Me wants a wide wif Nicknack!' demanded Baby William, as he stood beside his mother in the doorway. 'No, Trouble. Not now,' answered Ted. 'Nicknack is tired and has to have his supper. Is there any supper left for us?' he asked eagerly. 'Well, I guess we can find a cold potato, or something like it, for such tramps as you,' laughed Grandpa Martin. 'But where on earth have you been, and what kept you?' Then Ted put Nicknack in the barn. But when he came back he and Jan between them told of having stayed playing later than they meant to. 'Well, you got home only just in time,' said Mother Martin as she took the children to the dining-room for a late supper. 'It's starting to rain now.' And so it was, the big drops pelting down and splashing on the windows. 'But what frightened you, Jan?' asked Grandma Martin. 'It was a queer blue light on Star Island.' 'A light on Star Island!' exclaimed her grandfather. 'Nonsense! Nobody stays on the island after dark unless it's a fisherman or two, and the fish aren't biting well enough now to make anyone stay late to try to catch them. You must have dreamed it, or made-believe.' 'No, we really saw it!' declared Ted. 'It was a fliskering blue light.' 'Well, if there's any such thing there as a 'fliskering' blue light we'll soon find out what it is,' said Grandpa Martin. 'How?' asked Ted, his eyes wide open in wonder. 'By going there to see what it is. I'm going to take you two Curlytops to camp on Star Island, and if there's anything queer there we'll see what it is.' 'Oh, are we really going to live on Star Island?' gasped Janet. 'Camping out with grandpa! Oh, what fun!' cried Ted. 'Do you mean it?' and he looked anxiously at the farmer, fearing there might be some joke about it. 'Oh, I really mean it,' said Grandpa Martin. 'Though I hardly believe you saw a real light on the island. It must have been a firefly.' 'Lightning bugs aren't that color,' declared Ted. 'It was a blue light, almost like Fourth of July. But tell us about camping, Grandpa!' 'Yes, please do,' begged Jan. And while the children are eating their late supper, and Grandpa Martin is telling them his plans, I will stop just a little while to make my new readers better acquainted with the Curlytops and their friends. You have already met Theodore, or Teddy or Ted Martin, and his sister Janet, or Jan. With their mother, they were spending the long summer vacation on Cherry Farm, the country home of Grandpa Martin outside the town of Elmburg, near Clover Lake. Mr. Richard Martin, or Dick, as Grandpa Martin called him, owned a store in Cresco, where he lived with his family. Besides Ted and Jan there was Baby William, aged about three years. He was called Trouble, for the reason I have told you, though Mother Martin called him 'Dear Trouble' to make up for the fun Ted and Jan sometimes poked at him. Then there was Nora Jones, the maid who helped Mrs. Martin with the cooking and housework. And I must not forget Skyrocket, a dog, nor Turnover, a cat. These did not help with the housework, though I suppose you might say they did, too, in a way, for they ate the scraps from the table and this helped to save work. In the first book of this series, called 'The Curlytops at Cherry Farm,' I had the pleasure of telling you how Jan and Ted, with their father, mother and Nora went to grandpa's place in the country to spend the happy vacation days. On the farm, which was named after the number of cherry trees on it, the Curlytops found a stray goat which they were allowed to keep, and they got a wagon which Nicknack (the name they gave their new pet) drew with them in it. Having the goat made up for having to leave the dog and the cat at home, and Nicknack made lots of good times for Ted and Jan. In the book you may read of the worry the children carried because Grandpa Martin had lost money on account of a flood at his farm, and so could not help when there was a fair and collection for the Crippled Children's Home. But, most unexpectedly, the cherries helped when Mr. Sam Sander, the lollypop man, bought them from Grandpa Martin, and found a way of making them into candy. And when Ted and Jan and Trouble were lost in the woods once, the lollypop man, ,  But I think you would rather read the story for yourself in the other book. I will just say that the Curlytops were still at Cherry Farm, though Father Martin had gone away for a little while. And now, having told you about the family, I'll go back where I left off, and we'll see what is happening. 'Yes,' said Grandpa Martin, 'I think I will take you Curlytops to camp on Star Island. Camping will do you good. You'll learn lots in the woods there. And won't it be fun to live in a tent?' 'Oh, won't it though!' cried Ted, and the shine in Jan's eyes and the glow on her red cheeks showed how happy she was. 'But I'd like to know what that blue light was,' said the little girl. 'Oh, don't worry about that!' laughed Grandpa Martin. 'I'll get that blue light and hang it in our tent for a lantern.' I think I mentioned that Jan and Ted had such wonderful curling hair that even strangers, seeing them the first time, called them the 'Curlytops.' And Ted, who was aged seven years, with his sister just a year younger (their anniversaries coming on exactly the same day) did not in the least mind being called this. He and Jan rather liked it. 'Let's don't go to bed yet,' said Jan to her brother, as they finished supper and went from the dining-room into the sitting-room, where they were allowed to play and have good times if they did not get too rough. And they did not often do this. 'All right. It  is  early,' Ted agreed. 'But what can we do?' 'Let's pretend we have a camp here,' went on Jan. 'Where?' asked Ted. 'Right in the sitting-room,' answered Jan. 'We can make-believe the couch is a tent, and we can crawl under it and go to sleep.' 'I wants to go to sleeps there!' cried Trouble. 'I wants to go to sleeps right now!' 'Shall we take him back to mother?' asked Ted, looking at his sister. 'If he's sleepy now he won't want to play.' 'I isn't too sleepy to play,' objected Baby William. 'I can go to sleeps under couch if you wants me to,' he added. 'Oh, that'll be real cute!' cried Janet. 'Come on, Ted, let's do it! We can make-believe Trouble is our little dog, or something like that, to watch over our tent, and he can go to sleep, , ' 'Huh! how's he going to  watch  if he goes to  sleep ?' Ted demanded. 'Oh, well, he can make-believe go to sleep or make-believe watch, either one,' explained Janet. 'Yes, I s'pose he could do that,' agreed Teddy. Baby William opened his mouth wide and yawned. 'I guess he'll do some  real  sleeping,' said Janet with a laugh. 'Come on, Trouble, before you get your eyes so tight shut you can't open 'em again. Come on, we'll play camping!' and she led the way into the sitting room and over toward the big couch at one end. Many a good time the children had had in this room, and the old couch, pretty well battered and broken now, had been in turn a fort, a steamboat, railroad car, and an automobile. That was according to the particular make-believe game the children were playing. Now the old couch was to be a tent, and Jan and Ted moved some chairs, which would be part of the pretend-camp, up in front of it. 'It'll be a lot of fun when we go camping for real,' said Teddy, as he helped his sister spread one of Grandma Martin's old shawls over the backs of some chairs. This was to be a sort of second tent where they could make-believe cook their meals. 'Yes, we'll have grand fun,' agreed Jan. 'No, you mustn't go to sleep up there, Trouble!' she called to the little fellow, for he had crawled up on top of the couch and had stretched himself out as though to take a nap. 'Why?' he asked. ''Cause the tent part is under it,' explained his sister. 'That's the top of the tent where you are. You can't go to sleep on  top  of a tent. You might fall off.' 'I can fall off now!' announced Trouble, as he suddenly thought of something. Then he gave a wiggle and rolled off the seat, bumping into Ted, who had stooped down to put a rug under the couch-tent. 'Ouch!' cried Ted. 'Look out what you're doing, Trouble! You bumped my head.' 'I, I bumped  my  head!' exclaimed the little fellow, rubbing his tangled hair. 'He didn't mean to,' said Janet. 'You mustn't roll off that way, Trouble. You might be hurt. Come now, go to sleep under the couch. That's inside the tent you know.' She showed him where Ted had spread the rug, as far back under the couch as he could reach, and this looked to Trouble like a nice place. 'I go to sleeps in there!' he said, and under the couch he crawled, growling and grunting. 'What are you doing that for?' asked Ted, in some surprise. 'I's a bear!' exclaimed Baby William. 'I's a bad bear! Burr-r-r-r!' and he growled again. 'Oh, you mustn't do that!' objected Janet. 'We don't want any bears in our camp!' 'Course we can have 'em!' cried Ted. 'That'll be fun! We'll play Trouble is a bear 'stead of a dog, and I can hunt him. Only I ought to have something for a gun. I know! I'll get grandpa's Sunday cane!' and he started for the hall. 'Oh, no. I don't want to play bear and hunting!' objected Janet. 'Why not?' ''Cause it's too, too, scary at night. Let's play something nice and quiet. Let Trouble be our watch dog, and we can be in camp and he can bark and scare something.' 'What'll he scare?' asked Ted. Meanwhile Baby William was crawling as far back under the couch as he could, growling away, though whether he was pretending to be a bear, a lion or only a dog no one knew but himself. 'What do you want him to scare?' asked Ted of his sister. 'Oh, oh, well, chickens, maybe!' she answered. 'Pooh! Chickens aren't any fun!' cried Ted. 'If Trouble is going to be a dog let him scare a wild bull, or something like that. Anyhow chickens don't come to camp.' 'Well, neither does wild bulls!' declared Janet. 'Yes, they do!' cried Ted, and it seemed as if there would be so much talk that the children would never get to playing anything. 'Don't you 'member how daddy told us about going camping, and in the night a wild bull almost knocked down the tent.' 'Well, that was real, but this is only make-believe,' said Janet. 'Let Trouble scare the chickens.' 'All right,' agreed Ted, who was nearly always kind to his sister. 'Go on and growl, Trouble. You're a dog and you're going to scare the chickens out of camp.' They waited a minute but Trouble did not growl. 'Why don't you make a noise?' asked Janet. Trouble gave a grunt. 'What's the matter?' asked Ted. 'I, I can't growl 'cause I'm all stuck under here,' answered the voice of the little fellow, from far under the couch. 'I can't wiggle!' 'Oh, dear!' cried Janet. Teddy stooped and looked beneath the couch. 'He's caught on some of the springs that stick down,' he said. 'I'll poke him out.' He caught hold of Trouble's clothes and pulled the little fellow loose. But Trouble cried, perhaps because he was sleepy, and then his mother came and got him, leaving Teddy and Janet to play by themselves, which they did until they, too, began to feel sleepy. 'You'll want to go to bed earlier than this when you go camping, my Curlytops,' said Grandpa Martin, as the children came out of the sitting-room. 'Are you really going to take them camping?' asked Mother Martin after Jan and Ted had gone upstairs to bed. 'I really am. There are some tents in the barn. I own part of Star Island and there's no nicer place to camp. You'll come, too, and so will Dick when he comes back from Cresco. We'll take Nora along to do the cooking. Will you come, Mother?' and the Curlytops' grandfather looked at his gray-haired wife. 'No, I'll stay on Cherry Farm and feed the hired men,' she answered with a smile. 'Why do they call it Star Island?' asked Ted's mother. 'Well, once upon a time, a good many years ago,' said Grandpa Martin, 'a shooting star, or meteor, fell blazing on the island, and that's how it got its name.' 'Maybe it was a part of the star shining that the children saw to-night,' said Grandma Martin. 'Though I don't see how it could be, for it fell many years ago.' 'Maybe,' agreed her husband. None of them knew what a queer part that fallen star was to have in the lives of those who were shortly to go camping on the island. Early the next morning after breakfast, Ted and Jan went out to the barn to get Nicknack to have a ride. 'Where is you? I wants to come, too!' cried the voice of their little brother, as they were putting the harness on their goat. 'Oh, there's Trouble,' whispered Ted. 'Shall we take him with us, Jan?' 'Yes, this time. We're not going far. Grandma wants us to go to the store for some baking soda.' 'All right, we'll drive down,' returned Ted. 'Come on, Trouble!' he called. 'I's tummin',' answered Baby William. 'I's dot a tookie.' 'He means cookie,' said Jan, laughing. 'I know it,' agreed Ted. 'I wish he'd bring me one.' 'Me too!' exclaimed Janet. 'I's dot a 'ot of tookies,' went on Trouble, who did not always talk in such 'baby fashion.' When he tried to he could speak very well, but he did not often try. 'Oh, he's got his whole apron  full  of cookies!' cried Jan. 'Where did you get them?' she asked, as her little brother came into the barn. 'Drandma given 'em to me, an' she said you was to have some,' announced the little boy, as he let the cookies slide out of his apron to a box that stood near the goat-wagon. Then Baby William began eating a cookie, and Jan and Ted did also, for they, too, were hungry, though it was not long after breakfast. 'Goin' to wide?' asked Trouble, his mouth full of cookie. 'Yes, we're going for a ride,' answered Jan. 'Oh, Ted, get a blanket or something to put over our laps. It's awful dusty on the road to-day, even if it did rain last night. It all dried up, I guess.' 'All right, I'll get a blanket from grandpa's carriage. And you'd better get a cushion for Trouble.' 'I will,' said Janet, and her brother and sister left Baby William alone with the goat for a minute or two. When Jan came back with the cushion she went to get another cookie, but there were none. 'Why Trouble Martin!' she cried, 'did you eat them  all ?' 'All what?' 'All the cookies!' 'I did eat one and Nicknack, he did eat the west. He was hungry, he was, and he did eat the west ob 'em. I feeded 'em to him. Nicknack was a hungry goat,' said Trouble, smiling. 'I should think he was hungry, to eat up all those cookies! I only had one!' cried Jan. 'What! Did Nicknack get at the cookies?' cried Ted, coming back with a light lap robe. 'Trouble gave them to him,' explained Janet. 'Oh dear! I was so hungry for another!' 'I'll ask grandma for some,' promised Ted, and he soon came back with his hands full of the round, brown molasses cookies. 'Hello, Curlytops, what can I do for you to-day?' asked the storekeeper a little later, when the three children had driven up to his front door. 'Do you want a barrel of sugar put in your wagon or a keg of salt mack'rel? I have both.' 'We want baking soda,' answered Jan. 'And you shall have the best I've got. Where are you going, off to look for the end of the rainbow and get the pot of gold at the end?' he asked jokingly. 'No, we're not going far to-day,' answered Ted. 'Well, stop in when you're passing this way again,' called out the storekeeper as Ted turned Nicknack around for the homeward trip. 'I'm always glad to see you.' 'Maybe you won't see us now for quite a while,' answered Jan proudly. 'No? Why not? You're not going to leave Cherry Farm I hope.' Ted stopped Nicknack that they might better explain. 'We're going camping with grandpa on Star Island.' 'Where's that you're going?' asked a farmer who had just come out of the store after buying some groceries. 'Camping on Star Island in Clover Lake,' repeated Ted. 'Huh! I wouldn't go there if I were you,' said the farmer, shaking his head. 'Why not?' asked Ted. 'Is it because of the blue light?' and he looked at his sister to see if she remembered. 'I don't know anything about a blue light,' the farmer answered. 'But if I were your grandfather I wouldn't take you there camping,' and the man again shook his head. 'Why not?' asked Janet, her eyes opening wide in surprise. 'Well, I'll tell you why,' went on the farmer. 'I was over on Star Island fishing the other day, and I saw a couple of tramps, or maybe gypsies, there. I didn't like the looks of the men, and that's why I wouldn't go there camping if I were you or your grandpa,' and the farmer shook his head again as he unhitched his team of horses. CHAPTER III OFF TO STAR ISLAND 'Oh Ted!' exclaimed Janet, as she drove home in the goat-wagon with her brother and Baby William, 'do you s'pose we can't go camping with grandpa?' 'Why can't we?' demanded Teddy. ''Cause of what that farmer said.' 'Oh, well, I guess grandpa won't be 'fraid of tramps on the island. It's part his, anyhow, and he can make 'em get off.' 'Yes, he could do that,' agreed Janet, after thinking the matter over. 'But if they were gypsies?' 'Well, gypsies and tramps are the same. Grandpa can make the gypsies get off the island too.' 'They, they might take Trouble,' faltered Jan in a low voice. 'Who?' asked Ted. 'The gypsies.' 'Who take me?' demanded Trouble himself. 'Who take me, Jam?' Sometimes he called his sister Jam instead of Jan. 'Who take me?' he asked, playfully poking his fingers in his sister's eyes. 'Oh, nobody,' she answered quickly, as she took him off her lap and put him behind her in the cart. She did not want to frighten her little brother. 'Let's hurry home and tell grandpa,' Jan said to Ted, and he nodded his curly head to show that he would do that. On trotted Nicknack, Trouble being now seated in the back of the wagon on a cushion, while Ted and Jan were in front. 'Maybe it was tramps making a campfire that we saw last night,' went on Jan after a pause, during which they came nearer to Cherry Farm. 'A campfire blaze isn't blue,' declared Ted. 'Well, maybe this is a new kind.' Ted shook his head until his curls waggled. 'I don't b'lieve so,' he said. 'Bang! There, me shoot you!' suddenly cried Trouble, and Ted and Jan heard something fall with a thud on the ground behind them. 'Whoa, there!' cried Ted to Nicknack. 'What are you shootin', Trouble baby?' he asked, turning to look at his little brother. 'Me shoot a bunny rabbit,' was the answer. 'Oh, there  is  a little bunny!' cried Jan, pointing to a small, brown one that ran along under the bushes, and then came to a stop in front of the goat-wagon, pausing to look at the children. 'Me shoot him,' said Trouble, laughing gleefully. 'What with?' asked Ted, a sudden thought coming into his mind. 'Trouble frow store thing at bunny,' said the little boy. 'It bwoke an' all white stuff comed out!' 'Oh, Trouble, did you throw grandma's soda at the bunny?' cried Jan. 'Yes, I did,' answered Baby William. 'And it's all busted!' exclaimed Ted, as he saw the white powder scattered about on the woodland path. 'We've got to go back to the store for some more. Oh, Trouble Martin!' 'I's didn't hurt de bunny wabbit,' said Trouble earnestly. 'I's only make-be'ieve shoot him, bang!' 'I know you didn't hurt the bunny,' observed Jan. 'But you've hurt grandma's soda. Is there any left, Ted?' she asked, as her brother got out of the wagon to pick up the broken package. 'A little,' he answered. 'There's some in the bottom. I guess we'll go back to the store and get more. I want to ask that farmer again about the tramps on Star Island.' 'No, don't,' begged Jan. 'Let's take what soda we have to grandma. Maybe it'll be enough. Anyhow, if we did go back for more Trouble might throw that out, too, if he saw a rabbit.' 'That's so. I guess we'd better leave him when we go to the store next time. How'd he get the soda, anyhow?' 'It must have jiggled out of my lap, where I was holding it, and then it fell in the bottom of the wagon and he got it. He didn't know any better.' 'No, I s'pose not. Well, maybe grandma can use this.' Teddy carefully lifted up the broken package of baking soda, more than half of which had spilled when Trouble threw it at the little brown rabbit. Baby William may have thought the package of soda was a white stone, for it was wrapped in a white paper. 'Well, I'm glad he didn't hit the little bunny, anyhow,' said Jan. 'Where is it?' and she looked for the rabbit. But the timid woodland creature had hopped away, probably to go to its burrow and tell a wonderful story, in rabbit language, about having seen some giants in a big wagon drawn by an elephant, for to a rabbit a goat must seem as large as a circus animal. 'I guess Trouble can't hit much that he throws at,' observed Ted, as he started Nicknack once more toward Cherry Farm. 'He threw a hair brush at me once and hit me,' declared Jan. 'Yes, I remember,' said Teddy. 'Here, Trouble, if you want to throw things throw these,' and he stopped to pick up some old acorns which he gave his little brother. 'You can't hurt anyone with them.' Trouble was delighted with his new playthings, and kept quiet the rest of the way home tossing the acorns out of the goat-wagon at the trees he passed. Grandma Martin said it did not matter about the broken box of soda, as there was enough left for her need; so Ted and Jan did not have to go back to the store. 'But I'd like to ask that farmer more about the tramps on Star Island,' said Ted to his grandfather, when telling what the man had said at the grocery. 'I'll see him and ask him,' decided Grandpa Martin. It was two days after this, two days during which the Curlytops had much fun at Cherry Farm, that Grandpa Martin spoke at dinner one afternoon. 'I saw Mr. Crittendon,' he said, 'and he told me that he had seen you Curlytops at the store and mentioned the tramps on Star Island.' 'Are they really there?' asked Jan eagerly. 'Well, they might have been. But we won't let them bother us if we go camping. I'll make them clear out. Most of that island belongs to me, and the rest to friends of mine. They'll do as I say, and we'll clear out the tramps.' 'I hope you will, Grandpa,' said Janet. 'Did Mr. Crittendon say anything about the queer blue light Jan and Ted saw?' asked Grandma Martin. 'No, he hadn't seen that.' 'Where did the tramps come from? And is he sure they weren't gypsies?' asked Jan's mother. 'No, they weren't gypsies. We don't often see them around here. Oh, I imagine the tramps were the regular kind that go about the country in summer, begging their way. They might have found a boat and gone to the island to sleep, where no constable would trouble them. 'But we're not afraid of tramps, are we, Curlytops?' he cried, as he caught Baby William up in his arms and set him on his broad shoulder. 'We don't mind them, do we, Trouble?' 'We frow water on 'em!' said Baby William, laughing with delight as his grandfather made-believe bite some 'souse' off his ears. 'That's what we will! No tramps for us on Star Island!' 'When are we going?' asked Ted excitedly. 'Yes, when?' echoed Jan. 'In a few days now. I've got to get out the tents and other things. We'll go the first of the week I think.' Ted and Jan could hardly wait for the time to come. They helped as much as they could when Grandpa Martin got the tents out of the barn, and they wanted to take so many of their toys and playthings along that there would have been no room in the boat for anything else if they had had their way. But Mother Martin thinned out their collection of treasures, allowing them to take only what she thought would give them the most pleasure. Boxes of food were packed, and a little stove made ready to take along, for although a campfire looks nice it is hard to cook over. Trouble got into all sorts of mischief, from almost falling out of the haymow once, to losing the bucket down the well by letting the chain unwind too fast. But a hired man caught him as he toppled off the hay in the barn, and Grandpa Martin got the bucket up from the well by tying the rake to a long pole and fishing deep down in the water. At last the day came when the Curlytops were to go camping on Star Island. The boat was loaded with the tents and other things, and two or three trips were to be made half-way across the lake, for the island was about in the middle. Nicknack and his wagon were to be taken over and a small stable made for him under a tree not far from the big tent. 'All aboard!' cried Ted, as he and Jan took their places in the first boat. 'All aboard!' 'Isn't this fun!' laughed Janet, who was taking care of Trouble. 'Dis fun,' echoed the little chap. 'I'm sure we'll have a nice time,' said Mother Martin. 'And your father will like it when he, too, can camp out with us.' 'I hope the tramps don't bother you,' said Mr. Crittendon, who had come to help Grandpa Martin get his camping party ready. 'Oh, we're not afraid of them!' cried Ted. 'Well, be careful; that's all I've got to say,' went on the farmer. 'I'll let you have my gun, if you think you'll need it,' he said to Grandpa Martin. 'Nonsense! I won't need it, thank you. I'm not afraid of a few tramps. Besides I sent one of my men over to the island yesterday, and he couldn't find a sign of a vagrant. If any tramps were there they've gone.' 'Wa-all, maybe,' said the farmer, with a shake of his head. 'Good luck to you, anyhow!' 'Thanks!' laughed Grandpa Martin. 'All aboard!' called Ted once more. Then Sam, the hired man, and Grandpa Martin began to row the boat. The Curlytops were off for Star Island, to camp out with grandpa. CHAPTER IV OVERBOARD 'Trouble! sit still!' ordered Janet. 'Yes, Trouble, you sit still!' called Mother Martin, as the Curlytops' grandfather and his man pulled on the oars that sent the boat out toward the middle of the lake. 'Don't move about.' 'I wants to splash water.' 'Oh, no, you mustn't do that! Splashing water isn't nice,' said Baby William's mother. ''Ike drandpa does,' Trouble went on, pointing to the oars which the farmer was moving to and fro. Now and then a little wave hit the broad blades and splashed little drops into the boat. 'Trouble want do that!' declared the little fellow. 'No, Trouble mustn't do that,' said his mother. 'Grandpa isn't splashing the water. He's rowing. Sit still and watch him.' Baby William did sit still for a little while, but not for very long. His mother held to the loose part of his blue and white rompers so he would not get far away, but, after a bit, she rather forgot about him, in talking to Ted and Jan about what they were to do and not to do in camp. Suddenly grandpa, who had been rowing slowly toward Star Island, dropped his oars and cried: 'Look out there, Trouble!' 'Oh, what's the matter?' asked Mother Martin, looking around quickly. 'Trouble nearly jumped out of the boat,' explained Grandpa Martin. 'I just grabbed him in time.' And so he had, catching Baby William by the seat of his rompers and pulling him back on the seat from which he had quickly sprung up. 'What were you trying to do?' asked Mrs. Martin. 'Trouble want to catch fish,' was the little fellow's answer. 'Yes! I guess a fish would catch  you  first!' laughed Ted. 'I'll sit by him and hold him in,' offered Janet, and she remained close to her small brother during the remainder of the trip across the lake. He did not again try to lean far over as he had done when his grandfather saw him and grabbed him. 'Hurray!' cried Teddy, as he sprang ashore. 'Now for the camp! Can I help put up the tents, Grandpa?' 'Yes, when it's time. But first we must bring the rest of the things over. We'll finish that first and put up the tents afterward. We have two more boatloads to bring.' 'Then can't I help do that?' 'Yes, you may do that,' said Grandpa Martin with a smile. 'Can't I come, too?' asked Janet. 'I'm almost as strong as Teddy.' 'I think you'd better stay and help me look after Trouble,' said Mrs. Martin. 'Nora will be busy getting lunch ready for us, which we will eat before the tents are up.' 'Oh, then I can help at that!' cried Janet, who was eager to be busy. 'Come on, Nora! Where are the things to eat, Mother? I'm hungry already!' 'So'm I!' cried Ted. 'Can't we eat before we go back for the other boatload, Grandpa?' 'Yes, I guess so. You Curlytops can eat while Sam and I unload the boat. I'll call you Teddy, when I'm ready to go back.' 'All right, Grandpa.' The tents were to be put up and camp made a little way up from the shore near the spot at which they had landed. Grandpa Martin took out of the boat the different things he had brought over, and stacked them up on shore. Parts of the tents were there, and things to cook with as well as food to eat. More things would be brought on the next two trips, when another of the hired men was to come over to help put up the tents and make camp. 'Oh, I just know we'll have fun here, camping with grandpa!' laughed Jan, as she picked up her small brother who had slipped and fallen down a little hill, covered with brown pine needles. 'Let's go and look for something,' proposed Ted, when he had run about a bit and thrown stones in the lake, watching the water splash up and hundreds of rings chase each other toward shore. 'What'll we look for?' asked Janet, as she took hold of Trouble's hand, so he would not slip down again. 'Oh, anything we can find,' went on Ted. 'We'll have some fun while we're waiting for grandpa to get out the things to eat.' 'I want something to eat!' cried Trouble. 'I's hungry!' 'So'm I, a little bit,' admitted Jan. 'Maybe we could find a cookie, or something, before they get everything unpacked,' suggested Teddy, and this was just what happened. Grandpa Martin had some cookies in a paper bag in his pocket. Grandma Martin had put them there, for she felt sure the children would get hungry before their regular lunch was ready on the island. And she knew how hungry it makes anyone, children especially, to start off on a picnic in the woods or across a lake. 'There you are, Curlytops!' laughed Grandpa Martin, as he passed out the molasses and sugar cookies. 'Now don't drop any of them on your toes!' 'Why not?' Ted wanted to know. 'Oh, because it might break them, I mean it might break your cookies,' and Grandpa Martin laughed again. 'Come now, we'll go and look for things,' proposed Ted, as he took a bite of his cookie, something which Jan and Trouble were also doing. 'What'll we look for?' Jan asked again. 'Oh, maybe we can find a cave or a den where a, where a fox lives,' he said, rather stumbling over his words. At first Ted had been going to say that perhaps they would look for a bear's den, but then he happened to remember that even talk of a bear, though of course there were none on Star Island, might scare his little brother and Jan. So he said 'fox' instead. 'Is there a fox here?' Jan asked. 'Maybe,' said Ted. 'Anyhow, let's go off and look.' 'Don't go too far!' called Grandpa Martin after them, as he started to unload the boat and get the camp in order. 'And don't go too near the edge of the lake. I don't want you to fall in and have your mother blame me.' 'No, we won't!' promised Ted. 'Come on,' he called to his little brother and sister. 'Oh, there you go again!' he cried, as he saw Trouble stumble and fall. 'What's the matter?' he asked. 'It's these pine needles. They're awfully slippery,' answered Janet. 'I nearly slipped down myself. Did you hurt yourself, Trouble?' she asked the little fellow. He did not answer directly, but first looked at the place where he had fallen. He could easily see it, because the pine needles were brushed to one side. Then Baby William tried to turn around and look at the back of his little bloomers. 'No, I isn't hurted,' he said. Janet and Ted laughed. 'I guess maybe he thought he might have broken his leg or something,' remarked Teddy. 'Now come on and don't fall any more, Trouble.' But the little fellow was not quite ready to go on. He stooped over and looked at the ground where he had fallen. 'What's the matter?' asked Janet, who was waiting to lead him on, holding his hand so he would not fall. 'Maybe he lost something,' said Teddy. 'Has he got any pockets in his bloomers, Jan?' 'No, mother sewed 'em up so he wouldn't put his hands in 'em all the while, and his hands were so dirty they made his bloomers the same way. He hasn't any pockets.' 'Then he couldn't lose anything,' decided Ted. He was always losing things from his pockets, so perhaps he ought to know about what he was talking. 'What is it, Trouble?' he asked, for the little fellow was still stooping over and looking carefully at the ground near the spot where he had fallen. 'I, I satted right down on him,' said Trouble at last, as he picked up something from the earth. 'I satted right down on him, but I didn't bust him,' and he held out something on a little piece of wood. 'What's he got?' asked Ted. 'Oh, it's only an ant!' answered Janet. 'I guess he saw a little ant crawling along, just before he fell, and he sat down on him. Did you think you'd hurt the little ant, Trouble?' 'I satted on him, but I didn't hurt him,' answered the little boy. 'He can wiggle along nice, see!' and he showed the ant, crawling about on the piece of wood. Perhaps the little ant wondered how in the world it was ever going to get back to the ground again. 'Put him down and come on,' said Ted. 'We want to find something before grandpa puts up the tent. Maybe we can find the den where the fox lives.' Trouble carefully put the little ant back on the ground. 'I satted on him, but I didn't hurted him,' again said the little fellow, grunting as he stood up straight again. Janet took his hand and they followed Teddy off through the forest. It was very pleasant in the woods on Star Island. The sun was shining brightly and the waters of the lake sparkled in the sun. The children felt glad and happy that they had come camping with their grandpa, and they knew that the best fun was yet to happen. 'Let's look around for holes now,' said Teddy, after they had gone a little way down a woodland path. 'What sort of holes?' asked Janet. 'Holes where a fox lives,' answered her brother. 'If we could find a fox maybe we could tame it.' 'Wouldn't it bite?' the little girl asked. 'Well, maybe a little bit at first, but not after it got tame,' said Teddy. 'Come on!' They walked a little way farther, and then Jan suddenly cried: 'Oh, I see a hole!' She pointed to one beneath the roots of a big tree. 'That's a fox den, I guess!' exclaimed Teddy. 'We'll watch and see what comes out.' The children hid in the bushes where they could look at the hole in the ground. For some time they waited, and then they began to get tired. The Curlytops were not used to keeping still. 'I'm going to sneeze!' said Trouble suddenly, and sneeze he did. And just then a little brown animal bounced out from under a bush and ran into the hole. 'Oh, it's a bunny rabbit!' cried Janet. 'He lives in that hole! Come on, Ted, let's walk. We've found out what it was. It isn't a fox, it's a bunny! Let's go and find something else on the island. Maybe we can find a big cave.' 'And maybe we'll find out what that blue light was,' cried Ted eagerly. 'I guess I don't want to look for that,' remarked Jan slowly. 'Why not?' ''Cause don't you 'member what Hal said about there bein' ghosts on this island?' and Janet looked over her shoulder, though it was broad daylight. 'Pooh!' laughed her brother. 'I thought you didn't believe in ghosts.' 'I don't, but, , ' 'I'm not afraid!' declared Teddy. 'And I'm going to look and see if I can't find the lost star that fell on the island.' 'Grandpa said it all burned up.' 'Well, maybe a little piece of it was left. Anyhow I'm going to look.' So they looked, but they found nothing like the blue light, and then Ted said he was hungry and wanted to eat. Nora and Mrs. Martin had set out a little lunch for the children on top of a packing box, and the Curlytops and Trouble were soon enjoying the sandwiches and cake, while their grandfather and the hired man finished unloading the boat. In a little while Grandpa Martin called: 'All aboard, Teddy, if you're going back with me!' 'I'm coming!' was the answer. 'I'm coming!' It did not take Grandpa Martin long to pull back to the mainland in the boat which was empty save for himself and Ted. The lake was smooth, a little wind making tiny waves that gently lapped the side of the boat. 'I think we'd better bring Nicknack over this trip,' said Grandpa Martin, when a second farm hand met him on shore and began to help load the boat for the second trip. 'The sooner we get that goat over on the island the better I'll feel.' 'Why, you're not afraid of him, are you?' asked the hired man whose name was George. 'No. But I don't know how easy it's going to be to ferry him over. He may start some of his tricks. So we won't put much in the boat this time. We'll leave plenty of room for the goat and the cart.' 'Oh, Nicknack will be good,' declared Ted. 'I know he will. Won't you, Nicknack?' and he put his arms around his pet. The goat had been driven down near the dock whence the boat started for Star Island. 'Well, unharness him and we'll get him on board,' said the farmer. 'Then we'll see what happens next.' Nicknack made no fuss at all about being unharnessed. His wagon was first wheeled on the boat, which was a large one and broad. Then Ted started Nicknack toward the craft. 'Giddap!' cried Teddy to Nicknack. 'We're going to camp on Star Island, and you can have lots of fun! Giddap!' Nicknack stood still on the dock for a few seconds, and he seemed to be sniffing the boat and the water in which it floated. Then with a little wiggle of his funny, short tail, he jumped down in near his wagon, and began eating some grass which Ted had pulled and placed there for him. 'It's a sort of bait, like a piece of cheese in a mouse trap,' remarked Ted, as he saw the goat nibbling. 'Isn't he good, Grandpa?' 'He's good now, Teddy; but whether he'll be good all the way over is something I can't say. I hope so.' George put in the boat as much as could safely be carried, with the goat as a passenger, and then he and Grandpa Martin began rowing toward Star Island. At first everything went very well. Nicknack seemed a little frightened when the boat tipped and rocked, but Ted patted him and fed him more grass, which Nicknack liked very much. 'I knew he'd be good!' Teddy said, when they were almost at the island, and could see Jan waving to them. 'I knew he'd like the boat ride, Grandpa.' 'Yes, he seems to like it. Now if we, , ' But just then something happened. The wind suddenly blew rather hard, roughening the water and causing the boat to tip. Nicknack was jostled over against the wagon, and some water splashed on him. 'Baa-a-a-a-a!' bleated the goat. Then, before anyone could stop him, he gave a leap over Teddy's head, and into the water splashed Nicknack. The goat had leaped overboard into the deepest part of Clover Lake! CHAPTER V THE BAG OF SALT 'Oh! Oh!' cried Teddy. 'Oh, there goes my nice goat! Catch him, Grandpa! Stop him!' Grandpa Martin stopped rowing and looked in surprise at the goat. So did the hired man. 'Well, just look!' exclaimed George. 'Oh, he'll be drowned! He'll be drowned!' wailed Teddy, tears coming into his eyes, for he loved Nicknack. 'He'll be drowned!' Grandpa Martin rested his hands on the oars and looked into the water. Then he smiled. 'I guess you'd have hard work drowning that goat,' he said. 'He's swimming like a fish!' 'And right straight for Star Island!' added the hired man. 'That's a smart goat all right! He knows where he wants to go, and the shortest way to get there!' Surely enough Nicknack was swimming toward the island. When he jumped out of the boat he floundered a little in the water, and splashed some on Teddy. Then he struck out, paddling as a dog does with his front feet. Nicknack turned himself about until he was headed toward the island, and then he swam straight toward it. 'Oh, won't he drown, Grandpa?' asked Teddy. 'I don't believe so, my boy! I guess Nicknack knows more than we thought he did. Maybe he didn't like the way we rowed, or he may have wanted a bath. Anyhow he jumped overboard, but he'll be all right.' 'See him go!' cried the hired man. Nicknack was swimming quite fast. Of course a goat is not as good a swimmer as is a duck or a fish, but Ted's pet did very well. On shore were Nora, Mrs. Martin, Janet, Trouble, and the farm hand who had gone over in the first boatload. They were watching the goat swimming toward them. 'Did you throw him into the water, Teddy?' asked Janet, as soon as the boat was near enough so that talking could be heard. 'He jumped in,' Ted answered. 'Isn't he a good swimmer?' 'I should say so! Here, Nicknack! Come here!' Janet called. The goat, which had been headed toward a spot a little way down the island from where Janet and her mother stood, turned at the sound of the little girl's voice and came in her direction. 'Oh, he knows me!' she cried in delight. 'Now don't shake yourself the way Skyrocket does, and get me all wet!' she begged, as Nicknack scrambled out on shore, water dripping from his hairy coat. But the goat did not act like a dog, who gives himself a great shaking whenever he comes on shore after having been in the water. Nicknack just let it drip off him, and began to nibble some of the grass that grew on the island. He was making himself perfectly at home, it seemed. The goat-wagon and the other things were soon landed, and then Grandpa Martin and one of the hired men went back for the last load. When that came back and the things were piled up near the tents, the work of setting up the camp went on. There was much yet to be done. Ted and Jan helped all they could in putting up the tents. So did Mother Martin and Nora, who was large and strong. She could pull on a rope about as well as a man, and there were many ropes that needed tightening and fastening around pegs driven into the ground so the tents would not blow over in the wind. Nicknack had been tied to a tree, near which, a little later, Ted and Jan were going to make him a little bower of leaves and branches. That was to be his stable until a better one could be built by Grandpa Martin, one that would keep Nicknack dry when it rained. At last the tents were up, one for sleeping, another for cooking, and a third where the Curlytops and the others would eat their meals. It was a fine camp that Grandpa Martin made, and he knew just how to do it right, even to digging little trenches, or ditches, around the tents so the water would run off when it stormed. 'And now let's take a walk and see what we can find,' suggested Ted to Janet, when Mother Martin said they might play about until supper was ready, for they had called the lunch they had eaten their dinner. 'Don't go too far,' cautioned Mother Martin. 'Oh, we can't get lost on this island,' said Ted. 'All we'd have to do, if we were, would be to walk along the shore until we came to this camp.' 'I know that. But it wasn't so much about your getting lost that I was thinking,' said Mrs. Martin. 'Oh, you mean, the tramps?' half whispered Janet. 'Well, I don't know whether there are any here or not,' went on her mother. 'But it's best to be careful until grandpa has had a chance to look about. Where is grandpa now?' 'He's getting some water at the spring,' Ted answered. There was a fine spring on Star Island, not far from the place where the tents had been set up, and Mr. Martin was now bringing pails of water from that and pouring them into a barrel which would hold so much that even Trouble would have plenty to drink no matter how thirsty he was. 'Well, don't go too far away until either grandpa or I have a chance to go with you,' added Mrs. Martin. 'Me come, too,' called Trouble, as he saw his brother and sister starting off. 'Oh, Mother!' exclaimed Teddy. 'No, you stay with mother,' said Mrs. Martin. 'I'll give you a nice drink of milk.' 'Don't want milk. I's had milk. Trouble want Ted an' Jan.' 'But you can't go with them, my dear. Come on, we'll go and throw stones into the lake and make-believe it's a great, big ocean!' Baby William pouted a little at first. He liked to have his own way. But when he saw what fun his mother was having tossing stones into the lake and making the water splash up, Trouble did the same, laughing at the fun he was having. 'Dis a ocean, Momsey?' he asked as he set a little stick afloat, making believe it was a boat. 'Well, we'll call it an ocean,' Mrs. Martin answered. 'But this water is fresh, and that in the ocean is very salty. Some day I'll take you and my two little Curlytops to the real ocean, and you can taste how salty the waves are. Now we'll throw some more stones.' Meanwhile Ted and Jan started for a little walk down the path that went the whole length of Star Island. 'Shall we take Nicknack?' asked Jan. 'No, let's wait until he dries off after his bath,' decided Teddy. 'I don't like wet goats.' 'Why, Teddy Martin! Nicknack got dried out hours ago!' 'Well, anyway, a goat isn't like a dog. We don't want a goat along when we are going out walking.' So Nicknack was left to nibble the grass, while the Curlytops wandered on and on. Grandpa and the hired men, having finished putting up the tents, were getting the stove ready so Nora could get supper. 'What are you looking for?' asked Jan when she noticed that her brother walked along as if searching for something. 'Are you trying to see if any tramps or gypsies are here on the island?' 'No. I was thinking maybe I could find that fallen star.' 'But didn't grandpa say it all melted up?' 'Maybe a piece of it's left,' went on Ted. This was the second time that he had spoken of the star that day. 'If I can't find a chunk of it, maybe I can find the hole it made when it hit,' he added. 'I'd like to find that. Maybe it would be bigger than the one I dug when I thought I could go all the way through to China.' 'Yes. The time Skyrocket fell in!' laughed Jan. ''Member that, Teddy?' 'I guess I do! Daddy had to go out in the night and bring him in. Come on, let's look for the hole the shooting star made.' 'All right.' The two Curlytops walked on over the island, looking here and there for star-holes. They found a number of deep places, but after looking at them, and poking sticks down into them, Ted decided that none of them had ever held a shooting star. 'Maybe bears made them,' half whispered Jan. 'There aren't any bears on this island!' Teddy declared. 'I hope not,' murmured his sister, as she looked over her shoulder and then kept close to her brother during the rest of the walk. Pretty soon the children heard their mother's voice calling them. They could hear very plainly, for the air was clear. 'I guess supper is ready,' said Janet. 'I hope it is!' sighed Ted. 'I'm awful hungry!' Supper was ready, smoking hot on the table in the dining-tent, when Ted and Jan reached the camp grandpa had made. 'Oh, how good it smells!' cried Ted. 'And how nice the white tents look under the green trees,' added his sister. 'I just love it here!' 'It is the nicest place we have yet been for the summer vacation,' said Mother Martin. 'This and Cherry Farm are two lovely places.' They sat down under the tent and began to eat. Nora had gotten up a fine supper, for a regular cook stove had been brought along, and it was almost like eating at Grandma Martin's table, only this was out of doors, for the sides of the tent were raised to let in the air and the rays of the setting sun. 'What's the matter, Father?' asked Mrs. Martin, as she saw the children's grandfather pause after tasting the potatoes. 'Is anything wrong?' 'I think I'd like a little more salt on these.' 'Yes, they do need salting. Nora, bring the salt please.' 'There isn't any, except what I used when I was cooking, a little I had in a salt-shaker.' 'Oh, yes, there must be. I brought a whole bagful. I saw it when I unpacked some of the things. There was a sack of salt.' 'Well, it isn't here now,' said Nora, as she looked among her kitchen things. 'Has anyone seen the bag of salt?' asked Mrs. Martin. She looked at Ted and Jan, who shook their heads. Then Trouble's mother looked at him. He was busy with a piece of bread and jam. One could have told Trouble had been eating bread and jam just by looking at his mouth and face. 'Did you see the salt, Trouble?' asked his mother. 'Iss, I did,' he answered, taking another bite. 'Where is it?' 'In de water,' he replied. 'I puts it in de water.' 'You put the salt in the water? What water? Tell mother, Trouble.' 'I puts salt in de lake water to make him 'ike ocean. Trouble 'ike ocean. Come on, I show!' and, getting down out of his chair, he toddled toward a little cove near the camp. The others, following him, saw something white on the ground near the edge of the lake. Grandpa Martin touched it with his finger and tasted. 'The little tyke did empty the whole bag of salt in the lake!' cried the farmer. 'Fancy his trying to make it like the ocean! Ho! Ho!' 'Oh, Trouble!' cried Mrs. Martin. 'You wasted a whole bag of salt, and now grandpa hasn't any for his potatoes!' CHAPTER VI TED AND THE BEAR Baby William looked a little bit frightened and ashamed as his mother spoke to him in that way. He loved his grandfather, and of course he would not have done anything to make him feel bad if he had thought. But Trouble was a very little fellow, though his father often said he could get into as many kinds of mischief as could the larger Curlytops. 'Oh dear! This is too bad!' went on Mrs. Martin. 'Why did you do it, Trouble? What made you empty the bag of salt into the lake?' 'Want to make ocean wif salt water,' was the answer. 'I suppose it's my fault, for telling him so much about the big sea and its salt water,' said Trouble's mother. 'He liked to hear me talk about the ocean, and I guess he must have been thinking about it more than I had any idea of. 'He must have tasted the water of the lake, and found it wasn't salty, and then he thought that, to make an ocean and big waves out of a lake, all he had to do was to put in the salt. I'm sorry, Father.' 'Oh, that's all right,' laughed Grandpa Martin. 'I guess I can get along without any more salt.' 'Trouble sorry, too,' said the little fellow, when he understood that he had done something wrong. 'Me get salt water for you,' and he started toward the place where he had emptied the bag into the water, carrying a spoon from the table. 'No, Trouble! Come back!' ordered his mother. 'I guess he wants to dip up some salt water for you,' she said laughingly to the children's grandfather, 'but he'd be more likely to fall in himself.' She caught Trouble up in her arms and kissed him, and then Nora managed to find a little salt in the bottom of the shaker, so Grandpa Martin had some on his potatoes after all. But Trouble was told he must never again do anything like that. He promised, of course, but Jan said: 'He'll do something else, just as bad.' 'I guess he will,' laughed Teddy. Supper over, Mr. Martin took his two men over to the mainland. On his return they all gathered about a little campfire grandpa made in front of the sleeping tent. The cot beds had been set up, and a mosquito netting was hung at the 'front door' of the white canvas house, though really there was no door, just two flaps of the tent that could be tied together. But the netting kept out the bugs. Fortunately there were no mosquitoes, though all sorts of moths, snapping bugs and other flying things came around whenever a lantern was lighted. 'Tell us a story, Grandpa!' begged Janet, when they had finished talking about the many things that had happened during the first day in camp. 'Tell us about the shooting star that fell on this island,' begged Teddy. 'Tell us about de twamps!' exclaimed Trouble, who ought to have been asleep, but who had begged to stay up a little longer than usual. 'I don't know anything about the tramps,' laughed grandpa, 'and I don't believe there are any on the island, though it is a large one, and it will take two or three days for us to walk all about it. 'As for the shooting star, which Teddy thinks about so much, I really didn't see it fall, and all I know is what the old men in the village have told me. It was many years ago.' 'And did you ever see the blue light?' asked Ted, thinking of what he and his sister had seen the night they were coming home from the little visit to Hal Chester. 'No, I never did; though I'd like to, so I might know what it was.' 'Children, how is grandpa ever going to tell you a story if you keep asking him so many questions?' laughed Mrs. Martin. 'All right, now we'll listen,' promised Teddy, and Grandpa Martin told a tale of when he was a little boy, and lived further to the north and on the edge of a big wood where there were bears and other wild animals. His father was a good hunter, Grandpa Martin said, and often used to kill bears and wolves, for the country was wild, with never so much as one automobile in it. Grandpa finished his story of the olden days by telling of once when he was a small boy, coming home through the woods toward dark one evening and being chased by a bear. But he crawled into a hollow log where the bear could not get him, and later his father and some other hunters came, shot the bear and got the little boy safely out. 'Whew!' whistled Teddy, when this was finished. 'I'd like to have been there!' 'In the log, hiding away from the bear?' asked his mother. 'No, I, I guess not that,' Ted answered. 'I'd just like to have seen it up in a tree, where the bear couldn't get me.' 'Bears can climb trees,' remarked Janet. 'Well, I'd go up in a little tree too small for a bear,' her brother answered. 'I guess you'd all better go to your little beds!' laughed Mother Martin. 'It's long past your sleepy time.' And the Curlytops and Trouble were soon sound asleep. It must have been about the middle of the night, anyhow it was quite late, when Teddy, who was sleeping in his cot next to one of the side walls of the tent, was suddenly awakened by a noise outside, and something seemed to be trying to get through. 'Oh! Oh!' cried Teddy, quickly sitting up in bed, and wide awake all at once. 'Oh, Mother! Something's after me! It's a bear! It's a bear!' 'Hush!' quickly exclaimed Mrs. Martin. 'You'll waken William, and frighten him!' 'But Mother! I'm sure it's a bear! He growled!' 'What is it?' asked Jan, from her cot on the other side of the tent. 'It's a bear!' cried Ted again. There did seem to be something going on outside the tent near Ted's side. There was a crackling in the bushes, and once something came pushing hard against the side of the white canvas house with force enough to make a bulge in it. Teddy jumped up from his cot and ran over to his mother, who was sitting up on her bed. 'Oh, Mother! It's coming in!' cried Teddy. 'Nonsense!' and Mrs. Martin laughed as she put her arms around her small son. 'What is it?' asked Grandpa Martin from the curtained-off part of the tent where he slept. 'It's a bear!' cried Janet. Just then, from outside came a loud: 'Baa-a-a-a-a!' Teddy looked very much surprised. Then he smiled. Then he laughed and cried: 'Why, it's our goat Nicknack!' 'I guess that's what it is,' added Grandpa Martin. 'But he seems to be in trouble. I'll go outside and look.' Taking a lantern with him, while Mrs. Martin and the children waited a bit anxiously, Grandpa Martin went to see what had happened. The Curlytops heard him laughing as they saw the flicker of his light through the white tent. Then they heard Nicknack bleating again. The goat seemed, to those inside, to be kicking about with his little black hoofs. 'Whoa there, Nicknack!' called Grandpa Martin. 'I'll soon get you loose!' There was more noise, more tramping in the bushes and then, after a while, Grandpa Martin came back. 'What was it?' asked Ted and Jan in whispers, for their mother had begged them not to awaken Trouble, who was still sleeping peacefully. 'It was your goat,' was the answer. 'He had got loose, and his horns were caught between two trees where he had tried to jump. He was held fast by his horns and he was kicking his heels up in the air, trying to get loose.' 'Did you get him out?' asked Jan. 'Yes, I pried the trees apart and got his head loose. Then he was all right. I tied him good and tight in his stable, and I guess he won't bother us again to-night.' 'Then it wasn't a bear after all,' remarked Jan, laughing at her brother. 'No, indeed! There aren't any bears on this island,' said her grandfather. 'Go to sleep.' Nothing else happened the rest of the night, and they all slept rather late the next morning, for they were tired from the work of the day before. The sun was shining over Clover Lake when Nora rang the breakfast bell, and Ted and Jan hurried with their dressing, for they were eager to be at their play. 'What'll we do to-day?' asked Janet, as she tried to get a comb through her thick, curly hair. 'We'll go for a ride with Nicknack,' decided Ted, who was also having a hard time with his locks. 'Oh, I wish I was a barber!' he cried, as the comb stuck in a bunch of curls. 'Why?' asked his mother, who was giving Trouble his breakfast. ''Cause then I'd cut my own hair short, and I'd never have to comb it.' 'Oh, I wouldn't want to see you without your curls,' Mother Martin said. 'Here, I'll help you as soon as I feed Trouble.' Trouble could feed himself when his plate had been set in front of him, and while he was eating Mrs. Martin made her two Curlytops look better by the use of their combs. After breakfast the children ran to hitch Nicknack to the wagon. Grandpa Martin was going back in the rowboat to the mainland to get a few things that had been forgotten, and also another bag of salt. 'And I'll hide it away from Trouble,' said Nora with a laugh. 'We don't want any more salty oceans around here.' 'Let's drive away before Trouble sees us,' proposed Jan to her brother. 'He'll want to come for a ride and we can't go very far if he comes along.' 'All right. Stoop down and walk behind the bushes. Then he can't see us.' Jan and Ted managed to get away unseen, and were soon hitching their goat to the wagon. Trouble finished his breakfast and called to them, wanting to go with them wherever they went. But his mother knew the two Curlytops did not want Trouble with them every time, so Baby William had to play by himself about camp, while the two older children drove off on a path that led the long way of the island. 'Maybe we'll have an adventure,' suggested Jan, as she sat in the cart driving the goat, for she and her brother took turns at this fun. 'Maybe we'll see some of the tramps,' he added. 'I don't want to,' said Jan. 'Well, maybe we'll see a bear.' 'I don't want that, either. I wish you wouldn't say such things, Teddy.' 'Well, what do you want to see?' 'Oh, something nice, flowers or birds or maybe a fairy.' 'Huh! I guess there's no fairies on this island, either. Let's see if we can find an apple tree. I'd like an apple.' 'So would I. But we mustn't eat green ones.' 'Not if they're too green,' agreed Teddy. 'But a little green won't hurt.' They drove on, Nicknack trotting along the path through the woods, now and then stopping to nibble at the leaves. At last the children came to a beautiful shady spot, where many ferns grew beneath the trees, and it was so cool that they stopped their goat, tied him to an old stump and sat down to eat some cookies their mother had given them. The Curlytops nearly always became hungry when they were out on their little trips. 'Wouldn't it be funny,' remarked Ted, after a bit, 'if we should see a bear?' 'The-o-dore Martin!' gasped Janet. 'I wish you'd keep quiet! It makes me scared to hear you say that.' 'Well, I was only foolin',' and Teddy dropped a 'g,' a habit of which his mother was trying to break him. And he did not often forget. 'If I saw a bear,' began Janet, 'I'd just scream and, , ' Suddenly she stopped because of a queer look she saw on her brother's face. Teddy dropped the cookie he had been about to bite, and, pointing toward a hollow log that lay not far off, said, in a hoarse whisper: 'Look, Jan! It  is  a bear!' CHAPTER VII JAN SEES SOMETHING For a moment after her brother had said this Janet did not speak. She, too, dropped the cookie she had just taken from the bag, and turned slowly around to see at what Teddy was pointing. She was just in time to see something furry and reddish-brown in color dart into the hollow log, which was open at both ends. Then Jan gave a scream. 'Oh!' exclaimed Ted, who was as much frightened by Janet's shrill voice as he was at what he had seen. 'Oh, Jan! Don't!' 'I, I couldn't help it,' she answered. 'I told you I'd scream if I saw a bear, and I  did  see one. It is a bear, isn't it, Teddy?' 'It is,' he answered. 'I saw it first. It's my bear!' 'You can have it, every bit of it,' said Jan, quickly getting up from the mossy rock on which she had been sitting. 'I don't want any of it, not even the stubby tail. I like to own half of Nicknack with you, but I don't want half a bear.' 'Then I'll take all of it, it's my bear,' went on Ted. 'Where're you going, Jan?' he asked, as he saw his sister hurrying away. 'I'm going home. I don't like it here. I'm going to make Nicknack run home with me.' Teddy got up, too. He did not stop to pick up the cookie he had dropped. 'I, I guess I'll go with you, Jan,' he said. 'I guess my bear will stay in the log until I come back.' 'Are you coming back?' asked Janet, as with trembling fingers she unfastened Nicknack's strap from around the stump to which he had been tied. 'I'm going to get grandpa to come back with me and shoot the bear,' replied Ted. 'I want his skin to make a rug. You know, like grandpa did with the bear his father shot.' Jan did not say anything. She got into the cart and turned the goat about, ready to leave the place. She gave a look over her shoulder at the hollow log into which she and Ted had seen the furry, brown animal crawl. It did not seem to be coming out, and Jan was glad of that. 'Giddap, Nicknack!' she called to the goat, and as the animal started off Ted jumped into the wagon from behind. 'I wish I had a gun,' he said. 'You're too little,' declared Jan. 'Oh, Ted! what if he should chase us? Was it an awful big bear? I didn't dare look much.' 'It wasn't so very big.' 'Was it as big as Nicknack?' 'Oh, bigger'n him, a lot.' 'Oh!' and again Jan looked back over her shoulder. 'I hope he doesn't chase us,' she added. 'I'll fix him if he does!' threatened Ted. 'I'll fix him!' 'How? You haven't any gun, and maybe you couldn't shoot it if you had, lessen maybe it was your Christmas pop gun.' 'Pooh! Pop guns wouldn't be any good to shoot a bear! You've got to have real bullets. But I can fix this bear if he chases us,' and Ted tried to look brave. 'How?' asked Jan again. She felt safer now, for Nicknack was going fast, and the hollow log, into which the furry animal had crawled, was out of sight. 'I'll make our goat buck the bear with his horns if he chases us, that's what I'll do!' declared Ted. 'Oh, that would be good!' exclaimed Jan in delight. 'Nicknack is brave and his horns are sharp. 'Member how he stuck 'em in the fence one day?' 'Yes,' answered Ted, 'I do. And I'll get him to stick 'em in the bear if he comes too close. Giddap, Nicknack!' and Ted flicked the goat with the ends of the reins. I think he wanted the goat to go faster so there would be no danger of the bear's chasing after him and his sister. Perhaps Ted thought Nicknack might be afraid of the bear, even if the goat did have sharp horns. The Curlytops were greatly excited when they reached the camp. Trouble was playing out in front and Grandpa Martin had just landed in the boat. 'What's that?' he cried, when he heard Ted's story. 'A bear in a hollow log? Nonsense! There are no bears on Star Island.' 'But I saw it, and so did Janet. Didn't you, Jan?' cried Ted. 'I saw something fuzzy with a big tail going inside the log,' answered Teddy's sister. 'Then it couldn't have been a bear,' laughed Grandpa Martin. 'For a bear has only a little short, stubby tail. I'll go to see what it is. I think I know, however.' 'What?' asked Mother Martin. 'Don't go into any danger, Father.' 'I won't,' promised the farmer. 'But I won't tell you what I think the animal is until I see it. I may be mistaken.' 'Maybe it's a twamp,' put in Trouble, who seemed to be thinking about them as much as Ted thought about the fallen star. 'Tramps aren't animals,' laughed Jan. 'Furry animals, anyway,' added Ted. 'Well, you stay here and I'll go see what it was,' went on grandpa, and he started off toward the hollow log with a big club. He was not gone very long, and when he came back he was laughing, as he had the night before when Nicknack gave them a scare. 'Just as I thought!' cried the children's grandpa. 'It was a big, red fox in the hollow log.' 'And not a bear?' asked Ted. 'Not a bear, Curlytop! Only a fox that was more frightened by you than you were by him, I guess. I knew it couldn't be a bear.' 'How did you get it out of the log?' asked Jan. 'Oh, I just tapped on the log with my club, and Mr. Fox must have thought it was somebody knocking at his front door. For out he ran, looked at me with his bright eyes, and then away he ran into the woods. So you Curlytops needn't be afraid. The fox won't hurt you.' 'I'm glad of that,' said Jan. 'Now let's go fishing, Ted.' 'All right,' he agreed. 'Can't you take Trouble with you?' asked his mother. 'I want to help Nora and grandpa do a little work around the camp.' 'Yes, we'll take him,' agreed Jan. 'But you mustn't put any salt in the water, Trouble, and scare the fish.' 'I not do it. I tatch a fiss myself.' They gave him a pole and a line without any hook on it so he could not scratch himself, and then Jan and Ted sat down under a shady tree, not far from camp, to try to catch some fish. They knew how, for their father had taught them, and soon Jan had landed a good-sized sunfish. A little later Ted caught a perch which had stripes on its sides, 'like a zebra,' as Jan said. After that Jan and Ted each caught two fish, and they soon had enough to cook. 'What do you Curlytops want me to do with these?' asked Nora, as the two children came along, laughing and shouting, with the fish dangling from strings each of them carried. 'Cook 'em, of course!' cried Teddy. 'That's what we caught them for, Nora, to have you cook them.' 'But won't they bite me?' asked the cook, pretending to be afraid. 'Oh, no! They can't!' explained Jan. 'They bit on our hooks, and now they can't bite any more, but we can bite them,' said Teddy. 'Oh, would you bite the poor fish?' asked Nora. For a moment the Curlytops did not know what to answer. Then Teddy replied: 'Oh, well, it can't hurt 'em to bite 'em after they're cooked, can it?' 'No, I guess not,' laughed Nora, 'no more than it can hurt a baked potato. Well, run along and I'll get the fish ready for dinner, or whatever you call the next meal. I declare, I'm so mixed up with this camping business that I hardly know breakfast from supper. But run along, and I'll fry the fish for you, anyhow.' 'Let's go and take a walk,' proposed Jan, when they had washed their hands in the tin basin that Mother Martin had set on a bench under a tree, with a towel and soap near by, for fish did leave such a funny smell on your hands, the little girl said. 'Where'll we walk to?' asked Teddy. 'Oh, let's go and look. Maybe we can find that cute little bunny we saw when we were looking for the den where the fox lived but didn't find him,' proposed Jan. 'All right,' answered Teddy, and they set off. They had not gone very far before Teddy stopped near a bush and began to look about him. 'What's the matter?' asked his sister. 'Why, I saw a bird fly out of here,' answered her brother, 'and it seemed just as if it had a broken wing. It couldn't fly, hardly.' 'Where is it?' asked Jan eagerly. 'Maybe if we take it to mother she can fix the wing. Once she mended a dog's broken leg, and he could walk 'most as good as ever when he got well, only he limped a little.' 'But a dog can't fly,' said Teddy. 'I know it,' agreed Jan. 'But if mother can mend a broken leg, she can fix a broken wing, can't she?' 'Maybe,' admitted her brother. 'Oh, there's the bird again, Jan! See how it flutters along!' and the little boy pointed to one that was dragging itself along over the ground as though its wings or legs were broken or hurt. 'Come on!' cried Teddy. 'Maybe we can catch the bird, Jan!' Brother and sister started after the little feathered songster, which was making a queer, chirping noise. Then Jan suddenly called: 'Oh, here's another!' And, surely enough, there was a second bird acting almost as was the first, fluttering along, half hopping and half flying through the grass. 'We'll get 'em both!' yelled Teddy, and he and Jan hurried along. But, somehow or other, as soon as they came almost to the place where they could reach out and touch one of the birds, which acted as though it could not go a bit farther, the little creature would manage to flutter on just beyond the eager hands of the children. 'That's funny!' exclaimed Teddy. 'I almost had one of 'em that time!' 'So did I!' added Janet. 'Now I'm sure I can get this one!' and she ran forward to grasp the fluttering bird, but it managed to hop along, just out of her reach. The one Ted was after did the same thing, and for some time the children hurried on after the birds. At last the two songsters, with little chirps and calls, suddenly flew high in the air and circled back through the woods. 'Well, would you look at that!' cried Teddy, in surprise. 'They can fly, after all!' gasped Janet. 'What d'you s'pose made 'em pretend they couldn't?' 'I, I guess they wanted to fool us,' said her brother. And that really was it. The little birds had built a nest in a low bush, close to the ground where the children could easily have reached it if they had seen it. And they were very close to it, though their eyes had not spied it. But the birds had seen the Curlytops and, fearing that Jan and Ted might take out the eggs in the nest, the wise little birds had pretended to be willing to let the boy and girl catch them instead of robbing the nest. Of course, Jan and Ted wouldn't have done such a thing as that! But the birds knew no differently. Not all birds act this way, pretending to be hurt, or that they can't fly, to get people to chase after them, and so keep far away from the little nests. But this particular kind of bird always does that. Some day, if you are in the woods or the fields, and see one bird, or two, acting in this queer way, as though it could not fly or walk, and as though it wanted you to hurry after it and try to catch it, if you see a bird acting that way you may be sure you are near its nest and eggs and this is the way the bird does to get you away. 'Let's look for their nest,' suggested Teddy, when the two birds had flown far away, back through the woods. 'Oh, no,' answered Jan. 'We don't want to scare them. Maybe we can look at the nest of a bird that won't mind if we watch her feeding her little ones.' And, a little later, they came to a bush in which was a robin's nest. In it were some tiny birds, and, by standing on their tiptoes, and bending the nest down a little way, the Curlytops could look in. The baby birds, which had only just begun to grow feathers, opened their mouths as wide as they could, thinking, I suppose, that Jan and Ted had worms or bugs for them. But the children did not have. 'Your mother will soon be along to feed you,' said Janet, and soon the mother bird did come flying back from the field. She seemed afraid at first, when she saw how close Jan and Ted were to her nest, but the children soon walked away, and then the robin fed her young. Ted and Jan had a nice walk through the woods and then they went back to camp. 'We'll take Trouble for a walk, so mother won't have to look after him so much,' said Janet. 'Come, Trouble!' 'Show me where the fox was,' begged Baby William, and Ted and Jan turned their steps that way. But there was no sign of the big-tailed animal in the hollow log, though the children pounded on it as Grandpa Martin said he had done. Then they wandered on a little farther in the beautiful woods. Jan saw some flowers she wanted to gather, and leaving the path where Ted stood to take care of his little brother, she began picking a handful. Janet saw so many pretty blossoms that she went a little farther than she meant to, and, before she knew it, she had lost sight of her two brothers, though she could hear them talking. Suddenly, after crawling through some bushes, Jan found herself on another path. On the other side of it she saw some black-eyed Susans. 'Oh, I must get some of them!' she cried. She darted across the path, and, as she was about to pick the flowers, she saw, standing behind a big tree, a man who had on very ragged clothes. He looked at Jan, who dropped her bouquet and gasped: 'Oh! Oh, dear!' The ragged man looked at Janet and smiled. But Jan did not smile. One thought only was in her mind. 'Here is one of the tramps!' [Illustration: 'HERE IS ONE OF THE TRAMPS!'] CHAPTER VIII TROUBLE FALLS IN Janet Martin thought it must have been all of five minutes that she stood staring at the ragged man and he at her, though, very likely, it was only a few seconds. A little while seems very long sometimes; for instance, waiting for a train, or for the day of the party to come. 'Are you looking for anything?' the man asked of Janet after a while. 'He doesn't speak like a tramp,' thought the little girl, who had occasionally heard them asking Nora, at the back door at home, for something to eat. 'I guess I'll answer him.' So she replied: 'I'm looking for flowers.' 'Well, there are some pretty ones here in the woods,' went on the ragged man. 'I saw some fine red ones a little while ago. If I had known I should meet you I would have picked them for you.' 'I wonder if he  can  be a tramp,' thought Janet. 'Do tramps pick flowers, or want to pick them?' What she said was: 'Thank you, but I think I have enough now.' 'Yes, you have a nice bouquet,' went on the ragged man, still smiling. He was dressed like a tramp, that was certain. But, somehow or other, Janet did not feel as afraid as she expected she would be when she thought of meeting a tramp. 'Do you live around here?' the man continued. 'Yes, we're camping in a tent,' Jan replied. 'My grandfather owns part of this island and we're with him, my mother and my brothers. We like it here.' 'Yes, it's fine,' said the ragged man, who Janet thought must be a tramp, even if he did not talk like most of them. 'So you live in a tent? Does the professor stay here all the while?' 'The professor?' repeated Janet, and she wondered what the long word meant. She was sure she had heard it before. Pretty soon she remembered. At school she had heard some of the teachers speak of the principal as 'Professor.' 'My grandpa isn't a professor,' explained Janet with a smile. 'He's a farmer.' 'Well, some farmers are scientists. Maybe he is a scientist,' went on the tramp. 'I was wondering if some one else was on this island looking for the same thing I'm looking for. Can you tell me, little girl, , ?' But just then, from somewhere back in the woods, a voice called. The ragged man listened a moment, and then he cried: 'All right! I'm coming!' Janet saw him stoop and pick up off the ground a canvas bag, through the opening of which she saw stones, such as might be picked up on the shore of the lake or almost anywhere on the island. 'I hope I shall see you again, little girl,' went on the tramp, as Janet called him afterward when telling the story. 'And when I do, I hope I'll have some red flowers for you. Good-bye!' Janet was so surprised by the quick way in which the man ran off through the woods with his bag of stones that she did not answer or say good-bye. She just stood looking at the quivering bushes which closed up behind him and showed which way the man had gone. Janet could not see him any longer. A moment later she heard the bushes behind her crackling, and, turning quickly, she saw Ted and Trouble coming toward her. 'What's the matter?' called her older brother. 'Did you see another bear, I mean a fox?' 'No. But I saw a tramp man,' replied Janet. 'Oh, but he was awful ragged!' 'A tramp!' cried Ted. 'Then we'd better get away from here. We'd better go and tell grandpa!' Janet thought the same thing, and, after telling Ted all that had happened and what she and the man had said, the Curlytops hurried back through the woods to the camp. 'A ragged man on the island; is that it?' asked Grandpa Martin, when Jan told him what had happened. 'It must be as Mr. Crittendon said, that there are tramps here. Though what they are doing I don't know. There isn't anything to eat here, except what we brought. And you haven't missed anything, have you, Nora? Has anybody been taking your strawberry shortcake or apple dumplings from the tent kitchen?' 'No, Mr. Martin, they haven't,' Nora answered. 'Well, maybe it was a tramp and perhaps it wasn't,' said Grandpa Martin. 'Still it will be a good thing to have a look about the island. I don't want strange men roaming where they please, scaring the children.' 'Oh, he didn't scare me, except at first,' Janet hastened to say. 'He spoke real nice to me, but his clothes were old and awful ragged. He wanted to know if you were a professor.' 'Well, I guess I'm professor enough to drive away tramps that won't work, and only want to eat what other people get,' returned the farmer. 'I'll have a look around this island to-morrow, and drive away the tramps.' 'And until then, don't you Curlytops go far away. Stay where I can watch you,' went on Mrs. Martin, shaking her finger at them, half in fun, but a great deal in earnest. 'We'll stay near the tent,' promised Jan. 'I'm going to help grandpa hunt the tramps,' declared Ted. 'No, Curlytop, you'd better stay with your sister and mother,' said the farmer. 'I don't really believe there are any tramps here.' 'But I saw him!' insisted Janet. 'I know you saw some one, Curly Girl,' and grandpa smiled at her. 'Of course there may be a strange man, maybe two, for you say you heard one call to the other. But they may have just stopped for a little while on this island. I'll have to ask them to go away, though, for we want to be by ourselves while camping. So, as there might be strangers around here who would not be pleasant, you'd better stay here, too, Teddy.' 'All right, I'll stay,' Teddy promised, and he tried to be happy and contented about it, though he did want to go with his grandfather on the 'tramp-hunt' as he called it. But, though Teddy was quite a good-sized boy for his age, there were some things that it was not wise for him to do. This was one of them. The next day Grandpa Martin, rowing over to the mainland, brought back with him one of his hired men. The two walked all over the island, only stopping for their lunch, and at night they had found no trace of anyone. 'If tramps were here they have gone,' said Grandpa Martin. 'I can't think why that man who talked to Janet should speak of a professor, though.' 'It  is  queer,' said Mrs. Martin. 'Never mind, I'm glad it is safe for the children to run about now. It has been hard work to keep them about the tents all this day.' 'I guess it has been,' laughed Grandpa Martin. 'Well, to-morrow they can run as much as they like.' Ted and Janet had lots of fun, playing on the shores of Clover Lake. They took off their shoes and stockings, and went wading. Trouble did the same, splashing about in his bare feet until he saw a little crawfish, darting from one stone to another under water to hide away. 'Trouble 'fraid of dem big water-bugs,' he said, as he ran out on the grassy bank. 'Don't want to wade any more,' and Ted and Jan could not get him to come in again that day. By this time the camp was well settled. They had stored away in the cooking tent many good things to eat, and whenever they wanted anything more Grandpa Martin would row over to the store on the mainland for it. Daddy Martin wrote from Cresco, where he was looking after his store, that he would soon be back at Cherry Farm, and then he would come out to the camp and spend a week. The Curlytops played all the games they knew. They took long rides with Nicknack, and often Trouble went with them. But it was not all play. Mrs. Martin thought it wise for Ted and Jan to have some work to do; so, each day, she gave them little tasks. They had to bring a small pail of water from the spring, gather wood for the evening campfire, and also some for Nora to use when she made the fire in the cook-stove. For Nora was a good cook, and many a fine pie or cake came out of the oven. Sometimes Ted and Jan helped around the kitchen by drying the dishes or helping set the table or clear it off. One afternoon, when it was almost time to get supper, Mrs. Martin sent Ted to the spring for a pail of water. She wanted one so they could all have a fresh drink, as it was rather warm that day. 'I'll go with you,' offered Janet. 'Me come too,' added Trouble. 'Yes, take him,' said his mother to Janet. 'He hasn't been out much to-day.' So Trouble toddled off with his brother and sister. Ted filled the pail at the bubbling spring, which was a large one, out of sight of the tents of the camp. Then he heard a strange bird whistling in a tree overhead, and, setting down the pail, he ran to see what it was. 'Oh, Jan,' called her brother a moment later, 'it's a big red and black bird. Awful pretty! Come and see him!' Jan ran to get a look at the scarlet tanager, as grandpa said later it was, and, without thinking, she left Trouble alone. Well, you can well imagine what Trouble did! For a long while, ever since he had been in camp, in fact, Baby William had wanted to dip a pail of water out of the spring. But of course he could not be allowed to do this, for he might fall in. Now, however, he saw his chance. 'Trouble bring de water,' he said, talking to himself while Teddy and Janet were looking at the pretty bird. The little fellow carefully emptied the pail his brother had filled. Then with it in his hand he went slowly toward the spring. He leaned over, but longer arms than his were needed to reach the pail down into the bubbling water. Trouble reached and stretched and reached again, and then, ,  'Splash!' Baby William had fallen in! CHAPTER IX TED FINDS A CAVE Janet and Ted returned from looking at the pretty scarlet bird just in time to see what happened to Trouble. They saw him fall into the spring. 'Oh!' cried Janet, clasping her hands. 'Oh, look!' 'He'll be drowned!' yelled Ted, and then he ran as fast as he could toward the place where he had last seen his little brother, for Baby William was not in sight now. He was down in the water. Perhaps Trouble might not have come to any harm, more than to get wet through by the time Ted reached him. Perhaps the little fellow might not have been drowned. At any rate, no harm came to him, even though Jan and her brother did not get there in time to help. The two Curlytops, their fuzzy hair fluttering in the wind, were half way to the spring when they saw coming from the bushes a ragged man. 'There he is!' cried Janet. 'Who?' asked Ted. 'The man who, talked to me, while I was picking flowers,' and Jan's voice came in gasps, for she was getting out of breath from having run so hard. 'There he is!' and she pointed. 'That's the tramp!' cried Ted. 'They  are  on the island, only grandpa couldn't find 'em!' 'Do you, do you s'pose he's goin' to take Trouble?' faltered Janet. Before Ted could answer, the Curlytops saw what the ragged man was going to do. They saw him stoop over the spring, reach down into it and lift something up. The 'something' was Baby William, screaming and crying in fright, and dripping wet. The ragged man set Trouble down on a rock near the spring, and then, waving his hand to Ted and Jan, he cried: 'He's all right, swallowed hardly any water. Take him home as soon as you can, though. I haven't time to stop, have to go to see the professor!' With that the man seemed to dive in between some high bushes, and the Curlytops could not see him any more. But Trouble was still sitting on the rock, the water from his clothes making a little puddle all around him, and he was crying hard, his tears running down his cheeks. 'Oh, Trouble!' gasped Jan, putting her arms around him, all wet as he was. 'Are you hurt?' asked Ted, looking carefully at his little brother. 'I, I, I fal, falled in an', an' I's all, all wetted!' wailed Trouble, his breath coming in gasps because of his crying, which he had partly stopped on seeing his brother and sister. 'I falled in de spwing, I did!' 'What made you?' asked Ted, while Jan tried to wring some of the water out of the little fellow's waist and rompers. 'I wanted to get de pail full for mamma.' 'But I filled the pail, Trouble. You oughtn't to have touched it,' said Teddy. He went to the spring and looked down in it. The pail was at the bottom of the little pool. 'It's a good thing that tramp got him out,' remarked Janet. 'He must be a nice man, even if his clothes are ragged.' 'I guess so, too,' agreed Ted. 'But he said we must take Trouble home. I guess we'd better.' 'Yes,' assented Jan. 'But he isn't hurt.' 'He wasn't in very long,' Ted said. 'The man got him out awful quick, quicker than we could. You lead him home, Jan, and I'll get the pail out of the spring. It's sunk like a ship.' 'How're you going to get it?' 'With a stick, I guess. You mustn't lean over the spring any more, Trouble.' 'No,' promised Baby William. But the Curlytops could not be sure he would keep his promise. He might for a time, while he remembered what had happened to him. With a crooked stick Teddy managed to fish up the pail after two or three trials. Then, filling it with water from the spring, he carried it back to camp, while Jan led the wet and dripping Trouble. 'Oh, my goodness! What's happened now?' asked Nora, as she saw the three children coming into camp. 'Did you go in swimming with all your clothes on, Trouble?' 'No. I falled into de spwing, I did!' 'And the tramp got him out!' added Jan. Then she and Teddy, taking turns, told what had happened. Mrs. Martin scolded Trouble a little, to make him more careful the next time. Then Grandpa Martin said: 'Well, there must be strangers on this island after all, though I could not find them. They must be hiding somewhere, and I'd like to know what for.' 'Maybe they're living in gypsy wagons,' suggested Jan. 'Or in a cave,' added Ted. 'They look as if they lived in a cave.' 'There isn't any cave on the island, as far as I know,' his grandfather told Ted. 'But I don't like those strange men roaming about our place here. They may not do any harm, but I don't like it. I'll have another look for them.' 'So will I,' added Teddy, but he did not say this aloud. Teddy had made up his mind to do something. He was going to look for those men himself, either in a cave or a gypsy wagon. Ted wanted to find the ragged man, find all of them if more than one; and there seemed to be at least two, for the one who had pulled Teddy out of the spring had spoken of another, a 'professor.' 'What's a professor?' asked Jan. 'Oh, it's a man or a woman who has studied his lessons and teaches them to others,' answered her mother. 'One who knows a great deal about something, such as about the stars or about the world we live in. Professors find out many things and then tell others, young people generally, about them.' 'I'm going to be a professor,' said Teddy. 'Are you?' inquired his mother with a smile. 'I hope you will get wise enough to be one.' But Teddy did not speak all that was in his mind. If a professor was one who found out things, then the small boy decided he would be one long enough to find out about the tramps, and perhaps find the cave where they lived, and then he could tell Jan. When Trouble had been put into dry clothes and sent to sleep by his mother's singing, 'Ding-dong bell, Pussy's in the well,' Jan and Ted sat by themselves, talking over what had happened that day. Ted was making a small boat to sail on the lake, and Jan was mending her doll's dress, where a prickly briar bush had torn a little hole in it. Early the next morning Ted slipped away from his place at the breakfast table, and motioned to Jan to join him behind the sleeping tent. Ted held his finger over his lips to show his sister that he wanted her to keep very quiet. 'What's the matter?' she whispered, when they were safe by themselves. 'Did you see the tramp-man?' 'No, but I'm going to find him!' 'You are?' cried Janet, and her eyes opened wide with wonder and surprise. 'Don't tell anybody,' went on Ted. 'We don't want Trouble to follow us. Come on off this way,' and he pointed to a path that led through the bushes back of the tent. Trouble was busy just then, playing in the sand on the shore of Clover Lake, while Mrs. Martin and Nora were clearing away the breakfast things. Grandpa Martin was raking up around the tents, so no one saw the Curlytops slip away. 'Which way are you going?' asked Jan of her brother. 'Over to the spring.' 'What for? To get more water? Where's your pail?' 'I don't have to get water yet,' answered Ted. 'I'm going to the spring to look to see if I can tell which way that tramp went. Don't you know how Indians do, look at the leaves and grass in the woods, and they can tell by the marks which way anybody went? Mother read us a story once like that.' 'I don't like Indians,' remarked Jan somewhat shortly, half turning back. 'Oh, there's no Indians!' exclaimed Ted impatiently. 'I was only sayin' what they did. Come on!' So Jan followed her brother, though she was a little bit afraid. However, she saw nothing to frighten her, and it was nice in the woods. The wind was blowing through the trees, the birds were singing and it was cool and pleasant. The Curlytops soon came to the spring where Trouble had fallen in. 'Now we must look all around,' declared Teddy. 'What for?' his sister demanded again. 'To tell which way the tramp-man went. Then we can find his cave.' 'Maybe he lives in a wagon or a tent.' 'Then we'll find them. Come on, help look!' 'I don't know how,' confessed Janet. 'Well, look for a place where the bushes are broken down and where you see footprints in the dirt. That's the way Indians tell. Mother read it out of a book to us.' So Jan and Ted looked all around the spring, and at last Ted found a place where it seemed as if some one had run through in a hurry, for twigs were broken off the bushes, and, by looking down at the ground, he saw the marks of shoes in the dirt. Of course Ted could not tell who had made them, but he thought surely it must have been the tramp who had pulled Trouble from the spring. Ted was sure they were not the footprints of himself and his sister, for their own were much smaller. 'Come on, Jan!' cried Teddy. 'We'll find that tramp now or, anyway, the place where he hides.' He pushed on through the bushes. There seemed to be a sort of path leading away from the spring, which was not the same path that Ted and Grandpa Martin took when they went from the camp to the water-hole to fill the pail each day. On and on went Ted, with Jan following. She was so excited now at the thought that perhaps they might find something, that she was not a bit frightened. 'Wait a minute! Wait for me, Teddy!' she called, as her brother hurried on ahead of her. 'Come on, Jan!' he called. 'There's a good path here, and I guess I see something. Oh, look here! Oh, Jan! Oh! Oh!' suddenly cried Teddy. Then his voice seemed to fade away, as if he had all at once gone down the cellar, and Jan could hear him calling faintly. 'Oh, Teddy! What's the matter? What's the matter?' she cried as she ran on through the bushes. 'I've found the cave!' was his answer, so faint and far away that Jan could hardly hear. 'I've found the cave. I fell right into it! Come on!' CHAPTER X THE GRAPEVINE SWING Wondering what had happened to her brother, Jan hurried on toward the place from which his voice came. It sounded more than ever as if he were down a cellar. 'But there can't be any cellars in these woods,' thought the little girl. 'Where are you, Teddy?' she called after a bit. 'I can't see you!' 'Here I am, right behind you!' was the answer, and Jan, turning quickly, saw the head of her brother sticking up out of a hole in the ground. 'Oh! Oh!' exclaimed Ted's sister. 'Where's the rest of you? Where's your legs and your feet?' 'Down in the hole,' explained Teddy. 'I'm in the cave. I fell in. That's how I found it.' 'Is it a real cave?' asked Janet. 'It is. It goes away back under the ground, only I didn't go in 'cause it's so dark. I'm going to get a light and see what's there.' 'I'm not!' said Jan, very decidedly. 'Well, then I'll get grandpa. Maybe this is the cave where the tramps live. Come and look where I am. You won't fall in.' 'How did you find it?' asked Janet, as she walked toward the hole, down in which Teddy was standing. It was a little way from the path the two Curlytops had walked along through the woods, the path leading from the spring. 'I just fell in it, I told you,' Ted answered. 'I was walking along, and, all at once, I slipped down through the dried leaves. First I thought I was going down in a big hole, but it isn't over my head and a lot of leaves went down with me, so I didn't get jounced hardly at all.' Jan went to the edge and looked down in the hole. It seemed to be a large one in between two big rocks, and Ted showed her where the hole slanted downward and went farther underground. It was dark there, and Jan made up her mind she would never go into it, even if Ted did. 'You'd better come up,' she said at last. 'Maybe mother wouldn't like it. Besides, there might be snakes down in there.' 'Oh! I didn't think about them!' exclaimed Ted, and he tried to scramble up, but it was not so easy as he had hoped. He was a little excited, too, since Janet had spoken of snakes. Teddy did not like them, and they might be in among the leaves that had fallen down into the hole with him. 'Can't you get up?' Jan asked, when her brother had slipped back two or three times. 'Maybe I could if you'd let me take hold of your hand,' suggested Teddy. 'Then you'd pull me in, and we'd both be down there.' Ted saw that this was so. He tried again to get out, but could not, for mixed with the leaves were many dry, brown pine needles from the trees growing overhead; and if you have ever been in the woods you know how slippery pine needles are when the ground is covered with them. Teddy slipped back again and again. 'Oh, Ted! can't you  ever  get up?' asked Janet, almost ready to cry. 'Oh. I'll get out somehow,' he said. Then dangling down from a tree behind his sister, he saw a long wild grapevine, which was almost like a piece of rope. 'If I had hold of that I could pull myself out,' Teddy said. 'See if you can reach it to me, Jan.' After two or three trials his sister did this. Then, holding to a loose end of the grapevine while the other end was twined fast round a tree, Teddy pulled himself out of the hole. Once on firm ground he made the loose end of the grapevine fast to a stone that lay near the edge of the hole. 'What made you do that?' asked Janet. 'So the next time I get down there I can pull myself out,' Teddy answered. 'Are you going down there again?' Jan queried. 'Course I am!' declared Ted. 'I didn't half look in the cave. It's a big place. I could see in only a little way, 'cause it was so dark. I'm goin' to tell grandpa and have him bring a lantern.' Grandpa Martin was surprised when Ted and Jan told him what they had found in the woods. 'I didn't suppose there was a cave on the island,' said the farmer. 'I must have a look at it.' 'And may I come? And will you take a lantern?' asked Teddy eagerly. 'Well, yes, I guess so,' said grandpa slowly. 'Oh, Father, do you think it is safe?' asked Mrs. Martin. 'Yes, I think so. I won't go very far in with the children. It may be only the den of a fox or some small animal, and not a real cave.' 'I think it's a big cave,' declared Ted. 'Come on, Grandpa.' 'Me come!' cried Trouble, as the two Curlytops set off with Grandpa Martin through the woods, toward the place where Teddy had fallen down with the pile of leaves. 'Me come!' 'No, you stay with me,' laughed Mother Martin, catching him up in her arms. Trouble did not want to stay behind, not having been with his brother and sister of late as much as he wished. 'We'll bake a patty-cake!' Mrs. Martin added, and then Trouble laughed, for he liked to help Nora bake. That is, he thought he helped. And at least he helped to eat what Nora took out of the oven. 'Now show me where the cave is,' said Grandpa Martin to Ted, as they neared the place. 'But be careful not to fall into it again.' 'Oh, I've got a grapevine rope so I can pull myself out,' said Jan's brother. 'Here it is, over this way.' Teddy Martin was an observing little fellow. He could find his way around in the woods very well, once he had been to a place, and he did not go wrong this time. He led his grandfather right to the entrance of the cave. And it proved to be a real cave. Grandpa Martin found this out when he jumped down into the place where Teddy had fallen, and when the lantern had been lighted and flashed into the dark hole. 'Yes, it's a cave all right,' the children's grandfather said. 'And to think the many times I've been on this island I never found it! Well, I'll go in a little way.' 'Can't I come?' asked Ted, as he saw his grandfather start into the dark hole which spread out from the open place into which Ted had fallen. 'I'm not coming,' declared Janet, 'and I don't want to stay here all alone.' 'You stay there with your sister, Curlytop,' directed Mr. Martin. 'If I find out it's all right and is safe, I'll come back and take you both in a little way.' Grandpa Martin walked into the dark hole, his lantern flickering like a firefly at night. The Curlytops watched it until they could no longer see the gleam. Then they waited expectantly. 'Maybe somethin'll grab grandpa,' said Jan, after a bit. 'What?' asked Ted. 'A fox, or somethin'!' 'Pooh, he isn't afraid of a fox!' 'Well, a bear, maybe!' 'There isn't any bears here, Janet Martin! I'm not afraid.' Perhaps Ted said this because, just then, he saw his grandfather coming out of the cave. The farmer had not been gone very long. 'Is it a cave?' called Ted. 'A sure-enough one?' added his sister. 'Yes, it's a sure-enough cave. But there's nothing in it.' 'No wild animals?' Jan demanded. 'Not even a mouse, as far as I could see,' laughed Mr. Martin. 'But some one had been in the cave eating his lunch.' 'Maybe there was a picnic, Grandpa,' suggested Ted. 'No, I think only one or two persons were in the big hole,' said his grandfather. 'For it  is  a big hole, larger than I thought it was. I could stand up straight once I was inside.' 'Take us in!' begged Ted. 'Yes, I think it will be all right. Come along, Jan. I'll hold your hand, and there isn't anything of which to be afraid. Come on!' So Janet and Teddy went into the cave. By the light of grandpa's lantern they could see that it was a large place, a regular underground house, a cave just like those of which they had read in fairy stories. 'And was there somebody here, really?' asked Ted eagerly. 'Yes,' answered his grandfather. 'See. Here are bits of bread scattered about, and papers in which some one brought his lunch here.' 'Maybe it was the tramps,' whispered Janet. 'Maybe,' agreed Mr. Martin. 'I must have another look over the island.' There was not much else in the cave that they could see with the one lantern. Grandpa Martin wanted to look about more, and back in the far corners, but he did not like to take the children along, and Jan held tightly to his hand as if she feared she would lose him. 'I'll come here alone some other time, and see what I can find,' thought Grandpa Martin to himself, as they came out. 'I don't like it in there,' said Jan, once they were again out in the sunshine. 'I don't like caves.' 'I do,' declared Ted. 'When Hal Chester comes to visit me, as he said he would, he and I will look all through this cave.' 'Is Hal coming?' asked Jan, remembering the boy, once lame but now cured, who had played with them and told them about Princess Blue Eyes. 'Yes, mother asked him to come and spend a week, and he said he would. We'll have some fun in the cave.' 'What do you suppose the big hole can be?' asked Mrs. Martin, when Grandpa Martin and the children reached camp after their visit to the strange place. 'I don't know,' he answered. 'It doesn't seem to have been dug with picks and shovels. It's just a natural cave I guess, and some fishermen may have eaten their lunch there one day when it rained. But there is no one in it now.' Ted and Jan talked much about the cave the rest of that day. They went for a ride in the wagon drawn by Nicknack, taking Trouble with them. On their way back Jan said: 'Oh, I wish I had a swing.' 'It would be fun,' agreed Ted. 'Maybe I can make one.' 'You'll have to get a rope,' said his sister. 'Grandpa is going to row over in the boat to-morrow. Ask him to bring us one.' 'No, he don't need to bring us a rope,' went on her brother. 'Why not?' ''Cause I can get a rope in the woods.' 'A rope in the woods? Oh, Teddy Martin, you can not! Ropes don't grow on trees.' 'The kind I mean does,' answered Ted with a laugh. 'Wait and I'll show you.' When Nicknack had been put in the new stable which Grandpa Martin had built for him, Teddy, followed by Jan and Trouble, walked a little way into the woods. Ted carried with him a piece of old carpet. 'What's that for?' his sister asked. 'For a swing board,' he answered. 'But where's the swing rope?' 'Here!' cried Ted suddenly. He pointed to a long wild grapevine, which hung dangling between two trees, around which it was twined. The vine was a very long one, and as thick around as the piece Teddy had used to pull himself out of the hole near the cave. It did seem like a regular swing. 'Well, maybe,' murmured Jan. 'Now we can have some fun!' cried Ted. He folded the piece of carpet and laid it over the grapevine. Then he sat down, gave a push on the ground with his feet, and away he swung as nicely as though he was in a regular swing, made with a rope from the store. 'Oh, how nice!' cried Janet. 'Let me try it, Teddy.' 'Wait till I see if it's strong enough.' He swung back and forward several more times and then let his sister try it. She, too, swayed to and fro in the grapevine swing, which was in a shady place in the woods. Then Trouble, who had seen what was going on, cried: 'I want to swing, too! I want to swing!' 'I'll take you on my lap,' offered Janet, and this she did. 'I'll push you,' offered Teddy, and he gave his sister and his baby brother a long push in the grapevine swing. But, just as they were going nicely and Trouble was laughing in delight, there was a sudden cracking sound and Janet cried: 'Oh, I'm falling! I'm falling! The swing is coming down!' And that is just what happened. CHAPTER XI TROUBLE MAKES A CAKE With a crackle and a snap the grapevine swing sagged down on one side. Janet tried to hold Trouble in her arms, but he slipped from her lap, just as she slipped off the piece of carpet which Ted had folded for the seat of the swing. Then Janet toppled down as the vine broke, and she and her little brother came together in a heap on the ground. 'Oh!' exclaimed Ted. 'Are you hurt?' Neither Jan nor Trouble answered him for a moment. Then Baby William began to cry. Jan lay still on the ground for a second or two, and then she jumped up with a laugh. 'I'm not hurt a bit!' she said. 'I fell right in a pile of leaves, and it was like jouncing up and down in the hay.' 'What's the matter with Trouble?' asked Ted. Baby William kept on crying. 'Never mind!' put in Jan. 'Sister'll kiss it and make it all better! Where is you hurt, Trouble dear?' The little fellow stopped crying and looked up at Jan, his eyes filled with tears. 'My posy-tree is hurted,' he said, holding a broken flower out to his sister. 'Swing broked my posy-tree!' Trouble called any weed, flower or bunch of grass he happened to pick a 'posy-tree.' 'Oh, I guess he isn't hurt,' remarked Teddy. 'If it's only a broken posy-tree I'll get you another,' he said kindly. 'Are you all right, Trouble? Can you stand up?' for he feared, after all, lest Baby William's legs might have been hurt, since they were doubled up under him. Trouble showed he was all right by getting up and walking about. He had stopped crying, and Ted and Jan could see that he, too, had fallen on a pile of soft leaves near the swing, so he was only 'jiggled up,' as Jan called it. One side of the grapevine swing had torn loose from the tree, and thus it had come down with Jan and Trouble. 'I guess it wasn't strong enough for two,' said Ted. 'Maybe I can find another grapevine.' 'I'd like a rope swing better,' Janet said. 'Then it wouldn't tumble down.' 'I guess that's so,' agreed her brother. 'We'll ask grandpa to get one.' Grandpa Martin laughed when he heard what had happened to the grapevine swing, and promised to make a real one of rope for the Curlytops. This he did a day or so afterward, so that Ted and Jan had a fine swing in their camp on Star Island, as well as one at Cherry Farm. They were two very fortunate children, I think, to have such a grandfather. 'Where are you going now, Grandpa?' called Jan one day, as she saw the farmer getting the boat ready for use. 'I'm going over to the mainland to get some things for our camp,' answered Mr. Martin. 'They came from a big store in some boxes and crates, and they're at the railroad station. I'm going over to get them. Do you Curlytops want to come along?' 'Well, I just guess we do!' cried Ted. 'Me want to come!' begged Trouble. 'Not this time, Dear,' said his mother. 'You stay with me, and we will have some fun. Let Jan and Ted go.' Trouble was going to cry, but when Nora gave him a cookie he changed his mind and ate the little cake instead, though I think one or two tears splotched down on it and made it a bit salty. But Trouble did not seem to mind. Ted and Jan had lots of fun riding back in the boat to the main shore with their grandfather. When the boat was almost at the dock Mr. Martin let the two children take hold of one of the oars and help him row. Of course the Curlytops could not pull very much, but they did pretty well, and it helped them to know how a boat is made to go through the water, when it has no steam engine or gasolene motor to make it glide along, or sails on which the wind can blow to push it. 'You can't know too much about boats and the water, especially when you are camping on an island in the middle of a lake,' said Grandpa Martin. 'When you get bigger, Ted and Jan, you'll be able to row a boat all by yourselves.' 'Maybe day after to-morrow,' suggested Jan. 'I wish I could now,' said Ted. 'Oh, but you're too small!' his grandfather said. The boat was tied to the wharf, and then, getting an expressman to go to the depot for the boxes and crates, Mr. Martin took the children with him on the wagon. 'We're having lots of fun!' cried Jan, as the horse trotted along. 'We're camping and we had a ride in a boat and now we're having a ride in a wagon.' 'Lots of fun!' agreed Ted. 'I'm glad we've got grandpa!' 'And grandpa is glad he has you two Curlytops to go camping with him!' laughed the farmer, as the expressman made his horse go faster. At the depot, while the children were waiting to have the boxes and crates of things for the camp loaded into the wagon, Ted saw Arthur Weldon, a boy with whom he sometimes played. 'Hello, Art!' called Ted. 'Hello!' answered Arthur. 'I thought you were camping on Star Island.' 'We are,' answered Teddy. 'It doesn't look so!' laughed Arthur, or 'Art,' as most of his boy friends called him. 'Well, we just came over to get some things. There's grandpa and the expressman with them now,' went on Ted, as the two men came from the freight house with a number of bundles. 'I wish I was camping,' went on the other boy. 'It isn't any fun around here.' 'You can come over to see us sometimes,' invited Jan. 'I'll ask my mother to let you, and you can play with us.' 'He don't want to play girls' games!' cried Ted. 'Well, I guess I can play boys' games as well as girls' games!' exclaimed Janet, with some indignation. 'Oh, yes, course you can,' agreed her brother. 'And maybe Art can bring his sister to the island to see us, and then we could play boys' games and girls', too,' went on Jan. 'I'll ask my mother,' promised Arthur. Grandpa and the expressman soon had the wagon loaded, and Arthur rode back in it with the Curlytops to the wharf where the boat was tied. 'All aboard for Star Island!' cried Mr. Martin, when the things were in the boat, nearly filling it. 'All aboard!' 'I wish I could come now!' sighed Arthur. 'Well, we'd like to take you,' said Grandpa Martin, 'but it wouldn't be a good thing to take you unless your mother knew you were coming with us, and we haven't time to go up to ask her now. The next time maybe we'll take you back with us.' There was a wistful look on Arthur's face as he watched the boat being rowed away from the main shore and toward the island. Ted and Janet waved their hands to him, and said they would ask their mother to invite him for a visit, which they did a few weeks later. Once back on the island the things were taken out of the boat and then began the work of taking them out of the boxes and crates. There was a new oil stove, to warm the tent on cool or rainy days, and other things for the camp, and when all had been unpacked there was quite a pile of boards and sticks left. 'I know what we can do with them,' said Teddy to Janet, when they had been piled in a heap not far from the shore of the lake, and a little distance away from the tents. 'What?' asked the little girl. 'We can make a raft like Robinson Crusoe did,' answered Teddy, for his mother had read him a little about the shipwrecked sailor who, as told in the story book, lived so long alone on an island. 'What's a raft?' asked Janet. 'Oh, it's something like a boat, but it hasn't got any sides to it, only a bottom,' answered her brother. 'You make it out of flat boards and you have to push it along with a pole. We can make a raft out of all the boards and pieces of wood grandpa took the things out of. It'll be a lot of fun!' 'Will mother let us?' asked Jan. 'Oh, I guess so,' answered Teddy. But he did not go to ask to find out. He found a hammer where grandpa had been using it to knock apart the crates and boxes, and, with the help of Jan, Teddy was soon making his raft. There were plenty of nails which had come out of the boxes and crates. Some of them were rather crooked, but when Ted tried to hammer them straight he pounded his fingers. 'That hurts,' he said. 'I guess crooked nails are as good as straight ones. Anyhow this raft is going to be crooked.' And it was very crooked and 'wobboly,' as Janet called it, when Teddy had shoved it into the water and, taking off his shoes and stockings, got on it. 'Come on, Jan!' he cried, 'I'm going to have a ride.' 'No, it's too tippy,' Janet answered. 'Oh, it can't tip over,' said Teddy. 'That's what a raft is for, not to tip over. Maybe you can slide off, but it can't tip over. Come on!' So Janet took off her shoes and stockings. Now of course she ought not to have done that, nor ought Teddy to have got on the raft without asking his mother or his grandfather. But then the Curlytops were no different from other children. So on the raft got Teddy and Janet, and for a time they had lots of fun pushing it around a shallow little cove, not far from the shore of Star Island. A clump of trees hid them from the sight of Mother Martin and grandpa at camp. 'Let's go farther out,' suggested Teddy, after a bit. 'I'm afraid,' replied Janet. 'Aw, it'll be all right!' cried Ted. 'I won't let it tip over!' So Janet let him pole out a little farther, until she saw that the shore was far away, and then she cried: 'I want to go back!' 'All right,' answered Ted. 'I don't want anybody on my raft who's a skeered. I'll go alone!' He poled back to shore and Janet got off the raft. Then Teddy shoved the wabbly mass of boards and sticks, fastened together with crooked nails, out into the lake again. He had not gone very far before something happened. One end of the raft tipped up and the other end dipped down, and, off slid Teddy into the water. 'Oh! Oh!' screamed Janet. 'You'll be drowned! I'm going to tell grandpa.' She ran to the camp with the news, and Mr. and Mrs. Martin came hurrying back. By this time Teddy had managed to get up and was standing in the water, which was not deep. 'I, I'm all right,' he stammered. 'Only I, I'm, wet!' 'I should say you  were !' exclaimed his mother. 'You mustn't go on any more rafts.' Teddy promised that he would not, and then, when he had put on dry clothes, he and Janet played other games that were not so dangerous. They had lots of fun in the camp on Star Island. 'Come on, Jan!' called her brother one morning after breakfast. 'Come on down to the lake.' 'What're you goin' to do?' she asked. 'I think he had better look for the 'g' you dropped,' said Mrs. Martin with a laugh. 'What 'g?'' asked Jan. 'The one off 'going,'' was the answer. 'You must be more careful of your words, Janet dear. Learn to talk nicely, and don't drop your 'g' letters.' She had been trying to teach this to the Curlytops for a long while, and they were almost cured of leaving off the final 'g' of their words. But, once in a while, just as Jan did that time, they forgot. 'What are you going to do?' asked Janet, slowly and carefully this time. 'Sail my boat,' answered Ted. 'I'll give your doll a ride if you want me to.' 'Not this one,' replied his sister, looking at the one she carried. It had on a fine red dress. 'Why not that doll?' Ted inquired. ''Cause your boat might tip over and spill my doll in the lake. Then she'd be spoiled and so would her dress. Wait. I'll get my rubber doll. Water won't hurt her.' 'My boat won't tip over,' Ted declared. 'It's a good one.' But even Jan's rubber doll must have been too heavy for Ted's small boat, for, half way across a little shallow cove in the lake, where the Curlytops waded and Ted sailed his ships, the boat tipped to one side, and the doll was thrown into the water. 'There! I told you so!' cried Janet. 'Well, she's rubber, and you can pretend she has on a bathing suit an' has gone in swimming!' declared Ted. 'But maybe a fish'll bite a hole in her and then she can't whistle through the hole in her back!' wailed Jan, ready to cry. 'There's no fish here, only baby ones; and they can't bite,' Ted answered. 'But I'll get her for you, Jan.' He waded out, set his ship upright again, and brought his sister's doll to shore. Nancy, which was the doll's name, did not seem to have been hurt by falling into the lake. Her painted smile was the same as ever. 'I guess I'll dress her now so she won't get cold after her bath,' said Jan, who sometimes acted as though her dolls were really alive. She liked her playthings very much indeed. While his sister went back to the tent with her doll Ted sailed his boat. Then Trouble came down to the edge of the little cove, and began to take off his shoes and stockings to go wading as Ted was doing. Ted was not sure whether or not his mother wanted Baby William to do this, so he decided to run up to the camp to ask. 'Don't go in the water until I come back, Trouble,' Ted ordered his little brother. But the sight of the cool, sparkling water was too much for Baby William. Off came his shoes and stockings without waiting for Ted to come back to say whether or not Mother Martin would let him go splashing in the water. Into the lake Baby William went. And he was not careful about getting wet, either, so that when Ted came back with his mother, who wanted to make sure that her baby boy was all right, they saw him out in the middle of the cove with Ted's boat. And the water was half way up to Trouble's waist, the lower part of his bloomers being soaked. 'Oh, you dear bunch of Trouble!' cried his mother. 'You mustn't do that!' 'Havin' fun!' was all Trouble said. 'Come here!' cried Mrs. Martin. 'Wait till I sail boat,' and he pushed Ted's toy about in the cove, splashing more water on himself. 'I guess you'll have to get him,' said Mrs. Martin to Teddy, who half dragged, half led his little brother to shore. Trouble got wetter than ever during this, and his mother had to take him back to the tent to put dry things on him. 'Trouble,' she said, 'you are a bad little boy. I'll have to keep you in camp the rest of the day now. After this you must not go in wading until I say you may. If you had had your bathing suit on it would have been all right. Now you must be punished.' Trouble cried and struggled, but it was of no use. When Mother Martin said a thing must be done it was done, and Trouble could not play in the water again that day. Toward the middle of the afternoon, however, as he had been pretty good playing around the tent, he was allowed to roam farther off, though told he must not go near the water. 'You stay with me, Baby,' called Nora. 'I'm going to bake a cake and I'll give you some.' 'Trouble bake a cake, too?' he asked. 'No, Trouble isn't big enough to bake a cake, but you can watch me. I'll get out the flour and sugar and other things, and I'll make a little cake just for you.' On a table in the cooking tent Nora set out the things she was to use for her baking. There was the bag of flour, some water in a dish and other things. Just as she was about to mix the cake Mrs. Martin called Nora away for a moment. 'Now, Trouble, don't touch anything until I come back!' warned the girl, as she hurried out of the tent. 'I won't be gone a minute.' But she was gone longer than that. Left alone in the tent, with many things on the table in front of him, Trouble looked at them. He knew he could have lots of fun with some of the pans, cups, the egg beater, the flour, the water and the eggs. A little smile spread over his tanned, chubby face. 'Trouble bake a cake,' he said to himself. 'Nora bake a cake, Trouble bake a cake. Yes!' First Baby William pulled toward him the bag of flour. He managed to do it without upsetting it, for the bag was a small one. Near it was a bowl of water with a spoon in it. Trouble had seen his mother and Nora bake cakes, and he must have remembered that they mixed the flour and water together. Anyhow that was the way to make mud pies, by mixing sand and water. Trouble looked for something to mix his cake in. The tins and dishes were so far back on the table that he could not get them easily. He must take something else. Off his head Trouble pulled his white hat, a new one that grandpa had brought only that day from the village store. 'Make cake in dis,' murmured Baby William to himself. He pushed a chair up to the table and climbed upon it. From the chair he got on the table and sat down. Then he began to make his cake in his hat. [Illustration: THEN TROUBLE BEGAN TO MAKE A CAKE IN HIS HAT.  Page 138 ] CHAPTER XII THE CURLYTOPS GO SWIMMING 'Trouble make a cake, Trouble make a nice cake for Jan an' Ted,' murmured Baby William to himself. Certainly he thought he was going to do that, make a nice cake, but it did not turn out just that way. Trouble's hat, being of felt, held water just as a dish or a basin would have done, but the little fellow had to hold it very carefully in his lap between his knees as he sat on the table, or he would have squeezed his hat and the water would have spilled out. But when Trouble really wanted to do anything he could be very careful. And he wanted, very much this time, to make that cake. So, when he had the water in his hat he began to dip up some flour from the bag with a large spoon. When the little fellow thought he had enough flour sifted into the water in his hat he began to stir it, just as he had seen Nora stir her cake batter. Around and around he stirred it, and then he found that his cake was much too wet. He had not enough flour in it, just as, sometimes, when he and Jan made mud pies, they did not have enough sand or dirt in the water to make the stuff for the pies as thick as they wanted it. So Trouble stirred in more flour. And then, just as you can easily guess, he made it too thick, and had to put in more water. By this time Trouble's small hat was almost full of flour and water, and some dough began to run over the edges, down on his little bare legs, and also on his rompers and on the table and even to the floor of the kitchen tent. Trouble did not like that. He wanted to get his cake mixed before Nora came back, so she could bake it in the oven for him. For he knew cakes must be baked to make them good to eat, and he really hoped, knowing no better, that his cake would be good enough to eat. 'Trouble make a big cake,' he said, as he slowly put a little more water into his hat, and stirred the dough some more. He splashed some of the flour and water on the end of his stubby nose, and wiped it off on the back of his hand. Then, as he kept on stirring, some more of the dough splashed on his cheeks, and he had to wipe that off. So that, by this time, Baby William had on his hands and face at least as much dough as there was in the spoon. But finally the little mischief-maker got the dough in his hat just about thick enough, not too much flour and not too much water in it. When this point was reached he knew that it was time to get ready for the baking part, putting the dough in the pans so it would go into the oven. Trouble wanted to do as much toward making his own cake as he could without asking Nora to help. So now he thought he could put the dough in the baking pans himself. But they were on the table beyond his reach. He must get up to reach them. So Trouble got up, and then, ,  Well, you can just imagine what happened. He forgot that he was holding in his lap the hat full of dough and as soon as he stood up of course that slipped from his lap and the table and went splashing all over the floor. 'Squee-squish-squash!' the hat full of dough dropped. 'Oh!' exclaimed Trouble. 'Oh!' His feet were covered with the white flour and water. Some splashed on Nora's chair near the table, some splashed on the table legs and more spread over the tent floor and ran in little streams toward the far edges. And, in the midst of it, like a little island in the middle of a lake of dough, was Trouble's new hat. Only now you could hardly tell which was the hat and which was the dough. 'Trouble's cake all gone!' said the little fellow sadly, and just as he said that back came Nora. She gave one look inside her nice, clean tent-kitchen, at least it had been clean when she left it, and then she cried: 'Oh, Trouble Martin! What  have  you gone and done?' 'Trouble make a cake but it spill,' he said slowly, climbing down from the table. 'Spill! I should say it did spill!' cried Nora. 'Oh, what a sight you are! And what will your mother say!' 'What is it now, Nora?' asked Mrs. Martin, who heard the noise in the kitchen. 'Oh, it's Trouble, as you might guess. He's tried to make a cake. But, such a mess!' Mrs. Martin looked in. She wanted to laugh and cry at the same time, but, as that is rather hard to do, she did neither. She just stood and looked at Trouble. He had picked up his hat, which still had a little of the paste in it, and this was now dripping down the front of his rompers. 'Well, it's clean dirt, not like the time he was stuck in the mud of the brook at home, that's one consolation,' said Nora at last. Nora had a good habit of trying to make the best of everything. 'Yes, it's clean dirt and it will wash off,' agreed Mother Martin. 'But, oh, Trouble! You are  such  a sight! And so is Nora's kitchen.' 'Oh, well, I don't mind cleaning up,' said the good-natured maid. 'Come on, Trouble, I'll let your mother wash you and then I'll finish the cake.' 'Make a cake for Trouble?' asked Baby William. 'Yes, I guess I'll have to, since you couldn't make one for yourself,' laughed Nora. 'Never mind, you'll be a man when you grow up and you won't have to mess around a kitchen. Here you are!' and she caught him up, all doughy as he was, and carried him to the big tent where his mother soon had him washed and in clean clothes. Then Nora cleaned up the kitchen and made some real cakes and cookies which Ted and Jan, as well as Trouble, ate a little later. The Curlytops laughed when told of Trouble's attempt to make a cake, and for a long time after that whenever they were telling any of their friends about the queer things their baby brother did, they always told first about the cake he made in his hat one day. 'Oh, Ted, I know what let's do!' cried Janet one day, about a week after Trouble had played with the flour and water. 'What?' asked her brother. 'Go fishing?' 'No, I don't like fishing. Anyhow we went fishing once, and I don't like to see the worms wiggle. Let's make a little play tent for ourselves in the woods.' 'We haven't any cloth.' 'We can make one of leaves and branches, just like the bower we made for Nicknack before grandpa put up the little board barn for him.' 'Yes, we can do that,' agreed Ted. 'It'll be fun. Come on.' A little later the two Curlytops were cutting down branches from low trees, sticking the ends into the soft ground, and tying the leafy tops together with string. This made a sort of tent, and though there were holes in it, where the leaves did not quite come together, it made a shady place. Jan brought in her dolls, and Ted his sailboat and other toys, and there the two children played for some little time. Trouble was not with them. 'But he'll be along pretty soon,' remarked Janet, 'and he'll want part of the tent for his. Is it big enough for three, Teddy?' 'Well, we can make Trouble a little bower for himself right next door. He'll want to bring in a lot of old stones and mud pies anyhow, and we don't want them. We'll make a little bower for him when he comes along.' So, waiting for their little brother to hunt them out, which he always did sooner or later if they went off to play without him, Ted and Jan had fun in the little leafy house they had made for themselves. They were having a good time, and were wondering if Grandpa Martin would ever find the queer ragged man or if they would see the strange blue light again, when Jan suddenly gave a scream. 'What's the matter?' asked Ted. 'Something tickled the back of my neck,' explained his sister. 'Maybe it's a big worm, or a caterpillar! Look, Ted, will you?' Teddy turned to look, but, as he did so, he gave a cry of surprise. 'It's a goat! It's our goat! It's Nicknack!' yelled Teddy. 'He's stuck his head right through the bower and, oh, Jan! he's eating it!' And so Nicknack was. His head was half-way through the side of the tree-tent nearest Jan and the goat was chewing some of the green leaves. It was Nicknack's whiskers that had tickled Jan on the back of her neck. 'Whoa there, Nicknack!' called Ted, as the goat from the outside pushed his way farther into the tent. 'Whoa, there! You'll upset this place in a minute!' And so it seemed Nicknack would do, for he was hungrily eating the leaves of the branches from which Jan and Ted had made their playhouse. 'How'd he get loose?' asked Jan. 'I don't know,' Ted answered. 'I tied him good and tight by his rope. I wonder if, , ' Just then a voice called: 'Wait for me, Nicknack! Wait for me!' 'It's Trouble!' cried Jan and Ted together. Ted looked out through the hole the goat had eaten in the side of the bower, and saw Baby William toddling toward him. 'Did you let Nicknack loose?' demanded Ted. 'Ess, I did,' answered Trouble. 'I cutted his wope with a knife, I did. I wants a wide. Wait for me, Nicknack!' The goat was in no hurry to get away, for he liked to eat the green leaves, and Ted, coming out of the bower, which was almost ready to fall down now that the goat was half-way inside it, saw where the rope, fast around his pet's horns, had been cut. 'You mustn't do that, Trouble,' Ted said to his little brother. 'You mustn't cut Nicknack's rope. He might run away into the lake.' 'Trouble wants a wide.' 'Well, we'll give you a ride,' added Jan. 'But did mother or Nora give you the knife to cut the rope?' 'No. Trouble got knife offen table.' 'Oh, you must  never  do that!' cried Jan. 'You might fall on the sharp knife and cut yourself. Trouble was bad!' The little fellow had really taken a knife from the table, and had sawed away with it on Nicknack's rope until he had cut it through. Then Nicknack had wandered over to the green bower to get something to eat, and Trouble, dropping the knife, had followed. Mrs. Martin, to punish Baby William so he would remember not to take knives again, would not let him have a goat ride, and he cried very hard when Ted and Jan went off without him. But even little boys must learn not to do what is wrong, and Trouble was no different from any others. One afternoon, when the Curlytops had been wandering around the woods of the island, looking to see if any berries were yet ripe, they came back to camp rather tired and warm. 'I know what would be nice for you,' said Nora, who came to the flap doorway of the kitchen tent. 'Yes, I know  two  things that would be nice for you.' 'What?' asked Jan, fanning herself with her sunbonnet. 'I hope it's something good to eat,' sighed Teddy, as he sat down in the shade. 'Part of it,' answered Nora. 'How would you like some cool lemonade, that is, when you are not so warm,' she added quickly, for Teddy had jumped up on hearing this, and was about to make a rush for the kind cook. 'You must always rest a bit, when you are so warm from running, walking or playing, before you take a cold drink of anything.' 'But have you any lemonade?' asked Janet, for she, too, was tired and thirsty. 'I'll make some, and you may have it when you are not so heated,' went on the cook. 'And I'll get some sweet crackers for you.' 'That's nice,' said Janet. 'Are they the two things you were going to tell us to do, Nora?' 'No, I'll count the lemonade and crackers as one,' went on the cook with a smile. 'The other thing I was going to tell you to do is to take Nicknack and have a ride. That will cool you off if you go in the shade.' 'Oh, so it will!' cried Ted. 'We'll do it! And can we take the lemonade in a bottle, and the crackers in a bag, and put them in the goat-wagon?' 'Do you mean to give the crackers and lemonade a ride, too?' asked Mother Martin, who came out of her tent just then. 'No, but we can take them with us, and have a little picnic in the woods,' explained Teddy. 'We didn't find any berries, and so we didn't have any picnic.' 'All right, Nora, give them the lemonade and crackers to take with them,' said Mrs. Martin, smiling at the Curlytops. 'I'll go and make the cool drink now,' said the cook. 'And I'll get the crackers,' said the children's mother. 'And we'll go and get Nicknack and harness him to the cart,' added Ted. He and Janet were soon on their way to the little leafy bower where the goat was kept, for it was so warm on Star Island that the goat did not stay more than half the time in the stable Grandpa Martin had made for him. 'Here, Nicknack! where are you?' called Teddy, as he neared the bower. 'Here, Nicknack!' called Janet. But the goat did not answer. Nearly always, when he was called to in that way, he did, giving a loud 'Baa-a-a-a-a!' that could be heard a long way. 'Oh, Nicknack isn't here!' cried Jan, when she saw the empty place. 'Maybe he's run away, Ted.' 'He must be on the island somewhere,' said the little boy. 'He can't row a boat and get off, and he doesn't like to swim, I guess, though he did fall into the water once.' 'But where is he?' asked Janet. 'We'll look,' Teddy said. So the children peered about in the bushes, but not a sign of Nicknack could they see. They called and called, but the goat did not bleat back to them. 'Oh, where can he be?' asked Janet, and her eyes filled with tears, for she loved the pet animal very much. 'We'll look,' said Teddy. 'And if we can't find him we'll ask grandpa to help us look.' They wandered about, but not going too far from the leafy bower, and, all at once, Ted cried: 'Hark! I hear him!' 'So do I!' added Janet. 'Oh, where is he?' 'Listen!' returned her brother. They both listened, hardly breathing, so as to make as little noise as possible. Once more they heard the cry of the goat: 'Baa-a-a-a-a-a!' went Nicknack. 'Baa-a-a-a!' 'He's over this way!' cried Teddy, and he started to run to the left. 'No, I think he's here,' and Janet pointed to the right. 'What's the matter, Curlytops?' asked Mrs. Martin, who came out just then to see what was keeping the children. 'We can hear Nicknack, but we can't see him,' answered Ted. Mrs. Martin listened to the goat's call. 'I think he's down this path,' she said, and she took one midway between those Ted and Janet would have taken. 'Come along!' she called back to the two children. 'We'll soon find Nicknack.' 'Here, Nicknack! Here, Nicknack!' called Ted. 'Come on, we want you to give us a ride!' added Janet. But though the goat answered, as he nearly always did, his voice sounded afar off, and he did not come running to see his little friends. 'Oh, I wonder if anything is the matter with him?' asked Ted. 'We'll soon see,' said Mrs. Martin. Just then the barking of a dog was heard. 'Oh, I wonder if that's Skyrocket?' asked Janet. 'No, we left our dog home,' said Mrs. Martin. 'That sounds like a strange dog, and he seems to be barking at Nicknack. Come on, children. We'll see what the matter is!' They hurried on, and, in a little while, they saw what had happened. Nicknack was caught in a thick bush by the rope around his horns. He had pulled the rope loose from his leafy bower, and it had dragged along after him as he wandered away. Then the end of the rope had become tangled in a thick bush and the goat could not pull it loose. He was held as tightly as if tied. In front of him, but far enough away so the goat could not butt him with his horns, which Nicknack tried to do, was a big, and not very nice-looking, dog. This dog was barking fiercely at Nicknack, and the goat could not make him go away. 'Oh, Mother! don't let the dog hurt our goat!' begged Janet. 'I'll drive him away,' cried Ted, catching up a stone. 'No, you had better let me do it,' said Mrs. Martin. She picked up a stick and walked toward the dog, but he did not wait for her to get very close. With a last howl and a bark at Nicknack, the dog ran away, jumped into the lake and swam off toward shore. Then the rope was loosed and Nicknack, who was badly frightened, was led back by Ted and Jan and hitched to the wagon. He then gave them a fine ride. The dog was a stray one, which had swum over from the mainland, Grandpa Martin said. Ted and Janet took the lemonade and crackers with them in the goat-wagon and had a nice little picnic in the woods. 'What can we do to-day?' asked Janet, as she and Teddy finished breakfast in the tent one morning, and, after playing about on the beach of the lake, wanted some other fun. 'Let's go swimming!' cried Teddy. 'And take Trouble with us,' added his sister. In their bathing suits and with Nora on the bank to watch them, the children were soon splashing in the cool water. Ted could swim a little bit, and Jan was just learning. 'Come on out where it's a little deeper,' Ted urged his sister. 'It isn't up to your knees here, and you can't swim in such shallow water.' 'I'm afraid to go out,' she said. 'Afraid of what?' 'Big fish or a crab.' 'Pooh! those little crabs won't bite you, and when we splash around we scare away all the fish. They wouldn't bite you anyhow.' 'Maybe a water snake would.' 'No, it wouldn't,' declared Ted. 'Come on and see me swim.' So Jan waded out a little way with him. Ted was just taking a few strokes, really swimming quite well for so small a boy, when, all at once, he heard a cry from his sister. 'Oh, Ted! Ted!' she called. 'Come on in, quick. A big fish is goin' to bite you!' Ted gave one look over his shoulder and saw something with a pointed nose, long whiskers and two bright eyes swimming toward him. 'Oh!' yelled Ted, and he began running for shore as fast as he could splash through the water. CHAPTER XIII JAN'S QUEER RIDE 'What's the matter? What is it?' cried Nora from the bank where she was tossing bits of wood into the lake for Trouble to pretend they were little boats. 'Have you got a cramp, Teddy boy?' 'It's a, a big fish, or, somethin',' he panted, as he kept on running and splashing the water all about, which, after all, did not matter as he was in his bathing suit. 'It's a shark after him!' cried Jan, who, by this time, was safe on shore, stopping on her way to grasp Trouble by the hand and lead him also to safety. 'It's a shark!' She had heard her mother read of bathers in the ocean being sometimes frightened by sharks, or by big fish that looked like sharks. 'Oh, a shark! Good land! We mustn't bathe here any more!' cried Nora. By this time Ted was in such shallow water that it was not much above his ankles. He could see the bottom, and he hoped no very big fish could swim in so little water. So he thought it would be safe to stop and look back. 'Oh, it's coming some more!' cried Jan, from where she stood on the bank with Nora and Trouble. 'Look, Ted! It's coming.' The animal, fish, or whatever it was, indeed seemed to be coming straight for the shore near the place where the Curlytops were playing. Ted, Jan and Nora could see the sharp nose and the bright eyes more plainly now. As for Trouble, he did not know what it was all about, and he wanted to go back in the water to wade, which was as near swimming as he ever came. Then the strange creature turned and suddenly made for a small rock, which stood out of the water a little way from the sandy beach. It climbed out on the rock, while the children and Nora watched eagerly, and then Ted gave a laugh. 'Why!' he exclaimed, 'it's nothing but a big muskrat!' 'A muskrat?' echoed Jan. 'Yes.' 'And see, he has a mussel, or fresh-water clam,' said Nora. 'Look at him crack the shell.' And this is what the muskrat was really doing. It had been swimming in the lake, for muskrats are good swimmers, when it had found a fresh-water mussel, which is like a clam except that it has a longer shell that is black instead of white. Muskrats like mussels, but they cannot eat them in water. They have to bring them up on shore, or to a flat rock or stump that sticks up out of water, where they can crack the shell and eat the mussel inside. 'If I'd a known what it was I wouldn't 'a' been scared,' said Ted, who felt a little ashamed of himself for hurrying toward shore. 'You frightened me yelling so, Jan.' 'Well, I didn't want to see you get bit by a shark, Teddy. First I thought it was a shark.' 'Well, sharks live in the ocean, where the water is salty,' declared Ted. 'Anyhow maybe a muskrat bites,' went on Janet. 'Well, maybe,' agreed Ted. 'I guess it's a good thing I didn't stay there when he came swimming in,' for the big rat passed right over the place where Ted had been about to swim. 'I'm glad you yelled, Janet.' 'So'm I. I'm not going in swimming here any more.' 'Oh, he won't come back,' Ted said. 'Come on!' But Janet would not go, and as it was no fun for Ted to splash in the water all alone he stayed near shore and went wading with Trouble and his sister. This was fun, and the Curlytops had a good time, while Nora, now that she knew there was no danger from sharks, sat in the shade and mended holes in the children's stockings. 'I wish we had a boat,' said Ted after a while. 'Why, we have,' answered Jan. 'Yes, I know, the big rowboat. But that's too heavy for me and you, I mean you and me,' and Ted quickly corrected himself, for he knew it was polite always to name oneself last. 'But I want a little boat that we can paddle around in.' Jan thought for a moment and then cried: 'Oh, I know the very thing!' 'What?' asked Ted eagerly. 'One of the boxes grandpa brought the things in from the store. They're long, and we can make box-boats of them. There's two of 'em!' 'That's what we can!' cried Teddy, as he thought of the boxes his sister meant. Groceries from the store had been sent to the camp in them. The boxes were strong, and long; big enough for Jan or Ted to sit down in them and reach over the sides to paddle, not being too high. Mother Martin said they might take the boxes and make of them the play-boats they wanted, and, in great delight, Ted and his sister ran to get their new playthings. Grandpa Martin pulled out all the nails that might scratch the children, and he also fastened strips of wood over the largest cracks in the boxes. 'That will keep out some of the water, but not all,' he said. 'Your box-boats won't float very long. They'll sink as soon as enough water runs in through the other cracks.' 'Oh, well, we'll paddle in them in shallow water,' promised Ted. 'And sinking won't hurt, 'cause we've got on our bathing suits. Come on, Jan!' Trouble wanted to sail in the new boats, also, but they were not large enough for two. Besides Mrs. Martin did not want the baby to be in the water too much. So she carried him away, Trouble crying and screaming to be allowed to stay, while Jan and Ted got ready for their first trip. They pretended the boats were ocean steamers and that the cove in the lake, near grandpa's camp, was the big ocean. They had pieces of wood which their grandfather had whittled out for them to use as paddles, and, as Ted said, they could sit down in the bottoms of the box-boats and never mind how much water came in, for they still had on their bathing suits. 'All aboard!' called Teddy, as he got into his boat. 'I'm coming,' answered Janet, pushing off from shore. 'Oh, I can really paddle!' cried Ted in delight, as he found that his box floated with him in it and he could send it along by using the board for a paddle, as one does in a canoe. 'Isn't this great, Janet?' 'Oh, it's lots of fun!' 'I'm glad you thought of it. I never would,' went on Ted. He was a good brother, for, whenever his sister did anything unusual like this he always gave her credit for it. Around and around in the little cove paddled the Curlytops, having fun in their box-boats. 'I'm going to let the wind blow me,' said Jan, after a bit. 'I'm tired of paddling.' 'There isn't any wind,' Ted remarked. 'Well, what makes me go along, then!' asked his sister. 'Look, I'm moving and I'm not paddling at all!' She surely was. In her boat she was sailing right across the little cove, and, as Ted had said, there was not enough wind to blow a feather, to say nothing of a heavy box with a little girl in it. 'Isn't it queer!' exclaimed Janet. 'What makes me go this way, Ted? You aren't sailing.' Ted's boat was not moving now, for he had stopped paddling. Still Jan's craft moved on slowly but surely through the water. Then Ted saw a funny thing and gave a cry of surprise. CHAPTER XIV DIGGING FOR GOLD 'What's the matter?' called Jan. Her boat was now quite a little distance away from her brother's. 'Do you see anything, Teddy?' 'I see you are being towed, Janet.' 'Being what?' 'Towed, pulled along, you know, just like the mules pull the canal boats.' Once the Curlytops had visited a cousin who lived in the country near a canal, and they had seen the mules and horses walking along the canal towpath pulling the big boats by a long rope. 'Who's towing me, Ted?' asked Jan, trying to look over the side of her box. But, as she did so it tipped to one side and she was afraid it would upset, so she quickly sat down again. 'I don't know what it is,' her brother answered. 'But something has hold of the rope that's fast to the front part of your box, and it's as tight as anything, the rope is. Something in the water is pulling you along.' On each of the box-boats the Curlytops had fastened a piece of clothes-line their mother had given them. This line was to tie fast their boats to an overhanging tree branch, near the shore of the cove, when they were done playing. And, as Ted had said, the rope fast to the end of Jan's box was stretched out tightly in front, the end being down under water. 'Oh, maybe it's the big muskrat that has hold of my rope and is giving me a ride,' cried Janet. 'It's fun!' 'No, I don't guess it's a rat,' answered Teddy. 'A muskrat wouldn't do that. Oh, I see what it is!' he cried suddenly. 'I see it!' 'What?' asked Janet. Again she got up and tried to look over the side of the box, but once more it tipped as though going to turn over and she sat down. By this time both her box and Ted's was half full of water, and so went only very slowly along the little cove. The weight of the water that had leaked in through the cracks and the weight of the Curlytops themselves made the boxes float low in the lake. 'Can you see what's pulling me?' asked Janet. 'Yes,' answered Teddy, 'I can. It's a great big mud turtle!' 'A mud turtle!' cried Janet. 'I guess he's scared, too,' said her brother, 'for he's swimmin' all around as fast as anything!' 'Where is he?' asked Janet. 'Right in front of your boat. I guess your rope got caught around one of his legs, or on his shell, and he can't get it loose. He must have been swimming along and run into the rope. Or maybe he's got it in his mouth.' 'If he had he could let go,' answered Janet. 'Oh, I see him!' she cried. She had stood up in her box and was looking over the front. The box had now sunk so low in the water that it was on the bottom of the little cove and no longer was the turtle towing it along. The turtle, finding that it could no longer swim, had come to the top of the water and was splashing about, trying to get loose. Jan could see it plainly now, as Ted had seen it before from his boat, which was still floating along, as not so much water had leaked in as had seeped into his sister's. 'Oh, isn't it a big one!' cried Jan. 'It's a big turtle.' 'It surely is!' assented Ted. 'He could bite hard if he got hold of you.' 'Is he biting my rope?' Janet asked. 'No, it's round one of his front legs,' replied Ted. 'There! he's got it loose!' 'There he goes!' shrieked Jan. By this time the mud turtle, which was a very large one, had struggled and squirmed about so hard in the water that he had shaken loose the knot in the end of Jan's rope. The knot had been caught under its left front leg and when the turtle swam or crawled along on the bottom, the rope had been held tightly in place, and so the box was pulled along. But when Jan's boat sank and went aground, the turtle could not pull it any farther, and had to back up, just as Nicknack the goat sometimes backed up his cart. This made the rope slack, or loose, and then the creature could shake the knot of the rope out from under its leg. 'There it goes!' cried Ted, as the turtle swam away. 'Oh, what a whopper! It's bigger than the big muskrat!' 'Your muskrat didn't give you a ride Ted, and my turtle gave me a fine one,' said Jan. 'But I can't sail my boat any more.' 'Well, we'll have to empty out some of the water. Then it will float again and you can get in it.' 'I'm not going to let the rope drag in the water any more,' decided Janet, after Ted had helped her tip her box over so the water would run out. 'I don't really want any more rides like that. The next turtle might go out into the lake. I want to paddle.' 'I wish a big whale would come along and tow me,' laughed Ted. 'I wouldn't let him go loose.' 'He  might  pull you all across the lake,' Janet said. 'I'd like that. Come on, we'll have a race.' 'All right, Ted.' The Curlytops began paddling their box-boats about the cove once more. Ted won the race, being older and stronger than Janet, but she did very well. Then after some more fun sailing about in their floating boxes the children were called by their mother, who said they had been in the water long enough. Besides dinner was ready, and they were hungry for the good things Nora had made. 'And didn't you find any of them, Father?' asked Mrs. Martin as the farmer pushed back his chair, when the meal was over. 'No, I didn't see a sign of them, and I looked all over the cave, too. Some persons have been sleeping in there, for I found a pile of old bags they had used for a bed, but I didn't find anyone.' 'Find who?' Ted inquired. 'The tramps, or the ragged man you and Jan saw,' answered his grandfather. 'I have been looking about the island, but I could not find any of the ragged men, for I think there was more than one. So I guess they've gone, and we needn't think anything more about them.' 'Did you see the blue light?' asked Ted. 'No, I didn't see that, either. I guess it wouldn't show in the daytime. But don't worry. Just have all the fun you can in camp. We can't stay here very much longer.' 'Oh, do we have to go home?' cried the Curlytops, sorrowfully. 'Well, we can't stay here much longer,' said Mother Martin. 'In another month the weather will be too cold for living in a tent. Besides daddy will want us back, and grandpa has to gather in his farm crops for the winter. So have fun while you can.' 'Isn't daddy coming here?' asked Jan. 'Yes, he'll be here next week to stay several days with us. Then he has to go back to the store.' The Curlytops had great fun when Daddy Martin came. They showed him all over the island, the cave, the place where Nicknack nearly ate up the bower-tent, the place where Ted saw the muskrat, and they even wanted him to go riding in the box-boats. 'Oh, I'm afraid I'm too big!' laughed Daddy Martin. 'Besides, I'd be afraid if a mud turtle pulled me along.' 'Oh, Daddy Martin! you would not!' laughed Janet. And so the happy days went by, until Mr. Martin had to leave Star Island to go back to his business. He promised to pay another visit, though, before the camp was ended. Several times, before and after Daddy Martin's visit, Ted and Jan talked about the queer ragged man they had seen, and about the blue light and the cave. 'I wonder if we'll ever find out what it all means,' said Jan. 'It's like a story-book, isn't it, Ted?' 'A little, yes. But grandpa says not to be scared so I'm not.' 'I'm not, either. But what do you s'pose that ragged man is looking for, and who is the professor?' Teddy did not know, and said so. Then, when he and Jan got back to the tent, having been out with Trouble for a ride in the goat-cart, they found good news awaiting them. 'Here is a letter from Hal Chester, the little boy who used to be lame,' said Mrs. Martin, for grandpa had come in, bringing the mail from the mainland post-office. 'Oh, can he come to pay us a visit?' asked Ted. His mother had allowed him to invite Hal. 'Yes, that's what he is going to do,' went on Mrs. Martin. 'His doctor says he is much better, and can walk with hardly a limp now, and the trip here will do him good. So to-morrow Grandpa Martin is going to bring him to Star Island.' 'Oh, goody!' cried Ted and Jan, jumping up and down and clapping their hands. Trouble did the same thing, though he did not know exactly what for. 'We'll have fun with Hal!' cried Ted. 'Maybe he'll help us find the tramp-man. Hal's smart, he can make kites and lots of things.' The next day Hal Chester came to visit the camp on Star Island. 'Say, this is a dandy place!' he exclaimed as he looked about at the tents and at the boat floating in the little cove. 'I'll just love it here!' 'It's awful nice,' agreed Jan. 'And there's a mystery here, too,' added Ted. 'What do you mean?' Hal demanded. 'What's a mystery?' 'Oh, it's something queer,' went on Ted. 'Something you can't tell what it is. This mystery is a tramp.' 'A tramp?' 'Yes. Jan saw him when she was picking flowers, and he pulled Trouble out of the spring afterward. And there's a cave here where maybe he sleeps, 'cause there's some bags for beds in it. He's looking for something on this island, that tramp-man is,' declared Ted. 'Looking for something?' repeated Hal, quite puzzled. 'Yes. He goes all around, and we saw him picking up some stones. Didn't we, Jan?' 'Yes, we did.' 'Picking up stones,' repeated Hal slowly. Then he sprang up from where he was sitting under a tree with the Curlytop children. 'I know what he's looking for!' Hal cried. 'What?' 'Gold!' and Hal's voice changed to a whisper. 'That tramp knows there's gold on this island, and he's trying to dig it up so you won't know it. He's after gold, that's what he is!' 'Oh!' gasped Jan, her eyes shining brightly. 'Oh!' exclaimed Ted. 'Can't we stop him? This is grandpa's island. He mustn't take grandpa's gold.' 'There's only one way to stop him,' said Hal quickly. 'How?' demanded Ted and Janet in the same breath. 'We'll have to dig for the gold ourselves! Come on, let's get some shovels and we'll start right away. It must be up near the cave. Come on! We'll dig for the gold ourselves!' CHAPTER XV THE BIG HOLE Hal Chester was very much in earnest. His eyes shone and he could not keep still. He fairly danced around Janet and Ted. 'Do you really think that tramp-man was looking for gold?' asked Ted. ''Deed I do,' declared Hal. 'What else was he after?' Neither Ted nor Janet could answer that. 'But how will we know where it is?' asked Janet. 'We don't know where there's any gold, and mother won't want us to go near that tramp-man.' 'And I don't want to, either,' answered Hal. 'But we can dig down till we find the gold, can't we?' 'If we knowed, I mean if we knew where to dig,' agreed Ted, after thinking about it. 'But digging for gold isn't like digging for angle-worms to go fishing. You can dig them anywhere. But you've got to have a gold mine to dig for gold.' 'Well, we'll start a mine,' decided Hal. 'That's what the miners do out West. I read about it in a book at the Home when I was crippled and couldn't walk much. The miners just start to dig, and if they don't find gold in one place they dig in another. That's what we'll do. We'll dig till we find the gold, then well have a gold mine.' 'Oh, yes, let's do it!' cried Jan. 'I'd love to have some gold to make a pair of bracelets for my doll.' 'Pooh!' scoffed Ted, 'if we get gold we aren't going to waste it on doll's bracelets! Are we, Hal?' 'Well, if Jan helps us dig she can have her share of the gold. That's what miners always do. They divide up the gold and each one takes his share. Of course Jan can do what she likes with hers.' 'There, see, Mr. Smarty!' cried Jan to her brother. 'I'll make my gold into doll's bracelets.' 'Maybe you won't get any,' objected Ted. 'Well, I'll help you dig, anyhow. I helped grandpa dig trenches around the tents so the rain water would run off, and I can help dig a gold mine. I know where the shovels are.' 'Good!' cried Hal. 'We don't want any girls in this gold mine!' objected Ted, as his sister hurried off to where Grandpa Martin kept the shovels, hoes and other garden tools he used about the camp. Usually Ted did not mind what game his sister played with him, but since Hal had spoken of gold the little Curlytop boy had acted differently. 'We don't want girls in the gold mine,' repeated Ted. 'Course we do!' laughed Hal. 'Jan's a strong digger, and I can't do very much, as my foot that used to be lame isn't all well yet. It used to be almost as strong as the other, but now it isn't. So you and Jan will have to do most of the digging, though I can shovel away the dirt. Anyhow they always have girls or women in gold camps, you know.' 'They do?' cried Ted. 'Of course! They do the cooking where there aren't any Chinamen. Mostly Chinamen do the cooking in gold camps, but we haven't any, so we'll have to have a girl. She can be Jan.' 'There's a Chinaman who washes shirts and collars in our town,' remarked Ted. 'Maybe we could get him to cook for us.' 'No! What's the use when we've got Jan? Anyhow it'll be only make-believe cooking, and I don't guess that shirt-Chinaman would want to come here just for that. Anyhow we'd have to pay him and we haven't any money.' 'We'll get some out of the gold mine,' Ted answered. 'Well, maybe we won't find any gold for a week or so.' 'Does it take as long as that?' 'Oh, yes. Sometimes longer. And that Chinaman would want to be paid for his cooking every week, or every night maybe. We won't have to pay Jan.' 'That's so. Well, then I guess she can come. But we can get my mother or Nora to make us sandwiches and we won't have to cook much of anything.' 'That's what I thought, Teddy. But we can let Jan set the table and things like that when she isn't digging. She'll help a lot.' 'Yes, she's almost as strong as I am,' agreed Ted. 'Hurry up, Jan!' he called. 'Got those shovels yet?' 'Yes, but I can't carry 'em all. You must help. Come on!' Jan was walking back toward the boys, dragging two heavy shovels. Seeing this, Hal hurried to help her and Ted followed. They got another shovel and a hoe and with these they started off toward the cave, about which Ted had told Hal. 'That'll be the place where the gold is,' decided the visitor. 'The tramps must have been looking for it there. We'll start our gold mine right near the cave.' 'What about something to eat?' asked Ted, pausing as they started up the path that led to the hole out of which the cave opened. 'That's so. We ought to have something. I'm getting hungry now,' remarked Jan, though it was not long since they had had a meal. 'So'm I,' announced Ted. 'Better not stop to go back for anything to eat now,' decided Hal. 'Your mother or grandma might make us stay in camp. Did you tell them we were going to dig for gold, Jan?' 'No. I didn't see any of them when I got the shovels.' 'Well then, we'll go on up to the cave. One of us can come back later and get something to eat. They call it 'grub' in the books.' 'Call what grub?' Ted asked. 'Stuff the miners eat. We'll send Jan back for the grub after we start the gold mine. You're going to be the cook,' Hal informed Ted's sister. 'I am not!' she cried, dropping her shovel. 'I'm going to be a gold miner just like you two. If I can't be that I won't play, and I'll take my shovel right back! So there now!' 'Oh, you can be a gold miner too,' Hal made haste to say. 'But we've got to have a cook, they always do in a gold camp.' 'Well, I'll be a cook when I'm not digging gold,' agreed Jan. 'But I want to get enough for my doll's bracelets.' 'That's all right,' agreed Hal. It would not do to have Jan leave them right at the start. If Mrs. Martin or grandpa saw the children starting out with hoe and shovels they probably thought the Curlytops were only going to dig fish worms, as they often did. Grandpa Martin was very fond of fishing, but he did not like to dig the bait. But Trouble was fretful that day, and his mother had to take care of him, so she did not pay much attention to Jan or Ted, feeling sure they would come to no harm. So on the three children hurried toward the hole into which Ted had fallen just before they found the queer cave. 'This is just the place for a gold mine!' cried Hal when he looked at the ground around the big hole. 'I guess some one must have started a mine here once before.' 'It does look so,' agreed Ted. 'Let's go into the cave,' proposed the visitor. 'No, grandpa told us we must never go in without him,' objected Jan. 'It's all right to stay outside here and dig, but we mustn't go inside. The tramps might be in there.' 'That's right,' chimed in Ted. 'Well stay outside.' Hal was not very anxious, himself, to go into the dark hole, so they looked at the place where Ted had fallen through the loose leaves and talked about whether it would be better to start to make that hole larger or begin a new one. The children decided the last would be the best thing to do. 'We'll start a new mine of our own,' said Hal. 'I guess maybe somebody dug there and couldn't find any gold. So we'll start a new mine.' This suited the Curlytops and they soon began making the dirt fly with shovels and hoe, digging a hole that was large enough for all three of them to stand in. Hal said they didn't want to start by making too small a mine. 'If we've got to divide it into three parts we want each one's part big enough to see,' he said, and Ted and Jan agreed to this. The ground was of sand and very easy to dig. There were no big rocks, only a few small stones, and of course this was just what the children liked. So that in about half an hour they had really dug quite a deep hole. It was almost as easy digging as it is in the sand at the seashore, and if any of you have been there you know how soon, even if you use only a big clam shell for a shovel, you can make a hole deep enough for you and your playmates to stand up in. 'Do you see any gold yet?' asked Jan of the two boys, when they had dug down so that only the top parts of their bodies were out of the big hole. 'No, not yet. But we'll come to it pretty soon,' Hal said. 'Say, how're we going to get up when the hole gets too deep?' asked Ted. 'We ought to have a ladder or something.' 'There's a ladder in camp,' answered Jan. 'Grandpa had it when he put up our real rope swing. Don't you remember, Ted?' 'Yes, that's right. We'd better get it if we're going any deeper, Hal,' he added. 'Course we're going deeper. Gold mines are real deep. I guess the ladder would be a good thing.' 'Then we'll go for it. Jan, you can come and get us something to eat, too. I'm awful hungry.' 'So'm I,' said Hal. While Jan was in the tent-kitchen begging Nora for some cookies and sandwiches, Ted and Hal carried the small ladder, which was not very heavy, up to the big hole they had started. By putting one end of the ladder down inside, allowing it to slant up to the top of the hole, the children could easily get down in and climb up. After they had eaten the things Jan got from Nora, they began digging again. The hole was soon so deep that the dirt which was shoveled and hoed away from the bottom and sides could no longer be tossed out by Ted and Jan. 'We've got to get a pail and hoist up the dirt,' decided Hal. 'That's what they do in gold mines. One of us must stay at the bottom and dig the dirt and fill the pail, and the other pull it up by a rope.' 'We'll take turns,' said Teddy. 'And I want to help, too!' cried Jan, so the boys agreed to let her, especially as they had seen that she could dig and toss dirt almost as well as they could. They found an old pail and part of a clothes-line for the rope, and the work at the 'gold mine,' as they called it, went on more merrily than before. By this time the hole was really quite deep, so deep that Hal Chester could not see over the rim when he stood up straight on the bottom, and only by using the ladder could the children get down and up. 'We ought to find gold pretty soon now,' said Hal, as he climbed up to let Ted take a turn at going down in the hole and digging. Just then from the camp they heard the sound of the supper bell. 'Come on!' called Ted, not waiting to go down into the big hole. 'We can dig some more after supper and to-morrow. I'm hungry!' 'So'm I,' agreed Hal. Leaving their shovels and the hoe on the pile of dirt, the children hastened down to the tent where Nora had supper waiting for them, and it had a most delicious smell. 'Where have you children been?' asked Mrs. Martin. 'Oh, havin' fun,' answered Ted. 'Don't forget your 'g,' Curlytop,' warned his mother with a laugh. 'Are you hungry, Hal?' 'Indeed I am! This island is a good place for getting hungry.' 'And this is a good place to be stopped from getting hungry,' laughed Grandpa Martin, as he pulled his chair up to the well-filled table near which Nora stood ready to serve the meal. The Curlytops and Hal had just a little idea that the grown folks would not like their plan of digging a gold mine, so nothing was said about it. Hal, Ted and Jan looked at one another when their plates were emptied, and then all three of them started once more back toward the big hole. 'Where are you going?' asked Mother Martin. 'We, , ' began Jan, then stopped. 'Oh, we, we're playing a game,' answered Ted. It was a sort of game. 'Can't you take Trouble with you? You haven't looked after him to-day,' went on Mrs. Martin, 'and I want to help Nora. Take Trouble with you.' 'All right,' agreed Ted, though he thought perhaps Baby William might be in the way at the gold mine. 'Where is he?' asked Jan. They looked around for the little fellow. He was not in sight. 'He got down from the table and was playing over there on the path a while ago,' said Grandpa Martin, and he pointed toward the path that led to the gold mine. But Trouble was not in sight now. 'He must have wandered off into the woods,' said his mother. 'I've kept him close by me all day, and he didn't like it. Trouble! William!' she called aloud. 'Where are you?' Ted and Jan looked at one another. Hal seemed startled. The same thought came to all three of them: 'Suppose Trouble had fallen down the big hole at the gold mine?' CHAPTER XVI A GLAD SURPRISE Janet, Ted and Hal started to run. 'Where are you going?' called Mrs. Martin after them. 'Wait for Trouble!' 'We're going to find him,' answered Janet. 'Maybe he fell down the big hole we dug for a gold mine,' added Ted. 'What do you mean?' gasped Mrs. Martin. 'What have you Curlytops been up to now?' asked Grandpa Martin. 'We dug a big hole to find the gold the tramps are looking for on this island,' explained Hal, who walked on slowly, following Mrs. Martin, who had run after Ted and Janet. 'Maybe the little boy fell into it.' 'Where did you dig the big hole?' asked grandpa, and he, too, began to be afraid that something had happened. 'Up near what Ted calls the cave. It's got a ladder in it, our gold mine hole has, and maybe Trouble could climb out on that.' 'If it's a hole deep enough for a ladder, I'm afraid he couldn't,' said Grandpa Martin. 'You children must have dug a pretty big hole.' 'We wanted to find the gold,' explained Hal. 'What gold?' 'The gold the tramps are looking for here on Star Island. Ted told me about them, and I suppose they were after gold. We want to find it first.' 'There isn't any gold here, and you mustn't dig holes so deep that Trouble, or anyone else, would wander off and fall into them,' said Mr. Martin. 'However, I presume it will be all right. But we must hurry there and find out what has happened.' He and Hal hastened on, following Mrs. Martin and the Curlytops, who were now out of sight around a turn in the path that led to the big hole. Hal was rather frightened, for he knew it was his idea, more than the plans of Jan and Ted, that had caused the 'gold mine' to be dug. On and on, along the path and up the hill hurried grandpa and Mrs. Martin and the children. They called aloud for Trouble, but he did not answer. At least they could not hear him if he did. He must have gone quietly away from the table when no one noticed him. He had had his supper before the Curlytops and Hal came from their digging. 'There's the pile of dirt,' called back Ted, who was running on ahead. He pointed to the mound of yellow sand that he, Hal and Jan had dug out of the hole. 'And some one is there, digging!' cried Jan. 'Oh, maybe it's Trouble!' 'I only hope he hasn't fallen in and hurt himself!' murmured Mrs. Martin. By this time Grandpa Martin and Hal had caught up to the others. They could all see some one making the dirt fly on top of the yellow mound of sand at one side of the big hole. As Ted came nearer he saw a man on top of the dirt, using a shovel. The man was digging quickly, and at first Teddy thought it was one of the tramps. But a second look showed him he was wrong. And then came a glad surprise, for the man called: 'I'll have him out in a minute. He isn't under very deep!' 'Why it's the lollypop man!' cried Jan. And so it was, Mr. Sander, the jolly, fat man who sold waffles and lollypops. 'Is Trouble in the hole? Are you digging him out?' gasped Mrs. Martin, and she felt as though she were going to faint, she said afterward. 'No! Trouble isn't here, I mean he isn't in the hole!' cried Mr. Sander. 'It's your goat, Nicknack, who's buried under the sand. But his nose is sticking out so he won't smother, and I'll soon have him all the way out.' 'But where is Trouble?' cried Baby William's mother. 'There he is, safe and sound, tied to a tree so he can't get in the way of the dirt I'm shoveling out. I didn't want to throw sand in his eyes!' cried the lollypop man. 'Trouble is all right!' And so the little fellow was, though he had been crying, perhaps from fright, and his face was tear-streaked and dirty. But he was safe. With a glad cry his mother loosed the rope by which Mr. Sander had carefully tied Trouble to a near-by tree and gathered him up in her arms. Meanwhile Grandpa Martin caught up one of the shovels and began to help the lollypop man dig in the sand. The Curlytops and Hal saw what had happened. A lot of the dirt they had shoveled out had slid back into the big hole, almost filling it. And caught under this dirt was Nicknack, their goat. Only the black tip of his nose stuck out, and it is a good thing this much of him was uncovered, or he might have smothered under the sand. 'How did it happen?' asked Ted. 'There must have been a cave-in at our gold mine,' said Hal. 'But how did Nicknack get here?' Ted went on. 'I guess Trouble must have untied him and brought him here,' suggested Janet. Then they all watched while Grandpa Martin and the lollypop man dug out the goat. 'Baa-a-a-a-a!' bleated Nicknack as he scrambled out after most of the sand had been shoveled off his back. 'Baa-a-a-a!' 'My! I guess he's glad to get out!' cried Ted. 'I guess so!' agreed the lollypop man. 'I got here just as the dirt caved in on him, and I began to dig as soon as I tied Trouble out of the way so he'd be safe.' 'But how did you come to be here?' asked Grandpa Martin. 'And how did our goat get here?' asked Janet. 'I saw Trouble leading him along by the strap on his horns,' explained Mr. Sander. 'I guess he must have taken him out of his stable when you folks weren't looking. Trouble led the goat up on top of the pile of sand near the hole. I called to him to be careful. 'Just as I did so the sand slid down and I saw the goat go down into the hole. Baby William fell down, but he didn't slide in with the dirt. Then I ran and picked him up, and I tied him to the tree with a piece of rope I found fast to a pail. I thought that was the best way to keep him out of danger while I dug out the goat.' 'I guess it was,' said Grandpa Martin. 'Poor Trouble cried when I tied him fast, but I knew crying wouldn't hurt him, and falling under a lot of sand might. I dug as fast as I could, for I knew how you Curlytops loved your goat. He's all right, I guess.' And Nicknack was none the worse for having been buried under the sliding sand. As they learned afterward Trouble had slipped off to have some fun by himself with the pet animal. Baby William had, somehow, found his way to the 'gold mine,' and pretending the pile of sand was a mountain had led Nicknack up it. Then had come the slide down into the big hole which Hal and the Curlytops had dug. If it had not been for Mr. Sander appearing when he did, poor Nicknack might have died. 'But, Trouble. You must never, never, never go away again alone with Nicknack!' warned Mother Martin. 'Never! Do you hear?' 'Me won't!' promised the little fellow. 'And you children mustn't dig any more deep holes,' said Grandpa Martin. 'There isn't any gold on this island, so don't look for it.' 'But what are the tramps looking for?' Ted asked. 'I can't tell you. But, no matter about that, don't dig any more deep holes. They're dangerous!' 'We won't!' promised the Curlytops and Hal. 'How did you come to pay a visit to Star Island, Mr. Sander?' asked the children's mother. 'Well, I'm stopping for the night on the main shore just across from here,' was the answer, 'so, having had my supper and having made my bed in my red wagon, I thought I'd come over and pay you a visit. I heard you were camping here, so I borrowed a boat and rowed over. I walked along this path, and I happened to see Trouble and the goat. Then I knew I had found the right place, but I did not imagine I'd have to come to the rescue of my friend Nicknack,' and with a laugh he patted the shaggy coat of the animal, that rubbed up against the kind lollypop man. 'Well, come back to the tent and visit a while,' was Grandpa Martin's invitation. 'We're ever so much obliged to you.' 'What does all this mean about tramps and a gold mine?' asked Mr. Sander. 'If there's gold to be had in an easier way than by selling hot waffles from a red wagon with a white horse to pull it, I'd like to know about it,' he added with a jolly laugh. 'Oh, ho! Oh, ho!' he cried. 'Hot waffles do I sell. Hot waffles I love well!' 'Did you bring any with you?' asked Ted eagerly. 'Indeed I did, my little Curlytop. They may not be hot now, but maybe your mother can warm them on the stove,' and picking up a package he had laid down near the tree to which he had tied Trouble, the lollypop man gave it to Mrs. Martin with a low bow. 'Waffles for the Curlytops,' he said laughing. CHAPTER XVII TROUBLE'S PLAYHOUSE Safe once more in their camp, the children ate the waffles which Nora made nice and crisp again over the fire. Trouble was comforted and made happy by two of the sugar-covered cakes, and then everyone told his or her share in what had just happened. 'So you think there are gold-hunting tramps here?' asked the lollypop man, just before he got ready to go back to the mainland where he had left his red wagon and white horse. 'Well, there are ragged men here, tramps I suppose you could call them,' answered Grandpa Martin. 'But I don't know anything about gold. That's one of Hal's ideas.' 'I couldn't think of anything else they'd be looking for,' explained Ted's friend. 'Don't you think it might be gold, Mr. Martin?' 'Hardly, on this island. Anyhow we haven't seen the ragged men lately, so they may have gone. Perhaps they were only stray fishermen. We would like to thank one for having pulled Trouble out of the spring, only we haven't had the chance.' 'No. He ran away without stopping for thanks,' said Baby William's mother. 'He must be a kind man, even if he is a tramp.' After a little more talk while they were seated about the campfire Grandpa Martin built in front of the tents, during which time the lollypop man told of his travels since he had helped sell the cherries for the chewing candy, Mr. Sander rowed back to the main shore to sleep in his red wagon, which was like a little house on wheels. 'Come again!' invited Mrs. Martin. 'I will when any more goats fall into gold mines,' he promised with a laugh. The next day Grandpa Martin filled up the hole Ted, Jan and Hal had dug, thus making sure that neither Trouble nor anyone else, not even Nicknack the goat, would again fall down into it. For when the sand slid into the 'gold mine,' carrying the goat with it, the hole was not altogether filled. Then Grandpa Martin brought away the hoe and shovels, and told the children they must play at some other game. 'Where are you going now?' called Mrs. Martin to the two Curlytops, as they started away from camp one morning. Hal stayed in the tent, as he was tired. 'Oh, we're just going for a walk,' answered Teddy. 'We want to have some fun,' added his sister. 'Well, don't go digging any more gold mines,' warned Grandpa Martin, with a laugh. 'All the fun of camping will be spoiled if you get into that sort of trouble again.' 'We won't,' promised Janet, and Teddy nodded his head to show that he, too, would at least try to be good. It was not that the Curlytops were bad, that is, any worse than perhaps you children are sometimes, or, perhaps, some boys or girls you know of. They were just playful and full of life, and wanted to be doing something all the while. 'Do you want to take Trouble with you?' asked Mrs. Martin, as Ted and Janet started away from camp, and down a woodland path. 'Yes, we'll take him,' said Janet. 'Come on, little brother,' she went on. 'Come with sister and have some fun.' 'Only I can't play in de dirt 'cause I got on a clean apron,' said Baby William. 'No, we won't let you play in the dirt,' Teddy remarked. 'But don't fall down, either. That's where he gets so dirty,' Teddy told his mother. 'He's always falling down, Trouble is.' 'It, it's so, s'ippery in de woods!' said the little fellow. 'So it is, on the pine needles,' laughed Grandpa Martin, who was going to the mainland in the boat. But this time he did not want to take the children with him. 'It is slippery in the woods, Trouble, my boy. But keep tight hold of Jan's hand, and maybe you won't fall down.' 'Me will,' said Trouble, but he did not mean that he would fall down. He meant he would keep tight hold of Jan's hand. Then he started off by her side, with Ted walking on ahead, ready for anything he might see that would make fun for him and his sister. Through the woods they wandered, now and then stopping to gather some pretty flowers, on graceful, green ferns, and again waiting to listen to the song of some wild bird, which flitted about from branch to branch, but which seemed always to keep out of sight amid the leaves of the forest trees. 'Oh, isn't it just lovely here!' said Janet, as they came to a little grassy dell, around which the trees grew in a sort of circle, or magic, fairy ring. 'It's just like in a picture book, Teddy!' 'Yes, it is,' agreed her brother. 'I don't see any pisshures,' complained Trouble. 'No, there aren't  real  pictures here,' explained Janet; 'only make-believe ones. But you can sit down on the grass and roll, Trouble. The grass is so clean I guess it won't make your apron dirty. Roll on the grass.' Trouble liked nothing better than this, and he was soon sitting on the soft, green grass, pulling bits and tossing them in the air like a shower. The grass was soft and thick, and did not soil his clean clothes at all. 'Exceptin' maybe a little stain,' explained Janet to Teddy; 'and Nora can get that out in the wash.' After they had sat in the shade for a while, in the green, grassy place, Ted and Janet wandered off among the trees, leaving Trouble by himself. But they were not going far. 'He'll be all right for a little while,' said Teddy, 'and maybe we can find some sassafras or wintergreen.' 'But we mustn't eat anything we find in the woods, lessen we show it to grandpa or mother,' returned Janet. 'No, that's so,' agreed her brother. They had been told, as all children should be who live near the woods or fields, never to eat any strange berries or plants unless some older person tells them it is all right to do so. But Teddy and Janet could easily tell sassafras and wintergreen by the pleasant smell of the leaves. They did not find any, however. They found a bird's empty nest, though, with broken egg shells in it, showing that the little birds had been hatched out and had flown away. All at once, as the Curlytops were wondering what else they could do, they heard Trouble calling, and his voice sounded very strange. 'Oh, what has happened to him now?' cried Janet. 'We'd better go to see!' exclaimed Teddy. They ran back to where they had left their little brother. All they could see of him was his back and legs. He did not seem to have any head. 'Oh! Oh!' gasped Janet. 'Where is Trouble's head?' Ted did not know, and said so, and then the little fellow cried: 'Tum an' det me out! Tum an' det me out!' Then Janet saw what had happened. Trouble had thrust his head between the crotch, or the Y-shaped part, of a tree, and had become so tightly wedged that he could not get out. 'Oh, what shall we do?' cried Janet. 'I'll show you,' answered Teddy. 'You can help me.' Then he pushed on the little boy's head, and Janet pulled, and he was soon free again, a little scratched about the neck, and frightened, but not hurt. 'You must never do such a thing again,' said Mrs. Martin, when the children reached camp and told her what had happened. 'No, we won't do it any more,' promised Trouble, feeling of his neck, where he had thrust it between the parts of the tree. 'And you mustn't go off again, and leave him by himself,' said their mother to the Curlytops. 'There is no telling what he'll do.' 'That's right,' said Grandpa Martin with a laugh. 'You may go away, leaving Trouble standing on his feet, but when you come back he's standing on his head. Oh, you're a great bunch of trouble!' and he caught the little fellow up in his arms and kissed him. For several days Teddy and Janet and Hal had many good times on Star Island. Then they wanted something new for amusement. 'Let's make a trap and catch something,' said Ted, after he and Jan had spoken of several ways of having fun. 'How can you make a trap?' Hal asked. 'I'll show you,' offered Ted. 'You just take a box, turn it upside down, and raise one end by putting a stick under it. Then you tie a string to the stick, and when you pull the string the stick is yanked out and the box falls down and you catch something.' 'What do you catch?' Hal asked. 'Oh, birds, or an animal, maybe a fox or a muskrat, whatever goes under the box when it's raised up.' 'But what makes them go under?' Hal inquired. 'To get something to eat. You see you put some bait under the box, some crumbs for birds or pieces of meat for a fox or a muskrat. Then you hide in the bushes, with the end of the string in your hand and when you see anything right under the box you pull it and catch 'em!' 'Oh, but doesn't it hurt them?' asked Hal, who had a very kind heart. 'Maybe it might, Ted,' put in Jan. 'No. It doesn't hurt 'em a bit,' declared Ted. 'They just stay under the box, you know, like in a cage.' 'I wouldn't like to catch a bird,' said Hal softly. 'You see the birds are friends of Princess Blue Eyes. She wouldn't like to have them caught.' 'Oh, well, we could let them go again,' Ted decided, after a little thought. 'Does Princess Blue Eyes like foxes and muskrats too?' Jan asked softly. 'I guess she likes everything, birds, animals and flowers. Anyway I make-believe she does,' and Hal smiled. 'Of course she's only a pretend-person, but I like to think she's real. I like to dream of her.' 'I would, too,' said Janet softly. 'We mustn't catch any birds, Ted, nor animals, either.' 'Not if we let them go right off quick?' Ted asked. 'No,' and Janet shook her head. 'It might scare 'em you know. And the box might fall on their legs, or their wings, if it's a bird, and hurt them.' 'Well, then, we won't do it!' decided Ted. 'I wouldn't want to hurt anything, and I wouldn't want to make your friend, Princess Blue Eyes, feel bad,' he added to Hal. He remembered the story Hal had told about the make-believe Princess, when they sat in the green meadow studded with yellow buttercups and white daisies. 'Let's play store!' suggested Jan. 'There's lots of pretty stones and shells on the shore, and we can use them for money.' 'What'll we sell?' asked Hal. 'Oh, we can sell other stones, big ones, for bread, and sand for sugar and leaves for cookies and things like that,' Janet proposed. 'I wish we had something real to eat, and then we could sell that and it would be some good,' remarked Ted. 'I'm going to ask Nora.' 'Oh, that'll be fun!' cried Jan. 'Come on, Hal. We'll get the store ready and Ted can go in and ask Nora for some real cookies and maybe a piece of cake.' Nora, good-natured as she always was, gave Ted a nice lot of broken cookies, some crackers and some lumps of sugar so the children could play store and really eat the things they sold. Hal gathered some mussel shells and colored stones on the shore of the lake, and these were money. The store counter was made by putting a board across two boxes and they took turns being the storekeeper. Trouble wanted to play, too. But he only wanted to buy bits of molasses cookies, and he ate the pieces as fast as he got them, without pretending to go out of the store to take them home. 'Me buy more tookie!' he would say, swallowing the last crumb and hurrying up to the board counter with another 'penny,' which was a shell or a stone. 'You mustn't eat them up so fast, Trouble,' said Janet. 'Else we won't have any left to play store with.' 'Oh, well, we can get more from Nora,' said Ted. 'And the cookies taste awful good.' They played store until there were no more good things left to eat and Nora would not hand out any others from her boxes and pans in the kitchen tent. Then the Curlytops and Hal got in the rowboat and paddled about in the shallow cove. Trouble did not go with them, his mother saying he must have a little sleep so he would not be so cross in the afternoon. And when Jan, her brother and Hal came up from the lake they found the little fellow making what he called a 'playhouse.' 'Oh, what funny stones Trouble has!' cried Ted as he saw them. 'They're blue.' 'They're pretty,' decided Janet. 'Where'd you get them, Trouble?' 'Over dere,' and he pointed to a spot some distance from the camp. 'He found them himself and brought them here in his apron,' said Mrs. Martin. 'He's been piling them up into what I called a castle, but he says it's a playhouse. He's been very good playing with the blue stones.' 'Let's get some too, and see who can build the biggest castle!' cried Janet. 'Show us where you got them, Trouble.' But when Baby William toddled to the place where he had picked up the blue stones there were no more. He had gathered them all, it seemed, and now would not let his brother or sister take any from his pile. However they found other stones which did as well, though they were not blue in color, and soon the Curlytops and Hal, as well as Trouble, were making a little house of stones. 'This is more fun than playing store!' cried Janet, as she made a little round tower as part of her castle. 'Are you making a palace for Princess Blue Eyes, Hal?' asked Ted. 'Yes,' he answered, for his stone castle was rather a large one. 'But I can't be sure she'll like it. She doesn't want to stay in one place very long. She's like a firefly, always dancing about.' And so they pretended and played, having a very good time, while Mother Martin watched them and smiled. The children were having great fun camping with grandpa. The castles finished, Trouble's being the prettiest because of the blue stones, though not as large or fancy as the others, the Curlytops, Hal and Baby William went on a little picnic in the woods that afternoon, taking Nicknack with them. Or rather, the goat took them, for he pulled them in the cart along the forest path. When Jan, Hal and Ted were eating breakfast the next morning they heard a cry from Trouble, who had toddled out of the tent as soon as he had finished his meal. 'Oh, what has happened to him now?' exclaimed Mother Martin. 'Run and see, Jan, dear, that's a good girl!' Janet found her little brother at the place where they had made the castles the night before. Trouble's eyes were filled with tears. 'My p'ayhouse all gone!' he cried. 'Trouble's house all goned away!' It was true. Not a trace of his playhouse was left! In the night someone or something had taken the blue stones away. CHAPTER XVIII IN THE CAVE Trouble felt very bad about his playhouse of blue stones which had been taken away. He was only a little fellow, and when he had gone to so much work, building up what looked like a fairy castle, he surely thought he would find it where he left it at night to have it to play with the next morning. But it was gone. 'All goned,' sobbed Trouble. 'Isn't it funny, though?' said Teddy. 'Mine is all right, and so is yours, Jan, and Hal's, too. They just spoiled Trouble's.' 'Maybe it was Nicknack,' suggested Jan. 'He might have got loose in the night and knocked it down. But he didn't mean to I guess, for he's a good goat.' 'It couldn't have been Nicknack,' declared Hal. 'Why not?' asked Ted. 'Didn't he fall down into the big hole when Trouble led him to it?' 'Yes, but Nicknack is there in his stable. He isn't loose at all, and he'd have to be loose to come here and knock over Trouble's playhouse. The goat is tied fast just where he was last night.' So Nicknack was; and Grandpa Martin, who was the first one up in the camp that morning, said the goat was lying quietly down in his stable when he went to give him a drink of water. So it couldn't have been Nicknack. 'Anyhow, Trouble's blue-stone castle wasn't just knocked down,' went on Hal, 'it's gone, every stone is gone. Somebody took 'em!' Jan and Ted noticed this for the first time. When Trouble had called out that his playhouse was gone they had thought he meant it was just knocked over. But, instead, it was gone completely. Not a blue stone was left. And, strangely enough, none of the other three castles was touched. Hal had built quite a large one, but not a stone had been taken from it. 'Where my p'ayhouse?' asked Trouble, looking all about. 'I want my p'ayhouse.' 'We'll find it for you,' promised Jan, though she did not know how she was going to do it. Perhaps Hal could think of a way. Hal was older than Jan and Ted. 'What's the matter, Curlytops?' asked Mother Martin as she came out of the tent. 'Has anything happened? Why is Trouble crying? Did he get hurt?' 'No, but someone took away his nice blue stone castle,' explained Jan, and she and the others took turns telling what had happened. 'It is queer,' said Grandpa Martin, when he came up and heard what had taken place. 'I wonder if any of those, , ' Then he stopped talking and looked at the children's mother in a queer way. She nodded her head, glanced down at the Curlytops and Hal, and put her finger across her lips as your teacher does in school when she wants someone to stop whispering. Hal saw what Mrs. Martin did, but neither Jan nor Ted noticed, for they were running around looking for any of the blue stones that might have been scattered from Trouble's playhouse. 'Never mind,' said Mother Martin. 'I'll find you something else to play with, Trouble. You shall have a nice ride with Nicknack. You'll take him, won't you, Jan and Ted?' 'Yes,' they answered. 'I want my p'ayhouse!' sobbed Baby William, and for a time he made a fuss about his missing blue stones. 'I guess I know what happened to them,' said Hal in a whisper to Jan and Ted when their mother had taken Trouble into the tent to find something with which to amuse him. 'What?' asked Ted in a whisper. 'The tramps!' exclaimed Hal, looking over his shoulder to make sure no one but his two little friends heard him. 'That's what your grandfather was going to say the time he stopped so quick. Your mother didn't want him to speak of them. But I'm sure the tramps took the blue stones from Trouble's castle.' 'What would they do with 'em?' Ted demanded. 'There's gold in 'em!' whispered Hal, more excited than ever now. 'There's gold in those blue stones, and the tramps know it. That's what they've been looking for, and when Trouble had 'em all in a nice pile made into a playhouse, the tramps came along in the night and took 'em away.' 'Oh, do you s'pose it could happen that way, really?' asked Jan, her eyes big with wonder. 'Course it could!' said Hal, growing more excited all the while. 'I remember now, gold doesn't always look yellow when you find it, the way it does in a watch or a ring. Sometimes gold is inside stones and they have to melt 'em in the fire to get the gold out. My nurse at the Crippled Home read me about it. And there was gold in the blue stones. That's why the tramps came and got 'em, I mean  them ,' and he corrected himself. 'They told me not to say 'em,'' he added with a smile. 'Do you really think the blue stones had gold in 'em, them?' asked Ted. 'Yes, I do! Else why would the tramps want them? They came last night and took Trouble's castle, every stone, and now they've hid the gold away.' 'Where?' asked Jan, as excited as the boys. 'I think it must be up in the cave,' went on Hal. 'If we could only go there and look we could find it too. Let's go.' 'Maybe mother wouldn't let us,' suggested Ted. 'We don't have to tell her,' said Jan. 'I don't mean to do anything bad, nor have you,' went on Hal. 'But wouldn't it be great if we could go up to the cave, without anybody knowing it, and get the gold? Then your mother would be glad, and your grandpa, too.' 'Maybe they would, if there was gold in the blue stones,' agreed Ted. 'We could pretend there was,' said Janet. 'Wouldn't that be fun? But I don't want to go into that dark cave 'cept maybe grandpa goes, too, with a light.' 'You wouldn't be afraid with us, would you?' asked Hal. 'Hal and I would be with you,' added Ted. 'Well, maybe I wouldn't be afraid if you took hold of my hands. But it's dark there, awful dark.' 'I've got one of those little electric lights,' Hal said. 'My father sent it to me for my birthday when I was in the Home, and I didn't use it hardly at all, 'cause I wasn't up nights. It flashes bright. I brought it with me when I came to visit you, and I can get it and take it to the cave with us.' 'That'll be fun!' cried Ted. 'Let's go, Jan!' he pleaded. 'Well, maybe I will. But hadn't we better ask mother?' 'Maybe she'd say we couldn't,' suggested her brother, speaking very slowly. 'We'll tell her when we come back.' Of course this was not just the right thing to do, especially after Ted and his sister had been told not to go to the cave alone. But they forgot all about that when Hal spoke about gold being in the blue stones. Ted and Jan thought it would be wonderful if they could get some gold for their mother and grandfather, who was not as rich as he had been, even if he did sell a lot of cherries. 'We can't take Trouble along,' said Jan, as she saw her little brother coming out of the tent. 'We've got to leave him here.' 'Yes,' agreed Hal. 'But we don't need to go right away. We can play with him awhile. You and Ted take care of Trouble and I'll go to get my flashlight. I put it under my pillow last night.' 'And I'll get something to eat from Nora,' added Ted. 'We'll make-believe we're going on a little picnic in the woods.' 'Oh, that'll be fun!' cried Jan. She was not afraid to think of the dark cave now. 'Trouble want p'ayhouse!' cried Baby William, as he toddled up to his sister. 'Want b'ue stones.' 'I can't get you the blue stones, not now,' said Janet. 'But I guess Teddy will let you knock down his playhouse and build up another one. And you can knock down my playhouse, too. Come on, Trouble!' Knocking over the playhouses of stone which his brother and sister had built the night before seemed such great fun to the little boy, and he had such a good time doing this and, with Jan's help, making another and larger house of his own, that he forgot all about his blue stones. Ted and Hal did not forget them, though, and the more they thought of the queer way they had been taken away in the night, the more they felt sure that the stones must have gold in them, or, at least, something that the tramps wanted badly enough to come and take it. And that it was the tramps, or some man, or men, who had taken the blue stones, Hal and Ted felt certain. 'For no dog or other animal could carry away every stone,' said Hal. 'Anyhow a dog wouldn't want them, nor a fox either. It was the tramps all right.' 'Maybe they wouldn't like us to go to the cave and get the stones back,' suggested Ted. 'Well, the tramps can't have the blue stones,' said Hal, shaking his head. 'We found 'em, and they're Trouble's. But he's so little he don't want any gold, so we'll give it to your grandfather and grandmother.' 'Don't you want any?' asked Ted. 'No. My father's got lots of money. I just want to find some gold for you. I got my light from under my pillow,' and Hal showed it to Ted. They were out behind the sleeping tent talking, and Ted had his pockets full of cookies and little cakes he had begged from Nora. 'Though what in the world the child is going to do with them all, is more than I can guess,' laughed the maid. 'But I s'pose the children are always hungry.' Ted and Hal were now ready to go to the cave. They looked around the corner of the tent and saw Janet still playing with Trouble. He had gotten over crying for his blue stones, and was now busy making a playhouse of the rocks and pebbles his brother and sister had used. 'Come on, Janet! We're going!' called Ted in a loud whisper, as his sister looked at him. He also made motions with his hands to show that he and Hal were ready to start for the cave. Janet saw that her little brother was too busy playing to need her to stay with him, at least for a time. Still she could not leave him alone without calling her mother or Nora to watch what he did. Very quietly, while Baby William was trying to make one stone stay on top of another in one side of the castle he was making, Janet stepped up to the flap of the tent, inside which her mother was sitting sewing. 'I'm going with Ted and Hal into the woods,' said the little girl. 'Will you watch Trouble, Mother?' 'Yes, Janet. But be careful, and don't go too far.' Janet did not answer but hurried away. Of course she did not do just right, for she knew her mother would not want her to go to the cave, nor would Mrs. Martin have let Ted and Hal go had she known it. But the Curlytops and Hal were very desirous of finding the blue stones and of seeing if there was any gold in them, and they did not stop to think of what was right and what was wrong. 'Hurry up now!' exclaimed Hal as he went on ahead up the path that led from behind the tents to the queer cave. 'We want to get there before anybody knows it.' 'What'll we do if the tramps are there?' asked Ted. 'They won't be there,' said Hal, though how he could tell that he did not say. 'I've got a little hatchet and we can cut down some clubs,' said Ted. He had brought with him a little Boy Scout hatchet, with a covering over the sharp blade. His grandfather had given it to Ted, but had told him never to take it out alone. But Ted did, and this was another wrong thing. I'm afraid if I speak of all the wrong things the Curlytops did that day I'd never finish with this story. But it wasn't often they did so many acts they ought not to have done. On they hurried through the woods, the boys hurrying ahead of Janet. She did her best to keep up with them, but her legs were shorter than Ted's or Hal's and it was hard work for the little girl. 'Oh, wait for me!' she called at last. 'I'm awful tired.' 'Hurry up!' begged Ted. 'We want to get the blue stones before the tramps take 'em away!' 'Are they going to?' asked Janet, sitting down on a stone to rest, after she had caught up to the boys. 'Well, they might,' answered Hal. 'We've got to hurry.' They went on again, walking a little more slowly this time, and when they came to a muddy puddle in the middle of the woodland path, Ted tried to jump over it. But he slipped on the edge and one leg, from his foot to above his knee, got very wet and muddy. 'Oh, wow!' he cried. 'Now I've got to stop and clean this off.' He began to wipe off the worst of the mud on bunches of grass, while Janet sat down on a log near by. 'I'm sorry you fell in the mud, Teddy,' she said, 'but I'm glad I can rest, for I'm awful tired. You go so fast!' [Illustration: HAL WALKED BOLDLY INTO THE DARK CAVE.  Page 224 ] 'Come on, hurry up!' called Hal, as Ted still brushed away with the bunch of grass. 'Let it dry and it will come off easier.' 'I guess it will,' agreed Ted, looking at his muddy stocking. 'It won't come off this way.' However, the accident had given his sister a little chance to rest, and now Janet was able to keep up with the boys. Pretty soon they were near the hole into which Ted had fallen, and out of which the cave opened. 'Now be careful!' whispered Hal, as he got out his flashlight. 'Maybe the tramps are there!' 'I've got my hatchet!' exclaimed Ted. 'I'm not going in if the tramps are there,' declared Janet. 'We'll look first, and see,' offered Hal. 'But I don't want to stay here alone!' objected Janet, as her brother and Hal slid down into the hole and looked into the black opening of the cave. 'We won't go very far,' promised Ted. 'We'll be back in a minute. Don't be afraid.' Then he and Hal went into the cave, while Jan, half wanting to cry, waited outside. CHAPTER XIX THE BLUE LIGHT AGAIN Flashing his light about, Hal walked boldly into the dark cave. Ted followed, just a little bit afraid, though he did not want to say so. 'Don't go too far,' begged Janet's brother. 'Jan'll be afraid if we leave her alone.' 'I won't go far,' promised Hal. 'I just want to see if there're any tramps in here.' 'Listen an' maybe you can hear them talking,' suggested Ted. Hal, though larger and older than Ted, was not quite brave enough to go very far into the dark cave, even if he did have his light with him. So, after taking a few steps, he stopped and listened. So did Ted. They could hear nothing but the voice of Janet calling to them from outside. 'Ted! Hal!' cried the little girl. 'Where are you? I'm going back to camp!' 'We're coming!' answered Ted. 'Come on back and get her,' he added to his chum. 'Then we'll look for the blue rocks.' 'I guess we can't find them unless they're right around here,' returned Hal, as he moved his light about in a circle. 'Why not?' asked Ted. 'Because this cave is so dark, and my flashlamp doesn't give much light. We could hardly see the stones if they were here.' 'Then how are we going to get 'em?' Ted demanded. 'I guess we'll have to bring a big lantern. Maybe we ought to bring your grandfather along.' 'I guess we had better,' agreed Ted. 'But we can look a little bit when we're here. Let's go for Janet. She's crying.' Janet was crying by this time, not liking to be left alone outside while the boys were in the cave. They ran back to her and her tears were soon dried. 'Will you come in a little way with us?' asked her brother. 'There isn't anything to be afraid of. Is there, Hal?' 'No, not a thing. We won't go in very far, Jan. And maybe you can see the blue stones. We couldn't, but sometimes girls' eyes are better than boys. Come on!' So with Hal holding a hand on one side, and Ted on the other, Janet went slowly into the cave with her brother and his chum. Hal flashed his light, and by its gleam the Curlytops could see that the cave was large, larger even than it had seemed when they were in it with their grandfather. 'Look on the floor for the rocks,' suggested Hal. 'That's where the tramp-man would put 'em if he brought 'em here.' But they did not see the blue rocks, nor any others. The floor of the cave seemed to be of stone or hard clay, and there was nothing on it. They did not go in far enough to see the sacks which Grandpa Martin said someone had used for a bed, nor did the children see the bread and other bits of food which might have meant that someone had had a picnic in the cave. 'I guess the rocks aren't here,' said Hal, in disappointed tones as Janet said she wanted to turn back, for she did not like it in the cave. 'Or else maybe they're away at the far end.' 'I'm not going there!' exclaimed Ted. 'No, I guess we won't go,' agreed Hal. 'We'll go and tell your grandfather and have him come with a big lantern.' 'Hark! What's that?' suddenly called Jan, taking a tighter hold of her brother's hand. From the back part of the cave came a noise. It was as though a rock had fallen, probably it had, from the roof of the cavern. 'Someone's throwing stones at us!' cried Ted. 'Who? Who? Who?' a voice seemed to ask. 'Oh, dear! We don't know who it was!' cried Janet. 'Come on out of here! I'm afraid!' 'That was only an owl,' said Hal with a laugh. 'Owls live in dark caves in the daytime and when it's dark they hoot and call 'who!' I've heard 'em lots of times around the Home.' 'There isn't any cave at the Home,' objected Ted, who was as frightened as Janet was. 'No, but there were owls in the trees. I heard 'em lots of times. But we'll go out. I guess maybe that was a loose stone that fell down and made the first noise. But we don't want any to fall on our heads. Come on!' called Hal. Together he and Ted led Janet back to the mouth of the cave, where they could see the sunshine. And even Hal, who was not so frightened as the Curlytops had been, was glad to get out. 'It's too bad we couldn't find the blue gold-stones,' he said. 'But maybe the tramps didn't hide them there, anyhow. We'll look around some more.' 'Let's eat,' suggested Ted. 'I'm hungry, and I've got a lot of cookies in my pockets.' So they sat down on a stone in a shady place not far from the cave and ate the things Nora had given Ted. They then got a drink from a bubbling spring not far away, and pretended they were on a picnic. Ted's muddy stocking had dried by this time, and he and Jan, using sticks, scraped most of the dirt off. 'Now we'd better be going home,' Jan suggested after a bit. 'There isn't any fun here.' 'Yes, we might as well go,' agreed Hal. 'And I'll tell you what let's do!' 'What?' demanded Ted. 'Let's look in the place where Trouble found those blue stones and see if we can find any more.' 'Oh, yes, let's!' cried Janet. She was happy again, now that she was out in the bright sunshine. The children remembered where Baby William had found the pretty rocks from which he had made his castle, but when they reached the place not a one was to be had, though they searched all about. 'I guess Trouble took them all,' said Janet. 'I remember now, I helped him look for more and we couldn't find any.' 'Well, maybe there'll be some more somewhere else,' suggested Hal hopefully. 'Let's look.' So they looked, wandering about in the woods not far from camp, until they heard Nora ringing the bell for dinner. 'Well, where have you children been?' asked Mrs. Martin as they came trooping up to the tent, tired, hungry and dirty. 'Oh, we've been looking for gold,' explained Ted, but he did not say they had visited the cave, where they had been told not to go. 'You didn't dig any more deep holes, did you?' asked his grandfather. 'No, sir,' answered Ted. After dinner Ted asked Hal why he didn't speak of having Grandpa Martin go to the cave with the big lantern. 'I thought you were going to do that,' he said to Hal. 'Well, I was. But maybe we can find some more of the blue stones for ourselves. We'll look around before we ask your grandpa to help.' Janet wanted to stay around camp and play with her dolls that afternoon, and she took care of Trouble. 'Then we'll go for a goat ride,' said Ted. 'Come on, Hal.' The two boys hitched Nicknack to the wagon, and set off down the island. 'We'll look for some more blue rocks,' suggested Hal, and Ted was willing. On and on the two boys rode, now stopping to look at some pretty flower, again waiting to hear the finish of some bird's song. They looked on both sides of the woodland path for some of the blue rocks, but, though they saw some of other colors, there were none like those they wanted. 'Whoa there, where are you going now?' Ted suddenly called to Nicknack, and the little boy pulled on the reins by which he guided the goat, or 'steered' it, as he sometimes called it. 'What's the matter?' asked Hal. 'Nicknack wants to go over that way and I want him to go straight ahead,' answered Ted. 'Maybe he sees some of those blue rocks the way he wants to go,' suggested Hal. 'Oh, I don't guess so,' replied his chum. 'I guess he just wants to get some new kind of grass to eat. Whoa, Nicknack, I tell you!' and Teddy pulled as hard as he could on the reins, without hurting his goat, for he never wanted to do that. But the goat would not go straight down the island path. He kept pulling off to one side, and at last Ted cried: 'Here, Hal, you take hold of the lines and pull with me. Maybe we can steer him around then.' 'Can we pull real hard, I mean will the lines break?' asked Hal. 'Oh, no, they're good and strong,' answered Ted. So he and his chum both pulled on the one rein, the one to get Nicknack's head pointed straight down the path instead of off to one side, but it did no good. The goat knew what he wanted to do, and he was going to do it. 'Look out!' suddenly cried Teddy. 'We're going to tip over!' The next minute the front wheels of the wagon ran up on a little pile of dirt at one side of the path, and the cart gently tilted to one side and then went over with a rattle and a bang. 'There!' laughed Hal, as he rolled out on some soft grass. 'We are over, Ted.' 'I knew we were going,' said Teddy as he, too, laughed and got up. 'Whoa there, Nicknack!' he shouted, for the goat was still going on, dragging the overturned wagon after him. But Nicknack did not stop until he reached a little bush, on which were some green leaves that he seemed to like very much, for he began to chew them. 'That's what he wanted all the while,' said Teddy. 'Well, let him eat all he wants, and then he won't be hungry any more and he'll pull us where we want to go,' advised Hal. They did this, after setting the cart up on its wheels. When Nicknack turned away from the bush, and looked at the two waiting boys, Ted said: 'Well, I guess we can go on now.' 'Yes,' added Hal, 'and I hope well find those blue rocks. But I don't believe we're ever going to.' At last, however, when it was getting rather late in the afternoon and Ted had said it was time to go back, Hal, who was driving the goat through a part of the woods they never before had visited, pointed to a big stone buried in the side of a hill and cried: 'Look! Isn't that rock blue, Ted?' 'It does look kind of blue, yes.' 'Then it's just what we're looking for. See, there's lots of little blue rocks, too. Let's take some back to camp. Maybe they're the same kind Trouble had, and there may be gold in 'em! Come on.' They piled the rocks, which were certainly somewhat blue in color, into the wagon, and started back with them. 'We found 'em! We found 'em!' they called as they came within sight of the tents. 'We got the blue rocks!' 'Well, they're pretty, certainly,' said Grandpa Martin, as he picked up one from the wagon, 'but they're no better than any other rocks around here, as far as I can see.' 'They've got gold in 'em, Hal says,' Ted stated. 'Gold? Oh, no, Curlytop!' laughed his grandfather. 'I've told you there is no gold on this island.' 'There's  something  in the blue rocks,' declared Hal. 'Feel how heavy they are, lots heavier than any other stones around here.' 'Yes, they are,' agreed Grandpa Martin, as he weighed one of the stones in his hand. 'There might be some iron in them, but not gold. Look out!' he suddenly called as the stone slipped from his hand. 'Look out for your toes!' Laughing, the Curlytops and Hal jumped back. The blue stone which Grandpa Martin dropped, struck on the edge of the shovel which was out in front of the tent. As the rock hit the steel tool with a clang, something queer happened. At once the rock began to burn with a curious blue flame, and a yellowish smoke curled up. 'Oh, the rock's on fire!' cried Janet. 'The rock's on fire!' 'Yes, and look!' added Ted. 'It's burning blue, just like the light we saw on the island one night.' 'And how queer it smells!' exclaimed Hal. 'Sulphur!' ejaculated Grandpa Martin. He and the children looked at the queer blue fire that seemed to come from inside the rock. What could it mean? CHAPTER XX THE HAPPY TRAMP Grandpa Martin stood looking down at the queer, burning rock. The blue fire was flaming up brighter now, and it made a strange light on the faces of the Curlytops and Hal as they gathered about. The sky was cloudy and it was getting dark. 'Oh, what is it? What is it?' asked Ted and Jan. 'It smells just like old-fashioned sulphur matches that my grandmother used to light,' said Nora, who had come out, having seen the queer light from the cook-tent. 'And it  is  sulphur that is burning,' said Grandpa Martin. 'That rock has sulphur in it, not gold, Hal. And it is the sulphur that is burning with the blue fire.' 'But what makes it?' asked the children. Grandpa Martin did not answer for a few seconds. He stood again looking down at the flaming blue rock. Mrs. Martin, who had started to put Trouble to bed early, came out and looked. 'It's like something I once saw in the theater,' said the maid. 'I don't like it, that blue light. It reminds me of the time our house was struck by lightning, that sulphur smell.' 'It is the same smell,' said Mr. Martin. 'Curlytops, I think you have found something very queer in this blue rock. I don't know just what it is, but we'll find out. See, the stone is burning like a lump of coal now, but with a blue flame instead of red.' 'Just like the night we saw the blue fire on the island before we came camping here,' said Ted. 'Is it the same thing, Grandpa?' 'I don't know. Perhaps it is. Where did you get the blue rocks?' 'Over in the woods,' answered Hal. 'There's a great big one there. As big as this tent.' 'Is there?' some one suddenly asked. 'Then please show me where it is! Oh, can it be that at last I have found what I have been looking for so long?' The Curlytops and the others turned at the sound of this new and strange voice. A man seemed to spring out of the bushes back of the tent. By the light of the blue fire Ted and Jan saw that his clothes were ragged and torn in many places. 'Oh! Oh!' gasped Jan. 'That's the tramp!' 'Well, I guess maybe I do look like a tramp, all ragged and dirty as I am,' laughed the man, and his voice sounded pleasant. 'But I am not a regular tramp. I am Mr. Weston, Alfred Weston,' he went on, speaking to Grandpa Martin. 'I haven't a card with me, but when I get washed and dressed and shaved I'll look more like what I am. Excuse me for intruding this way, but I could not keep from speaking when I heard what you were talking about.' 'Then aren't you a tramp?' asked Ted. 'No, though I have been  tramping  all over this island looking for the very blue rock you children seem to have found. I wear my oldest clothes, just as my friend Professor Anderson does, for we have been going through briar bushes, into caves and mud holes and our clothes are a sad sight. But we are not tramps.' 'Is there someone with you?' asked Grandpa Martin, looking over the man's head toward the bushes, out of which he had come. 'There was another. Anderson is his name. But he has gone to the village, and I was on my way to row across the lake to join him when I happened to pass by your tent, saw the blue light, and heard what your children said. Do you really know where there is a big blue rock like this little one that is on fire?' he asked as he pointed to the flaming blue light. 'Yes, we found a big one,' said Hal. 'If you will show me where it is you will get a lot of money,' said Mr. Weston. 'That is, if you will sell me the meteor,' he went on to Grandpa Martin. 'I understand you own part of this island,' he added. 'About half of it, yes. But are you looking for a meteor?' 'Yes, for a meteor, or fallen star, and the blue rock your children found is part of it. We have been looking for it a long time, my friend and myself, and we had about given up. Now we may get it. Will you sell me the fallen star?' he asked. 'I'll see about it,' promised Mr. Martin with a smile. 'Perhaps you will come into our tent and tell us about it. Are you, well, I was going to say the tramp, but are you the man we saw before, wandering about our camp?' 'I presume I am. I don't mind being called a tramp, for I certainly look like one. However, now that the fallen star is found I don't need to be so ragged.' 'Are you the ragged man that pulled Trouble out of the spring?' asked Ted, as they watched the blue light die away. 'I did pull a little boy out of the spring,' answered Mr. Weston, 'though I didn't know his name was Trouble.' 'That's only his pet name,' laughed Grandpa Martin. 'But come and sit down and tell us your story. The children have been wondering a long while what the blue light meant, and who the ragged man was. And, to-day, they've been trying to find what became of the blue rocks that Trouble made into a playhouse.' 'I took those rocks, I'm sorry to say,' answered the ragged man. 'I'm sorry to have spoiled Trouble's playhouse. I wanted those pieces of rock, for I thought perhaps they were all I would ever be able to get of the fallen star.' 'Was the blue rock really once a star?' asked Hal. 'Well, yes, a part of one, or at least part of a meteor, or shooting star, as they are called. Now I'll tell you all that happened, and I'm sorry if I have frightened you. My friend and I didn't mean to. 'Some time ago,' went on Mr. Weston, 'we heard about Star Island, this place that was so named because it was said a big meteor had landed here many years back. Professor Anderson and I decided to come here and see if we could find it for the museum which is connected with the college in which Anderson teaches. 'For we knew that, though most meteors are burned up as they shoot through the air before they strike the earth, yet some come down in big chunks, and we wanted such a one if we could get it. So we hunted for it all over this island. We saw you, but you were never very near. Sometimes we stayed in the cave at night, but usually went back to the mainland. All the while we were hunting for the blue rocks, for that is the color of this particular meteor. 'A few nights before you folks came here to camp, when we were digging in the ground hoping to find what we wanted, our shovel must have struck a piece of the meteor, for there was a flash of blue fire that burned for quite a while.' 'We saw it,' cried Ted, 'and we didn't know what it was!' 'Teddy and me, we saw it!' added Jan. 'Well, that was all of the meteor we could find for some time,' went on Mr. Weston. 'And as that burned up, was consumed, we didn't have any. Then, the other night through the bushes we happened to come upon some blue stones, and I took them away. 'Then my friend and I hunted again to find the big piece of the fallen star, but we could not come across it. I was about to give up, but now we are all right. I am so glad! Can you take me to the big blue rock?' 'We will to-morrow,' answered Hal. 'It's too dark to find it now.' 'You had better stay in our camp until morning,' was Grandpa Martin's kindly invitation, and Mr. Weston did so. 'This meteor is a good bit like a sulphur match,' said Mr. Weston. 'When anything hard, like iron or steel, strikes it, blue fire starts and burns up the rock. The big piece will be very valuable. 'But we'll have to be careful not to set it ablaze. We picked up a lot of different rocks on the island, hoping some of them might be pieces of the meteor. But none was. Once I saw your little girl picking flowers, as I was gathering rocks. I guess she thought I was a tramp. Did I scare you?' he asked Janet. 'A little,' she answered with a smile. 'Sometimes we stayed in a cave we found on the island,' went on Mr. Weston. 'I thought once the meteor might be there, but it was not.' The next day Ted, Janet and Hal, followed by all the others in camp, even down to Trouble, whose mother carried him, went to the place where the big blue rock was buried in the side of the hill. As soon as he had looked at it Mr. Weston said it was the very meteor for which he and Professor Anderson had been looking so long. They seemed to have missed coming to the hill. The museum directors bought the fallen star from Grandpa Martin, on whose part of the island it had fallen many years before, and so the owner of Cherry Farm had as much money as before the flood spoiled so many of his crops. Thus the story of the fallen star, after which the island was named, was true, you see, though it had happened so many years ago that most folk had forgotten about it. A few days after Mr. Weston had been led to the queer blue rock, he and Professor Anderson, no longer dressed like tramps, brought some men to the island and the big rock was carefully dug out with wooden shovels, as the wood was soft and could not strike sparks and make blue fire. 'For a time,' said Mr. Weston to Grandpa Martin, after the meteor had been taken to the mainland in a big boat, 'I thought you were a scientist.' 'Me, a scientist!' laughed the children's grandfather. 'Yes. I thought maybe you had heard about the fallen star and had come here and were trying to find it, too.' 'No, I haven't any use for fallen stars,' said Mr. Martin. 'I had heard the story about one being on this island, but I never quite believed it. I just came here to give the children a good time camping.' 'Well, I think they had it, every one of them,' laughed Mr. Weston, as he looked at the brown Curlytops, who were tanned like Indians. 'Oh, we've had the loveliest time in the world!' cried Jan, as she held her grandfather's hand. 'We're going to stay here a long while yet. Aren't we, Grandpa?' 'Well, I'm afraid not much longer,' said Grandpa Martin. 'The days are getting shorter and the nights longer. It will soon be too cold to live in a tent on Star Island.' 'Oh, Grandpa!' And Jan looked sad. 'But we want to have fun!' cried Ted. 'Oh, I guess you'll have fun,' said his mother. 'You always do every winter.' And the children did. In the next volume of this series, to be called 'The Curlytops Snowed In; or, Grand Fun with Skates and Sleds,' you may read about the good times they had when they went back home. 'Come on, Jan, we'll have a last ride with Nicknack!' called Ted to his sister about a week after the meteor had been dug up. In a few days the Curlytops were to leave their camp on Star Island. Hal Chester had gone back to his home, promising to visit his friends again some day. 'I'm coming!' cried Jan. 'Me, too!' added Trouble. 'I wants a wide!' Into the goat cart they piled and off started Nicknack, waggling his funny, stubby tail, for he enjoyed the children as much as they did him. 'Hurray!' yelled Ted. 'Isn't this fun?' and he cracked the whip in the air. 'Hurray!' yelled Jan and Trouble. 'Baa-a-a-a!' bleated Nicknack. That was his way of cheering. And so we will leave the Curlytops and say good-bye. THE END     THE CURLYTOPS SERIES     BY HOWARD R. GARIS     Author of the famous 'Bedtime Animal Stories'      12mo. Cloth.

But, no sooner had he stepped on the floor, than he cried out: 'Oh! Ouch! Oh, dear me and a potato pancake! Oh, I believe I stepped on a tack! Sammie Littletail must have left it there! How careless of him!' You see this was the same Uncle Wiggily, of whom I have told you in the Bedtime Books, the very same Uncle Wiggily. He was an Uncle to Sammie and Susie Littletail, the rabbit children, and also to Billie and Johnnie Bushytail, the squirrel boys, and to Alice and Lulu and Jimmie Wibblewobble, the duck children, and I have written for you, books about all those characters. Now I thought I would write something just about Uncle Wiggily himself, though of course I'll tell you what all his nephews and nieces did, too. Well, when Uncle Wiggily felt that sharp pain, he stood still for a moment, and wondered what could have happened. 'Yes, I'm almost sure it was a tack,' he said. 'I must pick it up so no one else will step on it.' So Uncle Wiggily looked on the floor, but there was no tack there, only some crumbs from a sugar cookie that Susie Littletail had been eating the night before, when her uncle had told her a go-to-sleep story. 'Oh, I know what it was; it must have been my rheumatism that gave me the pain!' said the old gentleman rabbit as he looked for his red, white and blue crutch, striped like a barber pole. He found it under the bed, and then he managed to limp to the window. Surely enough, the sun was shining. 'I'll certainly have to do something about this rheumatism,' said Uncle Wiggily as he carefully shaved himself by looking in the glass. 'I guess I'll see Dr. Possum.' So after breakfast, when Sammie and Susie had gone to school, Dr. Possum was telephoned for, and he called to see Uncle Wiggily. 'Ha! Hum!' exclaimed the doctor, looking very wise. 'You have the rheumatism very bad, Mr. Longears.' 'Why, I knew that before you came,' said the old gentleman rabbit, blinking his eyes. 'What I want is something to cure it.' 'Ha! Hum!' said Dr. Possum, again looking very wise. 'I think you need a change of air. You must travel about. Go on a journey, get out and see strange birds, and pick the pretty flowers. You don't get exercise enough.' 'Exercise enough!' cried Uncle Wiggily. 'Why, my goodness me sakes alive and a bunch of lilacs! Don't I play checkers almost every night with Grandfather Goosey Gander?' 'That is not enough,' said the doctor, 'you must travel here and there, and see things.' 'Very well,' said Uncle Wiggily, 'then I will travel. I'll pack my valise at once, and I'll go off and seek my fortune, and maybe, on the way, I can lose this rheumatism.' So the next day Uncle Wiggily started out with his crutch, and his valise packed full of clean clothes, and something in it to eat. 'Oh, we are very sorry to have you go, dear uncle,' said Susie Littletail, 'but we hope you'll come back good and strong.' 'Thank you,' said Uncle Wiggily, as he kissed the two rabbit children and their mamma, and shook hands with Papa Littletail. Then off the old gentleman bunny hopped with his crutch. Well, he went along for quite a distance, over the hills, and down the road, and through the woods, and, as the sun got higher and warmer, his rheumatism felt better. 'I do believe Dr. Possum was right!' said Uncle Wiggily. 'Traveling is just the thing for me,' and he felt so very jolly that he whistled a little tune about a peanut wagon, which roasted lemonade, and boiled and frizzled Easter eggs that Mrs. Cluk-Cluk laid. 'Ha! Where are you going?' suddenly asked a voice, as Uncle Wiggily finished the tune. 'I'm going to seek my fortune,' replied Uncle Wiggily. 'Who are you, pray?' 'Oh, I'm a friend of yours,' said the voice, and Uncle Wiggily looked all around, but he couldn't discover any one. 'But where are you?' the puzzled old gentleman rabbit wanted to know. 'I can't see you.' 'No, and for a very good reason,' answered the voice. 'You see I have very weak eyes, and if I came out in the sun, without my smoked glasses on, I might get blind. So I have to hide down in this hollow stump.' 'Then put on your glasses and come out where I can see you,' invited the old gentleman rabbit, and all the while he was trying to remember where he had heard that voice before. At first he thought it might be Grandfather Goosey Gander, or Uncle Butter, the goat, yet it didn't sound like either of them. 'I have sent my glasses to the store to be fixed, so I can't wear them and come out,' went on the voice. 'But if you are seeking your fortune I know the very place where you can find it.' 'Where?' asked Uncle Wiggily, eagerly. 'Right down in this hollow stump,' was the reply. 'There are all kinds of fortunes here, and you may take any kind you like Mr. Longears.' 'Ha! That is very nice,' thought the rabbit. 'I have not had to travel far before finding my fortune. I wonder if there is a cure for rheumatism in that stump, too?' So he asked about it. 'Of course, your rheumatism can be cured in here,' came the quick answer. 'In fact, I guarantee to cure any disease, measles, chicken-pox, mumps and even toothache. So if you have any friends you want cured send them to me.' 'I wish I could find out who you were,' spoke the rabbit. 'I seem to know your voice, but I can't think of your name.' 'Oh, you'll know me as soon as you see me,' said the voice. 'Just hop down inside this hollow stump, and your fortune is as good as made, and your rheumatism will soon be gone. Hop right down.' Well, Uncle Wiggily didn't like the looks of the black hole down inside the stump, and he peered into it to see what he could see, but it was so black that all he could make out was something like a lump of coal. 'Well, Dr. Possum said I needed to have a change of scene, and some adventures,' said the rabbit, 'so I guess I'll chance it. I'll go down, and perhaps I may find my fortune.' Then, carefully holding his crutch and his satchel, Uncle Wiggily hopped down inside the stump. He felt something soft, and furry, and fuzzy, pressing close to him, and at first he thought he had bumped into Dottie or Willie Lambkin. But then, all of a sudden, a harsh voice cried out: 'Ha! Now I have you! I was just wishing some one would come along with my dinner, and you did! Get in there, and see if you can find your fortune, Uncle Wiggily!' And with that what should happen but that big, black bear, who had been hiding in the stump, pushed Uncle Wiggily into a dark closet, and locked the door! And there the poor rabbit was, and the bear was getting ready to eat him up. But don't worry, I'll find a way to get him out, and in case we have ice cream pancakes for supper I'll tell you, in the next story, how Uncle Wiggily got out of the bear's den, and how he went fishing, I mean Uncle Wiggily went fishing, not the bear. STORY II UNCLE WIGGILY GOES FISHING At first, after he found himself shut up in the bear's dark closet, where we left him in the story before this, poor Uncle Wiggily didn't know what to think. He just sat there, on the edge of a chair, and he tried to look around, and see something, but it was too black, so he couldn't. 'Perhaps this is only a joke,' thought the old gentleman rabbit, 'though I never knew a black bear to joke before. But perhaps it is. I'll ask him.' So Uncle Wiggily called out: 'Is this a joke, Mr. Bear?' 'Not a bit of it!' was the growling answer. 'You'll soon see what's going to happen to you! I'm getting the fire ready now.' 'Getting the fire ready for what; the adventure, or for my fortune?' asked the rabbit, for he still hoped the bear was only joking with him. 'Ready to cook you!' was the reply. 'That's what the fire is for!' and the bear gnashed his teeth together something terrible, and, with his sharp claws, he clawed big splinters off the stump, and with them he started the fire in the stove, with the splinters, I mean, not his claws. The blazing fire made it a little brighter in the hollow stump, which was the black bear's den, and Uncle Wiggily could look out of a crack in the door, and see what a savage fellow the shaggy bear was. You see, that bear just hid in the stump, waiting for helpless animals to come along, and then he'd trick them into jumping down inside of it, and there wasn't a word of truth about him having sore eyes, or about him having to wear dark spectacles, either. 'Oh, my! I guess this is the end of my adventures,' thought the rabbit. 'I should have been more careful. Well, I wish I could see Sammie and Susie before he eats me, but I'm afraid I can't. I shouldn't have jumped down here.' But as Uncle Wiggily happened to think of Sammie Littletail, the boy rabbit, he also thought of something else. And this was that Sammie had put something in the old gentleman rabbit's valise that morning, before his uncle had started off. 'If you ever get into trouble, Uncle Wiggily,' Sammie had said, 'this may come in useful for you.' Uncle Wiggily didn't look at the time to see what it was that his nephew put in the valise, but he made up his mind he would do so now. So he opened his satchel, and there, among other things, was a long piece of thin, but strong rope. And pinned to it was a note which read: 'Dear Uncle Wiggily. This is good to help you get out of a window, in case of fire.' 'My goodness!' exclaimed Uncle Wiggily, 'that's fine. There the bear is making a fire to cook me, and with this rope I can get away from it. Now if there's only a window in this closet I'm all right.' So he looked, and sure enough there was a window. And with his crutch Uncle Wiggily raised it. Then he threw out his satchel, and he tied the rope to a hook on the window sill, and, being a strong old gentleman, he crawled out of the window, and slid down the cord. And Uncle Wiggily got out just as the bear opened the closet door to grab him, and put him in the pot, and when the savage black creature saw his fine rabbit dinner getting away he was as angry as anything, really he was. 'Here! Come back here!' cried the bear, but of course Uncle Wiggily knew better than to come back. He slid down the rope to the ground, and then he cut off as much of the rope as he could, and put it in his pocket, for he didn't know when he might need it again. Then, catching up his valise, he ran on and on, before the bear could get to him. It was still quite a dark place in which Uncle Wiggily was, for you see he was underground, down by the roots of the stump. But he looked ahead and he saw a little glimmer of light, and then he knew he could get out. Limping on his crutch, and carrying his valise, he went on and on, and pretty soon he came out of a dark cave and found himself on the bank of a nice little brook, that was running over mossy, green stones. 'Ha! This is better than being in a bear's den!' exclaimed the old gentleman rabbit. 'My, I was so frightened that I forgot about my rheumatism hurting me. That was an adventure all right, and Sammie was a good boy to think of that strong cord. Now what shall I do next?' Well, Uncle Wiggily sat down on the bank of the brook, and he looked in the water. Then he happened to see a fish jump up to catch a bug, so he said to himself: 'I guess I will go fishing, just for fun. But if I do happen to catch any fish I'll put them right back in the water again. For I don't need any fish, as I have some lettuce and cabbage sandwiches, and some peanut-butter cakes, that Susie's mamma put up in a cracker-box for me.' Well, Uncle Wiggily looked in his valise, to make sure his lunch was safe, and then, taking a bent pin from under his vest, he fastened it to a part of the string Sammie had given him. Then he fastened the string to a pole, and he was ready to fish, but he needed something to make the fishes bite, that is, bite the pinhook, not bite him, you know. 'Oh, I guess they'll like a bit of sweet cracker,' Uncle Wiggily thought; so he put some on the end of the pin-hook, and threw it toward the water. It fell in with a splash, and made a lot of little circles, like ring-around the rosies, and the rabbit sat there looking at them, sort of nodding, and half asleep and wondering what adventure would happen to him next, and where he would stay that night. All of a sudden he felt something tugging at the hook and line. 'Oh, I've got a fish! I've got a fish!' he cried, as he lifted up the pole. Up out of the water with a sizzling rush flew the string and the sweet cracker bait, and the next minute out leaped the big, savage alligator that had escaped from a circus. 'Oh, ho! So you tried to catch me, eh?' the alligator shouted at Uncle Wiggily. 'No, no, if you please,' said the rabbit. 'I was after fish.' 'And I'm after you!' cried the alligator, and, scrambling up the bank, he made a jump for Uncle Wiggily, and with one sweep of his kinky, scaly tail he flopped and he threw the old gentleman rabbit and his crutch and valise right up into a big tree that grew near the brook. 'There you'll stay until I get ready to eat you!' exclaimed the alligator, as he stood up on the end of his tail under the tree, and opened his mouth as wide as he could so that if Uncle Wiggily fell down he'd fall into it, just like down a funnel, you know. Well, the poor gentleman rabbit clung to the topmost tree branch, wondering how in the world he was going to escape from the alligator. Oh, it was a dreadful position to be in! But please don't worry or stay awake over it, for I'll find a way to get him down safely. And in the story after this, if the milkman doesn't leave us sour cream for our lemonade, I'll tell you about Uncle Wiggily and the black crow. STORY III UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BLACK CROW Let me see, where did I leave off in the last story? Oh! I remember. It was about Uncle Wiggily Longears being up in the top of the tall tree, and the alligator keeping guard down below, ready to eat him. Well, the old gentleman rabbit was wondering how he could ever escape, and he felt quite badly about it. 'I guess this is the end of my adventures,' he said to himself. 'It would have been much better had I stayed at home with Sammie and Susie.' And as he thought of the two rabbit children he felt still sadder, and very lonely. 'I wonder if Susie could have put anything in my satchel with which to scare an alligator,' thought Uncle Wiggily. 'I guess I'll look.' So he looked, and what should he find but a bottle of toothache drops. Yes, there it was, and wrapped ground it was a little note Susie had written. 'Dear Uncle Wiggily,' she said in the note, 'if you ever get the toothache on your travels, this will stop it.' 'Ha! That is very kind of Susie, I'm sure,' said the rabbit, 'but I don't see how that is going to make the alligator go away. And, even if he does go, I wonder how I'm to get down out of this tall tree, with my crutch, my valise and my rheumatism?' Well, just then the alligator got tired of standing on the end of his tail, with his mouth open, and he began crawling around. Then he thought of what a good supper he was going to have of Uncle Wiggily, and that alligator said: 'I guess I'll sharpen my teeth so I can eat him better,' and with that the savage and unpleasant creature began to gnaw on a stone, to sharpen his teeth. Then he stood up on the end of his tail once more, under the tree, and opened his mouth as wide as he could. 'Come on now!' he called to Uncle Wiggily. 'Jump down and have it over with.' 'Oh, but I don't want to,' objected the rabbit. 'You'll have to, whether you want to or not,' went on the alligator. 'If you don't come down, I'll take my scaly, naily tail, and I'll saw down the tree, and then you'll fall.' 'Oh, dear!' exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. 'What shall I do?' Then he happened to think of the bottle of toothache medicine that he held in his hand, and, taking out the cork, he dropped the bottle, medicine and all, right into the open mouth of the alligator, who was again up on his tail. And the alligator thought it was Uncle Wiggily falling into his jaws, and he shut them quickly like a steel trap and chewed on that bottle of hot toothache drops before he knew what it was. Well, you can just imagine what happened. The medicine was as hot as pepper and mustard and vinegar and cloves and horse radish all made into one! My! how it did burn that alligator's mouth. 'Oh my! I'm shot! I'm poisoned! I'm bitten by a mosquito! I'm stabbed! I'm all scrambled up' cried the alligator. 'Water, water, quick! I must have water!' Then he gave a big jump, and, with his kinkery-scalery tail, he leaped into a big puddle of water, and went away down in under, out of sight, to cool off his mouth. 'Oh, now is my chance! If I could only get down out of the tree!' exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. 'But with my rheumatism I'm afraid I'll fall. Oh dear! What shall I do?' 'Don't be afraid, I'll help you!' exclaimed a kind voice, and then the voice went on: 'Caw! Caw! Caw!' and Uncle Wiggily, looking up, saw a big black crow perched on a limb over his head. 'Oh, how do you do!' spoke Uncle Wiggily, making a bow as well as he could. 'Can you really help me down?' 'Yes,' said the crow, 'I can. Wait until I get my market basket. I was just going to the grocery, but I'm in no hurry. I'll save you first.' So that crow flew off, and in a moment he came back with a big basket in its bill. 'Hop in!' the black crow called to Uncle Wiggily, 'and I'll fly down to the ground with you, and you can run off before the alligator comes out of the water. I saw what you did to him with those toothache drops, and it served him right. Come on, hop in the basket.' So Uncle Wiggily got in the basket, and the crow, taking the handle in his strong beak, flew safely to the ground with him. And that's how the old gentleman rabbit got down out of the tree, just as I told you he would. So he and the crow walked on some distance through the woods together, after Uncle Wiggily had picked up his crutch and valise, which had fallen out of the basket, and they got safely away before the alligator came out of the water. And wasn't he the provoked old beastie, though, when he saw that his rabbit supper was gone? 'Where are you going?' asked the crow of Uncle Wiggily, after a bit, when they got to a nice big stone, and sat down for a rest. 'I am seeking my fortune,' replied the old gentleman rabbit, 'and trying to get better of my rheumatism. Dr. Possum told me to travel, and have adventures, and I've had quite a few already.' 'Well, I hope you find your fortune and that it turns out to be a very good one,' said the kind crow. 'But it is coming on night now. Have you any place to stay?' 'No,' replied the rabbit, 'I haven't. I never thought about that. What shall I do?' 'Oh, don't worry,' said the crow. 'I'd let you stay in my nest, but it is up a high tree, and you would have trouble climbing in and out. But near my nest-house is an old hollow stump, and you can stay in that very nicely.' 'Are there any bears in it?' asked Uncle Wiggily, careful-like. 'Oh, no; not a one. It is very safe.' So the crow showed Uncle Wiggily where the hollow stump was, and he slept there all night, on a soft bed of leaves. And when he awakened in the morning he had breakfast with the crow and once more started off to seek his fortune. Well, pretty soon, in a short while, not so very long, he came to a little house made of bark, standing in the middle of a deep, dark, dismal woods. And on the door of the house was a sign which read: 'If you want to be surprised, open this door and come in.' 'Perhaps I can find my fortune in there, and get rid of the rheumatism,' thought Uncle Wiggily, so he hopped forward. And just as he did so he heard a voice calling to him: 'Don't go in! Don't go in there, Uncle Wiggily!' The rabbit looked up, and saw Johnnie Bushytail, the squirrel boy, waving his paws at him. Well, Uncle Wiggily started to jump back away from the door of the little house, but it was too late. Out came a scraggily-raggily claw, which grabbed him, while a voice cried out: 'Ah, ha! Now I have you! Come right in!' And then, before you could shake a stick at a bad dog, the door was slammed shut and locked, and there Uncle Wiggily was inside the house, and Johnnie Bushytail was crying outside. 'That's the end of poor Uncle Wiggily!' said Johnnie. But it wasn't. For I'll not leave the old gentleman rabbit alone in the house with that clawy creature. And in the next story, providing our wash lady doesn't put my new straw hat in the soap suds, and take all the color out of the ribbon, I'll tell you about Uncle Wiggily and Fido Flip-Flop. STORY IV UNCLE WIGGILY AND FIDO FLIP-FLOP Well, as soon as Uncle Wiggily found himself inside the bear's den, oh, just listen to me! That was in the other story, wasn't it? Yes, we left him in the funny little house in the woods, with the clawy creature grabbing him. Now, what do you suppose that clawy creature was? Why, a great, big owl, to be sure, with round, staring, yellow eyes, and he had grabbed Uncle Wiggily in his claws, and pulled him inside the house. 'Now, I've got you!' cried the owl. 'I was just wishing some one would come along, and you did. Some of my friends are coming to tea this afternoon, and you'll do very nicely made up into sandwiches.' Wasn't that a perfectly dreadful way to talk about our Uncle Wiggily? Well, I guess yes! 'Now you're here, make yourself at home,' went on the owl, sarcastic-like, as he locked the front door and put the key in his pocket. 'Did you see the sign?' 'Yes,' said Uncle Wiggily, 'I did. But I don't call it fair. I thought I would find my fortune in here.' 'The sign says you'll be surprised, and I guess you are surprised, aren't you?' asked the owl. 'Yes,' answered the rabbit, 'very much so. But I'd rather have a nice surprise party, with peanuts and lemonade, than this.' 'No matter,' said the owl, snapping his beak like a pair of shears, 'here you are and here you'll stay! My friends will soon arrive. I'll now put the kettle on, to boil for tea.' Well, poor Uncle Wiggily didn't know what to do. He couldn't look in his valise to see if there was anything in it by which he might escape, for he had dropped the satchel outside when the owl grabbed him, and he only had his barber-pole crutch. 'Oh, this is worse and worse!' thought the poor old rabbit. But listen, Johnnie Bushytail is outside the owl's house, and he's going to do a wonderful trick. As soon as he saw the door shut on Uncle Wiggily, that brave squirrel boy began to plan how he could save him, and the first thing he did was to gather up a lot of acorns. Then he perched himself in a tree, right in front of the owl's door, and Johnnie began throwing acorns at it. 'Rat-a-tat-tat!' went the acorns on the wooden panels. 'Ha! Those must be my friends!' exclaimed the bad owl, opening the door a little crack so he could peek out, but taking care to stand in front of it, so that Uncle Wiggily couldn't slip out. But, of course, the owl saw no one. 'It must have been the wind,' he said as he shut the door. Then Johnnie Bushytail threw some more acorns at the door. 'Pitter-patter-patter-pit!' they went, like hailstones in an ice cream can. 'Ah, there are my friends, sure, this time!' thought the owl, and once more he peered out, but no one was there. 'It must have been a tree branch hitting against the door,' said the owl, as he sharpened a big knife with which to make the sandwiches. Then Johnnie threw some more acorns, and the owl now thought positively his friends were there, and when he opened it and saw no one he was real mad. 'Some one is playing tricks on me!' exclaimed the savage bird. 'I'll catch them next time!' Now this was just what Johnnie Bushytail wanted, so he threw a whole double handful of acorns at the door, and when the owl heard them pattering against the wood he rushed out. 'Now, I've got you!' he cried, but he hadn't, for Johnnie was up a tree. And, for the moment, the owl forgot about Uncle Wiggily, and there the door was wide open. 'Run out, Uncle Wiggily! Run out!' cried Johnnie, and out the old gentleman rabbit hopped, catching up his valise, and away into the woods he ran, with Johnnie scurrying along in the tree tops above him, and laughing at the owl, who flew back to his house, but too late to catch the bunny. 'That's what you get for fooling people so they'll come into your house,' called the squirrel boy. 'It serves you right, Mr. Owl. Come on, Uncle Wiggily, we'll get away from here.' So they went on together until it was time for Johnnie to go home, and he said he'd tell Uncle Wiggily's friends that he had met the old gentleman rabbit, and that he hadn't found his fortune yet, but that he was looking for it every minute, and had had many adventures. Well, Uncle Wiggily went on some more, for quite a distance, until it was noon time, and then he sat down in the cool, green woods, where there were some jacks-in-the-pulpit growing near some ferns, and there Uncle Wiggily ate his lunch of lettuce sandwiches, with carrot butter on them, and gnawed on a bit of potato. Just as he was almost through, he heard a rustling in the bushes, and a voice exclaimed: 'Oh, dear!' 'Why, what's the matter?' asked Uncle Wiggily, thinking perhaps an adventure was going to happen to him. 'Who are you?' 'Oh, dear!' exclaimed the voice again. Then, before the old rabbit could jump up and run away, even if he had wanted to, out from under a big bush came a little white poodle dog, with curly, silky hair. He walked right up to Uncle Wiggily, that dog did, and the rabbit wasn't a bit afraid, for the dog wasn't much bigger than he was, and looked very kind. 'What do you want, doggie?' gently asked Uncle Wiggily. The dog didn't answer, but he gave a little short bark, and then he began turning somersaults. Over and over he went, sometimes backward and sometimes frontward, and sometimes sideways. And when he was finished, he made a low bow, and walked around on his two hind legs, just to show he wasn't proud or stuck up. 'There!' exclaimed the poodle doggie. 'Is that worth something to eat, Mr. Rabbit?' 'Indeed it is,' answered Uncle Wiggily, 'but I would have given you something to eat without you doing all those tricks, though I enjoyed them very much. Where did you learn to do them?' 'Oh, in the circus where I used to be, I always had to do tricks for my dinner,' said the doggie. 'What is your name?' asked Uncle Wiggily. 'Fido Flip-Flop,' was the answer. 'You see they call me that because I turn so many flip-flops,' and then Uncle Wiggily gave him some lunch, and told the dog about how he, himself, was traveling all over in search of his fortune. 'Why, that's just what I'm doing, too,' exclaimed Fido Flip-Flop. 'Suppose we travel together? and maybe we'll each find a fortune.' 'That's just what we'll do,' agreed Uncle Wiggily. And then, all of a sudden, before you could open your eyes and shut them again, two savage foxes jumped out from behind a big stump. 'You grab the dog and I'll grab the rabbit,' called the biggest fox, and right at Uncle Wiggily and Fido they sprang, gnashing their teeth. But don't worry. I'll find a way to save them, and if the canary bird doesn't take my lead pencil and stick it in his seed dish I'll tell you in the following story about Uncle Wiggily doing some tricks. STORY V UNCLE WIGGILY DOES SOME TRICKS When those two savage ducks, oh, I mean foxes, when those two savage foxes jumped out of the bushes at Uncle Wiggily Longears and Fido Flip-Flop, as I told you in the other story, the rabbit and the poodle doggie didn't know what in the world to do. 'Run this way!' called Fido, starting off to the left. 'No, hop this way!' said Uncle Wiggily, hopping to the right. 'Stand right where you are!' ordered the two foxes together. And with that one made a grab for Uncle Wiggily. But what did that brave rabbit gentleman do but stick his red-white-and-blue crutch out in front of him, and the fox bit on that instead of on Uncle Wiggily. Right into the crutch the fox's teeth sank, and for a moment Uncle Wiggily was safe. But not for long. 'Ah, you fooled me that time, but now I'll get you!' cried the fox, and, letting go of the crutch, he made another grab for the rabbit. But at that instant Fido Flip-Flop, who had been jumping about, keeping out of the way of the fox that was after him, cried out quite loudly: 'Look here, everybody but Uncle Wiggily, and, as for you, shut both your eyes tight.' Now the old gentleman rabbit couldn't imagine why he was to shut his eyes tight, but he did so, and then what do you s'pose Fido Flip-Flop did? Why, he began turning somersaults so fast that he looked just like a pinwheel going around, or an automobile tire whizzing along. Faster and faster did Fido Flip-Flop turn around, and then, all of a sudden, he began chasing his tail, making motions just like a merry-go-round in a circus, until those two foxes were fairly dizzy from watching him. 'Stop! Stop!' cried one fox. 'Yes do stop! We're so dizzy that we can't stand up!' cried the other fox, staggering about. 'Stop!' 'No, I'll not!' answered Fido Flip-Flop, and he went around faster that ever, faster and faster and faster, until those two bad foxes got so dizzy-izzy that they fell right over on their backs, with their legs sticking straight up in the air like clothes posts, and their tails were wiggling back and forth in the dirt, like dusting brushes. Oh, but they were the dizzy foxes, though. 'Now's your chance! Run! Run! Uncle Wiggily! Run!' called Fido Flip-Flop 'Open your eyes and run!' So the old gentleman rabbit opened his eyes, took up his valise which he had dropped, and, hopping on his crutch, he and the poodle doggie ran on through the woods, leaving the two surprised and disappointed foxes still lying on their backs, wiggling their tails in the dust, and too dizzy, from having watched Fido Flip-Flop do somersaults, and chase his tail, to be able to get up. 'Why did you want me to shut my eyes?' asked Uncle Wiggily, when they were so far away from the foxes that there was no more danger. 'That was so  you  wouldn't get dizzy from watching me do the flip-flops,' answered the doggie. 'My, but that was a narrow escape, though. Have you had many adventures like that since you started out to seek your fortune?' 'Yes, several,' answered the rabbit. 'But turning flip-flops is a very good thing to know how to do. I wonder if you could teach me, so that when any more foxes or alligators chase me I can make them dizzy by turning around? Can you teach me?' 'I'm sure I can,' said Fido. 'Here, this is the way to begin,' and he did some flip-flops slow and easy-like. Then Uncle Wiggily tried them, and, though he couldn't do them very well at first, he practised until he was quite good at it. Then Fido showed him how to stand on one ear, and wiggle the other, and how to blink his eyes while standing on the end of his little tail, and then Uncle Wiggily thought of a new trick, all by himself. 'I'll stick my crutch in the ground, like a clothes pole,' he said to Fido, 'and then I'll hop up on it and sing a song,' which he did, singing a song that went like this:     'Did you ever see a rabbit        Do a flipper-flopper-flap?      If not just kindly watch me,        As I wear my baseball cap.     'It's very strange, some folks may say,        And also rather funny,      To see a kinky poodle dog        Play with a flip-flop bunny.     'But we are on our travels,        Adventures for to seek,      We may find one, or two, or three,        'Most any day next week.' And then Uncle Wiggily hopped down, and waved both ears backward and forward, and made a low bow to a make-believe crowd of people, only, of course, there were none there. 'Fine! Fine!' cried Fido Flip-Flop. 'That's better than I did when I was in the circus. Now I'll tell you what let's do.' 'What?' asked Uncle Wiggily. 'Let's go around and give little shows and entertainments, for little folks to see,' went on the poodle doggie. 'I can turn flip-flops, and you can stand on your head on your crutch, and sing a song, and then we'll take up a collection. I'll pass my hat, and perhaps we may make our fortune, who knows?' 'Who, indeed?' said Uncle Wiggily. 'We'll do it.' So off they started together to give a little show, and make some money, and, as they went on through the woods, they practised doing the tricks Uncle Wiggily had learned. Well, in a little while, not so very long, they came to a nice place in the forest, an open place where no trees grew. 'Here is a good spot for our show,' said Uncle Wiggily. 'But there is no one to see us do the tricks,' objected Fido. 'Oh, yes, there are some ants, and an angle worm, and a black bug and a grasshopper,' said Uncle Wiggily. 'They will do to start on, and after they see us do the tricks they'll tell other folks, and we'll have quite a crowd.' So they started in to do their tricks. Fido turned a lot of flip-flops, and Uncle Wiggily did a dance on the end of his crutch, and sang a song about a monkey-doodle, which the angle worm said was just fine, being quite cute, and the grasshopper made believe play a fiddle with his two hind legs, scratching one on the other, and making lovely music. But, all of a sudden, just as Uncle Wiggily was standing on his left ear, and wiggling his feet in the air, which is a very hard trick for a rabbit, what should happen but that out of the woods sprang two boys. 'There's the dog! Grab him!' cried one boy. 'Never mind about the rabbit! Get the trick dog!' And the boys rushed right up, knocking Uncle Wiggily down, and grabbing Fido Flip-Flop. And they started off through the woods with him, while Uncle Wiggily cried out for them to come back. But they wouldn't. Now please don't feel badly, for I'm going to tell you in the next story how Uncle Wiggily saved Fido, and also how the rabbit went to Arabella Chick's surprise party, that is I will if our automobile doesn't turn upside down, and break my ice cream cone. STORY VI UNCLE WIGGILY AT THE PARTY Well, when Uncle Wiggily Longears found that the elephant wouldn't get off his trunk, oh, listen to me! What I meant to say was, that when Uncle Wiggily saw those two boys running off with Fido Flip-Flop, the little trick dog, as I told you about in the story before this, the old gentleman rabbit was so surprised at first that he didn't know what to do. 'Won't you please come back with that little doggie?' begged Uncle Wiggily, but the bad boys kept right on. I guess they knew how smart Fido was, and they wanted to get up a show with him. Anyhow, they kept on running through the woods, holding him tightly in their arms. 'Oh, dear! This is terrible!' exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. 'I'll never get any good fortune if Fido has such bad luck. And it was partly my fault, too, for if we hadn't been doing tricks, we would have heard these boys coming, and could have run away. Well, now I must save Fido.' So Uncle Wiggily sat down on a stump, and thought, and thought, and thought of all the plans he could think of, to save the doggie from the two boys, and at last he decided the only way to do was to scare them. 'Then they'll drop Fido, and run away,' said the old gentleman rabbit. 'Let me see, how can I scare them? I know, I'll make believe I'm a tiger!' So what did that brave Uncle Wiggily do? but go to a mud hole, and with his crutch dipped into the mud, he made himself all striped over like a tiger that you see in a circus. Oh, he was a most ferocious sight when he finished decorating himself! Then he hid his satchel in the bushes, and he started off on a short cut through the woods, to get ahead of the boys. Faster and faster through the woods went Uncle Wiggily, and he looked so peculiarly terrifying that all the animals who saw him were scared out of their wits, and one old blue-jay bird was so frightened that he wiggled his tail up and down, and hid his head in a hollow tree. Well, by and by, after a while, Uncle Wiggily got to a place in the woods where he knew those boys, with Fido Flip-Flop, would soon come by. Then the rabbit hid himself in the bushes, so that his long ears wouldn't show. For he knew that if the boys saw them, they would know right away he wasn't a tiger, no matter if he was striped like one. In a few minutes along came the boys, and they were talking about what they were going to do to Fido, and how they would put him in a cage, and make him do lots of tricks. All of a sudden there was a rustling in the bushes, and Uncle Wiggily just stuck out his head and part of his body, laying his ears flat back where they could not be seen. But the boys could see the mud stripes, only they didn't know they were just mud, you understand. 'Oh! See that!' cried one boy. 'Yes, it's a tigery-tiger!' exclaimed the other boy. 'Let's run!' shouted both the boys together. 'The tiger will eat us up!' And just then Uncle Wiggily growled as loudly as he could, a real fierce growl, and he rattled the bushes and stuck out his striped paws, and those boys dropped Fido Flip-Flop, and ran away, as hard as they could through the woods, leaving Fido to join the rabbit. 'Thank you very much for saving me, Uncle Wiggily,' said the dog, as soon as he got over being frightened. 'That was a good trick, to pretend you were a tiger. But I knew you right away, only, of course, I wasn't going to tell those boys who you were. It served them right, for squeezing me the way they did. Now we'll go on, and see if we can find a fortune for you.' So they went back to where Uncle Wiggily had left his valise, and there it was safe and sound, and inside it were some nice things to eat, and the rabbit and doggie had a dinner there in the woods, after the mud stripes were washed off. Then they went on and on, for ever so long, and nothing happened, except that a mosquito bit Fido on the end of his nose, and every time he sneezed it tickled him. 'Well, I guess we won't have any more adventures to-day, Uncle Wiggily,' spoke the doggie, but, a moment later, they heard a rustling in the bushes and, before they could hide themselves, out jumped Arabella Chick, the sister of Charlie, the rooster boy. 'Oh, you dear Uncle Wiggily!' she exclaimed, 'you're just in time.' 'What for?' asked Uncle Wiggily; 'for the train?' 'No, for my party,' answered Arabella. 'I'm going to have one for all my friends, and I want you to come. Will you?' 'Oh, I guess so, Arabella. But you see, I have a friend with me, and, , ' 'Oh, he can come too,' spoke Arabella, making a bow to Fido Flip-Flop. So Uncle Wiggily introduced the doggie to the chickie girl, and the chickie girl to the doggie. Then they went on together to the party, which was held in a nice big chicken coop. Oh, I wish you could have been there! It was just too nice for anything! Sammie and Susie Littletail were there, and they were so glad to see Uncle Wiggily again. He said he hadn't been very lucky in finding his fortune so far, but his rheumatism was not much worse, and he was going to keep on traveling. He sent his love to all the folks, and said he'd be home some time later. Then, of course, all the other animal friends were at the party and they played games, games of all kinds, including a new one called 'Please don't sit on my hat, and I won't sit on yours.' It was too funny for anything, really it was. Then, of course, there were good things to eat. Buddy Pigg passed around the ice cream, and just as he was handing a plate of it to Jennie Chipmunk it slipped, I mean the ice cream slipped, and went right into Uncle Butter's lap. But the old goat didn't care a bit. He said it reminded him of a pail of paste, and he ate the ice cream, and Nurse Jane Fuzzy-Wuzzy got Jennie some more. Then Flip-Flop and Uncle Wiggily did some of their tricks, and every one said they were fine, and they thought it was the best party they had ever been at. But all of a sudden, just as they were playing the game called 'Jump on the piano, and play a queer tune,' there came a knock at the door. 'Who's there?' asked Arabella Chick. 'I am,' answered a voice, 'and I want Uncle Wiggily Longears instantly! He must come with me!' And they all looked from the window, and there stood a big dog, dressed up like a soldier, and he had a gun with him. And he wanted Uncle Wiggily to come out, and every one was frightened, for fear he'd shoot the old gentleman rabbit. But please don't you get alarmed. I wouldn't have that happen for worlds, and in the next story, if I catch a fish in the milk bottle, and he doesn't bite my finger, I'll tell you about Uncle Wiggily in a parade. And it will be a Decoration Day story. STORY VII UNCLE WIGGILY IN A PARADE Arabella Chick's party seemed to break up very suddenly when the guests saw that soldier-dog with the gun waiting outside the door. Buddy Pigg slipped out of a back window, and ran home with his tail behind him. Oh, excuse me, guinea pigs don't have a tail, do they? Anyhow he ran home, and so did Sammie and Susie Littletail, and Johnnie and Billie Bushytail, and the Wibblewobble children, and Peetie and Jackie Bow Wow too. But, of course, Arabella Chick couldn't run home because she was at home already, so she just looked out of the window once more, and there the dog-soldier stood, and he was looking in his gun to see if it was loaded. 'Well, is Uncle Wiggily coming out?' called the dog again. 'I guess I am, that is, are you sure you want me?' asked the poor old gentleman rabbit, puzzled like. 'Yes, of course I want you,' replied the dog. 'Then I guess I've got to go!' exclaimed Uncle Wiggily, as he looked for his crutch and valise. 'I guess this is the end of my fortune-hunting. Goodbye everybody!' And he felt so badly that two big tears rolled down his ears, I mean his eyes. Well, he bravely walked out of the door, and as he did so the dog-soldier, with the gun, exclaimed: 'Ah, here you are at last! Now hurry up, Uncle Wiggily, or we'll be late for the parade!' And, would you believe it? that dog was good, kind, old Percival, who used to be in a circus. And of course he wouldn't hurt the rabbit gentleman for anything. Percival just put his gun to his shoulder, and said: 'Come on, we'll get in the parade now.' 'Parade? What parade?' asked Uncle Wiggily. 'Oh my! how you frightened me!' 'Why the Decoration Day parade,' answered Percival. 'To-day is the day when we put flowers on the soldiers' graves, and remember them for being so brave as to go to war. All old soldiers march in the parade, and so do all their friends. I'm going to march, and I'm going to put flowers on a lot of soldiers' graves. I happened to remember that you were once in the war, so I came for you. I didn't mean to scare you. You were in the war, weren't you?' 'Yes,' said Uncle Wiggily, happy now because he knew he wasn't going to get shot, 'I once went to war, and killed a lot of mosquitoes.' 'Good! I thought so!' exclaimed Percival. 'Well, I met Grandfather Goosey Gander, and he said he thought you were at this party, so I came for you. Come on, now, the parade is almost ready to start.' 'Oh, how you did frighten us!' exclaimed Arabella, whose heart was still going pitter-patter. 'We thought you were going to hurt Uncle Wiggily, Percival.' 'Oh, I'm so sorry I alarmed you,' spoke the circus dog politely. 'I won't do it again.' Well, in a little while Percival and Uncle Wiggily were at the parade. The old gentleman rabbit left his satchel at Arabella's house, and only took his crutch. But he limped along just like a real soldier, and Percival carried his gun as bravely as one could wish. Oh, I wish you could have heard the bands playing, and the drums beating, the little kind that sound like when you drop beans on the kitchen oil-cloth, and the big drums, that go 'Boom-boom!' like thunder and lightning, and the fifes that squeak like a mouse in the cheese trap, and then the big blaring horns, that make a sound like a circus performance. They were all there, and there were lots of soldiers and horses and wagons filled with flowers to put on the graves of the soldiers, who were so brave that they didn't mind going to war to fight for their country, though war is a terrible thing. Then the march began, and Uncle Wiggily and Percival stepped out as brave as anyone in all the parade. Oh, how fine they looked! and, when they marched past, all the animal people, and some real boys and girls, and papas and mammas clapped their hands and cried 'Hurrah!' at the sight of the old gentleman rabbit limping along on his crutch, with the dog-soldier marching beside him. 'Who knows,' whispered Percival to Uncle Wiggily, 'who knows but what you may discover your fortune to-day?' 'Indeed I may,' answer Uncle Wiggily. 'Who knows?' Well, that was a fine parade. But something happened. I was afraid it would, but I'll tell you all about it, and you can see for yourself whether or not I was right. All of a sudden one man, with a big horn, a horn large enough to put a loaf of mother's bread down inside the noisy end, all of a sudden this man blew a terrible blast, 'Umpty-umpty-Umph! Umph!' My, what a noise he made on that horn. Now, right in front of this man was a little boy-duck riding on a pony. Yes, you've guessed who he was, he was Jimmy Wibblewobble. And when that man blew the loud blast, the pony was frightened, and ran away with Jimmie on his back. Faster and faster ran the pony, and Jimmie Wibblewobble clung to his back, fearing every moment he would be thrown off. In and out among the people and animals in the parade, in and out among trolley cars and automobiles, in and out, and from one side to another of the street ran the frightened pony. 'Oh, poor Jimmie will be killed!' cried Percival. 'No, he will not, for I will save him!' shouted Uncle Wiggily. So that brave rabbit ran right out to where he saw Munchie Trot, the little pony boy. 'Let me jump on your back, Munchie,' said Uncle Wiggily, 'and then we'll race after that runaway pony and grab off poor Jimmie. And run as fast as you can, Munchie!' 'I certainly will!' cried Munchie. So Uncle Wiggily got on Munchie's back, and away they started after the runaway pony. Faster and faster ran Munchie, and by this time the other little horsie was getting tired. Jimmie was still clinging to his back, and asking him not to run so fast, but the pony was so frightened he didn't listen to the duck-boy. Then, just as he was going to run into a hot peanut wagon, and maybe toss Jimmie off into the red-hot roaster, all at once Uncle Wiggily, on Munchie's back, galloped up alongside of the runaway pony. And as quick as you can drink a glass of lemonade, Uncle Wiggily grabbed Jimmie up on Munchie's back beside him, and so saved the duck-boy's life. And then the runaway pony stopped short, all of a sudden, and didn't bump into the hot peanut wagon, after all, and he was sorry he had run away, and scared folks. Then the Decoration Day parade went on, and everyone said how brave Uncle Wiggily was. But he hadn't yet found his fortune, and so in the story after this in case our front porch doesn't run away, and take the back steps with it, so I have to sleep on the doormat, I'll tell you about Uncle Wiggily in the fountain. STORY VIII UNCLE WIGGILY IN THE FOUNTAIN Well, after the Decoration Day parade, and the things that happened in it, such as the pony running away with Jimmie Wibblewobble, Uncle Wiggily Longears thought he'd like to go off to some quiet place and rest. 'Oh, can't you come with me?' asked Percival, the old circus dog. 'We'll go to the Bow-Wows house, and have something to eat.' 'No, I'm afraid I can't go,' replied the old gentleman rabbit. 'You see I must travel on to seek my fortune, for I haven't found it yet, and I still have the rheumatism.' 'Why don't you try to lose that rheumatism somewhere?' asked Percival. 'I would, if it's such a bother.' 'Oh, I've tried and tried and tried, but I can't seem to lose it,' replied Uncle Wiggily. 'So I think I'll travel on. I'm much obliged to you for letting me march in the parade.' Then the old gentleman rabbit got his valise, and, with his crutch, he once more started off. He went on and on, up one hill and down another, over the fields where the horses and cows and sheep were pulling up the grass, and chewing it, so the man wouldn't have to cut it with the lawn mower; on and on he went. Then Uncle Wiggily reached the woods, where the ferns and wild flowers grow. 'This is a fine place,' he said as he sat down on a flat stump. 'I think I will eat my dinner,' so he opened the satchel, and took out a sandwich made of yellow carrots and red beets, and very pretty they looked on the white bread, let me tell you; very nice indeed! Uncle Wiggily was eating away, and he was brushing the crumbs off his nose by wiggling his ears, when, all of a sudden, he heard a cat crying. Oh, such a loud cry as it was! 'Why, some poor kittie must be lost,' thought the old gentleman rabbit. 'I'll see if I can find it.' Then the cry sounded again, and, in another moment, out of a tree flew a big bird. 'Oh, maybe that bird stuck his sharp beak in the kittie and made it cry,' thought Uncle Wiggily. 'Bird, did you do that?' he asked, calling to the bird, who was flying around in the air. 'Did I do what?' asked the bird. 'Did you stick the kittie, and make it cry?' 'Oh, no,' answered the bird. 'I made that cat-crying noise myself. I am a cat-bird, you know,' and surely enough that bird went 'Mew! Mew! Mew!' three times, just like that, exactly as if a cat had cried under your window, when you were trying to go to sleep. 'Ha! That is very strange!' exclaimed the rabbit. 'So you are a cat-bird.' 'Yes, and my little birds are kittie-birds,' was the answer. 'I'll show you.' So the bird went 'Mew! Mew! Mew!' again, and a lot of the little birds came flying around and they all went 'Mew! Mew!' too, just like kitties. Oh, I tell you cat-birds are queer things! and how they do love cherries when they are ripe! Eh? 'That is very good crying, birdies,' said Uncle Wiggily, 'and I think I'll give you something to eat, to pay for it.' So he took out from his valise some peanuts, that Percival, the circus dog, had given him, and Uncle Wiggily fed them to the cat-bird and her kittie-birds. 'You are very kind,' said the mamma bird, 'and if we can ever do you a favor we will.' And now listen, as the telephone girl says, those birds are going to do Uncle Wiggily a favor in a short time, a very short time indeed. Well, after the birds had eaten all the peanuts they flew away, and Uncle Wiggily started off once more. He hadn't gone very far before he came to a fountain. You know what that is. It's a thing in a park that squirts up water, just like when you fill a rubber ball with milk or lemonade and squeeze it. Only a fountain is bigger, of course. This fountain that Uncle Wiggily came to had no water in it, for it was being cleaned. There was a big basin, with a pipe up through the middle, and this was where the water spouted up when it was running. 'This is very strange,' said Uncle Wiggily, for he had never seen a fountain before, 'perhaps I can find my fortune in here. I'll go look.' So down he jumped into the big empty fountain basin, which was as large as seven wash tubs made into one. And it was so nice and comfortable there, and so shady, for there were trees near it, that, before he knew it, Uncle Wiggily fell fast asleep, with his head on his satchel for a pillow. And then he had a funny dream. He dreamed that it was raining, and that his umbrella turned inside out, and got full of holes, and that he was getting all wet. 'My!' exclaimed Uncle Wiggily, as he gave a big sneeze. 'This is a very real dream. I actually believe I  am  wet!' Then he got real wide awake all of a sudden, and he found that he was right in the middle of a lot of wetness, for the man had turned the water on in the fountain unexpectedly, not knowing that the old gentleman rabbit was asleep there. 'I must get out of here!' cried Uncle Wiggily, as he grabbed up his valise and crutch. Then the water came up to his little short, stumpy tail. Next it rose higher, up to his knees. Then it rose still faster up to his front feet and then almost up to his chin. 'Oh, I'm afraid I'm going to drown!' he cried. 'I must get out!' So he tried to swim to the edge of the fountain, but you can't swim very well with a crutch and a valise, you know, and Uncle Wiggily didn't want to lose either one. Then the water from the top of the fountain splashed in his eyes and he couldn't see which way to swim. 'Oh, help! Help!' he cried. 'Will no one help me?' 'Yes, we will help you!' answered a voice, and up flew the big cat-bird, and her little kitten-birds. 'Quick, children!' she cried, 'we must save Uncle Wiggily, who was so kind to us! Every one of you get a stick, and we'll make a little boat, or raft, for him!' Well, I wish you could have seen how quickly the mamma cat-bird and her kittie-birds gathered a lot of sticks, and twigs, and laid them together crossways on the water in that fountain basin, until they had a regular little boat. Upon this Uncle Wiggily climbed, with his crutch and valise, and then the mamma cat-bird flew on ahead, and pulled the boat by a string to the edge of the fountain, where the rabbit could safely get out. So that's how the bunny was saved from drowning in the water, and in the next story, if a big, red ant doesn't crawl upon our porch and carry away the hammock, I'll tell you another adventure Uncle Wiggily had. It will be a story of the old gentleman rabbit and the bad dog. STORY IX UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE DOG Uncle Wiggily's rheumatism was quite bad after he got wet in the fountain, as I told you in the other story, and when he thanked the mamma cat-bird and her kitten-birds for saving him, he found that he could hardly walk, much less carry his heavy valise. 'Oh, we'll help you,' said Mrs. Cat-Bird. 'Here, Flitter and Flutter, you carry the satchel for Uncle Wiggily, and we'll take him to our house.' 'But, mamma,' said Flutter, who was getting to be quite a big bird-boy, 'Uncle Wiggily can't climb up a tree to our nest.' 'No, but we can make him a nice warm bed on the ground,' said the mamma bird. 'So you and Flitter carry the satchel. Put a long blade of grass through the handle, and then each of you take hold of one end of the grass in your bills, and fly away with it. Skimmer, you and Dartie go on ahead, and get something ready to eat, and I'll show Uncle Wiggily the way.' So Flitter and Flutter, the two boy birds, flew away with the satchel, and Skimmer and Dartie, the girl birds, flew on ahead to set the table, and put on the teakettle on the stove to boil, and Mrs. Cat-Bird flew slowly on over Uncle Wiggily, to show him the way. Well, pretty soon, not so so very long, they came to where the birds lived. And those good children had already started to make a nest on the ground for the old gentleman rabbit. They had it almost finished, and by the time supper was ready it was all done. Then came the meal, and those birds couldn't do enough for Uncle Wiggily, because they liked him so. When it got dark, they covered him all up, with soft leaves in the nest on the ground, and there he slept until morning. His rheumatism wasn't quite so bad when, after breakfast, he had sat out in the warm sun for a while, and after a bit he said: 'Well, I think I'll travel along now, and see if I can find my fortune to-day. Perhaps I may, and if I do I'll come back and bring you more peanuts.' 'Oh, that'll be fine and dandy!' cried Flitter and Flutter, and Skimmer and Dartie. So they said good-by to the old gentleman rabbit, and once more he started off. 'My! I'm certainly getting to be a great traveler,' he thought as he walked along through the woods and over the fields. 'But I don't ever seem to get to any place. Something always happens to me. I hope everything goes along nicely to-day.' But you just wait and see what takes place. I'm afraid something is going to happen very shortly, but it's not my fault, and all I can do is to tell you exactly all about it. Wait! There, it's beginning to happen now. All of a sudden, as Uncle Wiggily was traveling along, he came to a place in the woods where a whole lot of Gypsies had their wagons and tents. And on one tent, in which was an old brown and wrinkled Gypsy lady, there was a sign which read: FORTUNES TOLD HERE. 'Ha! If they tell fortunes in that tent, perhaps the Gypsy lady can tell me where to find mine,' thought Uncle Wiggily. 'I'll go up and ask her.' Well, he was just going to the tent when he happened to think that perhaps the Gypsy woman wouldn't understand rabbit talk. So he sat there in the bushes thinking what he had better do, when all at once, before he could wiggle his ears more than four times, a great big, bad, ugly dog sprang at him, barking, oh! so loudly. 'Come on, Browser!' cried this dog to another one. 'Here is a fat rabbit that we can catch for dinner. Come on, let's chase him!' Well, you can just imagine how frightened Uncle Wiggily was. He didn't sit there, waiting for that dog to catch him, either. No, indeed, and a bag of popcorn besides! Up jumped Uncle Wiggily, with his crutch and his valise, and he hopped as hard and as fast as he could run. My! How his legs did twist in and out. 'Come on! Come!' barked the first dog to the second one. 'I'm coming! I'm coming! Woof! Woof! Bow-w-w Bow-wow!' barked the second dog. Poor Uncle Wiggily's heart beat faster and faster, and he didn't know which way to run. Every way he turned the dogs were after him, and soon more of the savage animals came to join the first two, until all the dogs in that Gypsy camp were chasing the poor old gentleman rabbit. 'I guess I'll have to drop my satchel or my crutch,' thought Uncle Wiggily. 'I can't carry them much farther. Still, I don't want to lose them.' So he held on to them a little longer, took a good breath and ran on some more. He thought he saw a chance to escape by running across in front of the fortune-telling tent, and he started that way, but a Gypsy man, with a gun, saw him and fired at him. I'm glad to say, however, that he didn't shoot Uncle Wiggily, or else I couldn't tell any more stories about him. Uncle Wiggily got safely past the tent, but the dogs were almost up to him now. One of them was just going to catch him by his left hind leg, when one of the Gypsy men cried out: 'Grab him, Biter! Grab him! We'll have rabbit potpie for dinner; that's what we'll have!' Wasn't that a perfectly dreadful way to talk about our Uncle Wiggily? But just wait, if you please. Biter, the bad dog, was just going to grab the rabbit, when all of a sudden, Uncle Wiggily saw a big hole in the ground. 'That's what I'm looking for!' he exclaimed. 'I'm going down there, and hide away from these dogs!' So into the hole he popped, valise, crutch and all, and oh! how glad he was to get into the cool, quiet darkness, leaving those savage, barking dogs outside. But wait a moment longer, if you please. Biter and Browser stopped short at the hole. 'He's gone, gotten clean away!' exclaimed Browser. 'Isn't that too bad?' 'No, we'll get him yet!' cried Biter. 'Here, you watch at this hole, while I go get a pail of water. We'll pour the water down, under the ground where the rabbit is, and that will make him come out, and we'll eat him.' 'Good!' cried Browser. So while he stood there and watched, Biter went for the water. But, mind you, Uncle Wiggily had sharp ears and he heard what they were saying, and what do you think he did? Why, with his sharp claws he went right to work, and he dug, and dug, and dug in the back part of that underground place, until he had made another hole, far off from the first one, and he crawled out of that, with his crutch and valise, just as Biter was pouring the water down the first hole. 'Ah, ha! I think this will astonish those dogs!' thought Uncle Wiggily, and he took a peep at them from behind a bush where they couldn't see him, and then he hopped on through the woods, to look for more adventures, leaving the dogs still pouring water. And one happened to him shortly after that, as I shall tell you on the next page, when, in case the rocking chair doesn't tip over backwards and spill out the sofa cushion into the rubber plant, the story will be about Uncle Wiggily and the monkey. STORY X UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE MONKEY Let me see, we left those two bad dogs pouring water down the hole, to get Uncle Wiggily out, didn't we? And the old gentleman rabbit fooled them, didn't he? He got out of another hole that he dug around by the back door, you remember. Well, I just wish you could have seen those two dogs, after they had poured pail after pail of water down the hole, and no rabbit came floating up. 'This hole must go all the way down to China!' said Browser, breathing very fast. 'Yes, I'm tired of carrying water,' said Biter. And just then another dog cried out: 'Why, foolish dogs, the water's all running out the back way!' And, surely enough, it was. Then they knew Uncle Wiggily had escaped, and they were as angry as anything, but it served them right, I think. 'My! I wonder what will happen next?' thought the old gentleman rabbit, as he hopped along. 'That was a narrow escape.' So, having nothing else to do, Uncle Wiggily sat down on a nice, smooth stump, and he ate some lunch out of his valise. And a red ant came up, and very politely asked if she might not pick up the crumbs which the old rabbit dropped. 'Of course you may,' said Uncle Wiggily kindly. 'And I'll give you a whole slice of bread and butter, also.' 'Oh, you are too generous,' spoke the red ant. 'I never could carry a slice of bread and butter. But if you will leave it on the stump I'll get some of my friends, and we'll bite off little crumbs, a few at a time, and in that way carry it to our houses.' So that's what Uncle Wiggily did, and the ants had a fine feast, and they were very thankful. Uncle Wiggily asked them if they knew where he could find his fortune. 'Why don't you go to work, instead of traveling around so much?' asked the biggest red ant. 'The best fortune is the one you work for.' 'Is it? I never thought of that,' said Uncle Wiggily. 'I will look for work at once. I wonder if you ants have any for me.' 'We'd like to help you,' they said, 'but you see you are so large that you couldn't get into our houses to do any work. You had much better travel along, and work for some one larger than we are.' 'I will,' decided the old gentleman rabbit. 'I'll ask every one I meet if they want me to work for them.' So he started off once more, and the first place he came to was a house where a mouse lady lived. 'Have you any work I can do?' asked Uncle Wiggily politely. 'What work can you do?' asked the mouse lady. 'Well, I can peel carrots or turnips with my teeth,' said Uncle Wiggily, 'and I can look after children, and tell them stories, and I can do some funny tricks, , ' 'Then you had better go join a circus,' interrupted the mouse lady. 'I have no children, and I can peel my own carrots, thank you. As for turnips, I never eat them.' 'Then I must go on a little further,' said Uncle Wiggily, as he picked up his valise, and walked off on his crutch. So he went on, until he came to another house in the woods, and he knocked on the door. 'Have you any work I can do?' inquired Uncle Wiggily politely. 'No! Get away and don't bother me!' growled a most unpleasant voice, and the rabbit was just going down the steps, when the door opened a crack, and a long, sharp nose and a mouth full of sharp teeth, and some long legs with sharp claws on them, were stuck out. 'Oh, hold on!' cried the voice. 'I guess I can find some work for you after all. You can get up a dinner for me!' and then the savage creature, who had opened the door, made a grab for the rabbit and nearly caught him. Only Uncle Wiggily jumped away, just in time, and the wolf, for he it was who had called out, caught his own tail in the crack of the door and howled most frightfully. 'Come back! Come back!' cried the wolf, but, of course, Uncle Wiggily wouldn't do such a foolish thing as that, and the wolf couldn't chase after him, for his tail was fast in the door hinge. 'My, I must be more careful after this how I knock at doors, and ask for work,' the old gentleman rabbit thought. 'I was nearly caught that time. I'll try again, and I may have better luck.' So he walked along through the woods, and pretty soon he heard a voice singing, and this is the song, as nearly as I can remember it:     Here I sit and wonder     What I'm going to do.     I've no one to help me,     I think it's sad; don't you?     I have to play the fiddle,     But still I'd give a cent     To any one who'd keep the boys     From crawling in the tent. 'Well, I wonder who that can be?' thought Uncle Wiggily. 'He'll give a cent, eh? to any one who keeps the boys from crawling in the tent. Now, if that isn't a bear or a fox or a wolf maybe I can work for him, and earn that money. I'll try.' So he peeped out of the bushes, and there he saw a nice monkey, all dressed up in a clown's suit, spotted red, white and blue. And the monkey was playing a tune on a fiddle. Then, all of a sudden, he laid aside the fiddle, and began to beat the bass drum. Then he blew on a horn, next he jumped up and down, and turned a somersault, and then, finally, he grabbed up a whip with a whistle in the tail, I mean in the end, and that monkey began to pretend he was chasing make-believe boys from around a real tent that was in a little place under the trees. 'Oh, I guess that monkey won't hurt me,' said Uncle Wiggily as he stepped boldly out, and as soon as the monkey saw the rabbit, he called most politely: 'Well, what do you want?' 'I want to earn a cent, by chasing boys from out the tent,' replied Uncle Wiggily. 'Good!' cried the monkey. 'So you heard me sing? I'm tired of being the whole show. I need some one to help me. Come over here and I'll explain all about it. If you like it, you can go to work for me, and if you do, your fortune is as good as made.' 'That's fine!' cried Uncle Wiggily. 'And I can do tricks in the show, too.' 'Fine!' exclaimed the monkey, hanging by his tail from a green apple tree. 'Now, I'll explain.' But, just as he was going to do so, out jumped a big black bear from the bushes, making a grab for Uncle Wiggily. He might have caught him, too, only the monkey picked up a cocoanut pie off the ground and hit the bear so hard on the head, that the savage creature was frightened, and ran away, sneezing, leaving the monkey and the rabbit alone by the show-tent. 'Now, we'll get ready to have some fun,' said the monkey, and what he and Uncle Wiggily did I'll tell you in the following story which will be about the old gentleman rabbit and the boys, that is, if the molasses jug doesn't tip over on my plate, and spoil my bread and butter peanut sandwich. STORY XI UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BOYS 'Well,' said the monkey after the bear had run away. 'I guess we can now sit down and talk quietly together; eh, Uncle Wiggily?' 'Yes,' said the old gentleman rabbit. 'But what is it that you want me to do? I heard you sing that funny little song, about the boys coming in the tent. But I don't exactly understand.' 'That's just it,' replied the monkey. 'You see, it's this way. I have a little sort of a circus-show here, and the troublesome boys don't want to pay any money to get in. So when my back is turned they crawl under the tent, and so they see the show for nothing, just like at the circus.' 'Oh, so that's how it is?' asked Uncle Wiggily. 'And you want me to keep out the boys?' 'That's it,' said the monkey. 'Here's a big stick, with which to tickle the boys who crawl in under the tent without paying. Now I'll practice my tricks.' So the monkey did a lot of tricks. He stood on his head, and he hung by his tail, and he danced around in a circle. Then he pounded the drum, not so hard as to hurt it, but hard enough to make a noise, and he played the fiddle and blew on the horn, and then he ran inside the tent and jumped over a bench, making believe it was an elephant, and he did all sorts of funny tricks like that. He even stood on his head, and made a funny face. 'That will make a very nice show,' said Uncle Wiggily after he had watched the monkey. 'Now I'll stay outside, and keep the boys from coming in unless they pay their money. And you can be inside, doing the tricks.' 'And I'll give you money for working for me,' said the monkey. 'Then perhaps you can make your fortune, and, besides that, I'll give you a cocoanut, and you can make a cocoanut pie with it.' 'That will be fine!' cried Uncle Wiggily. So he and the monkey practiced to get ready for their show. It was a nice little tent in which it was to be given, and there were seats for the people, who would come, and a platform, and flying rings and trapeze bars and paper hoops, and all things like that, just the same as in a real circus. Well, finally the time came for the show. It was the day after Uncle Wiggily got to the place where the tent was, and he had slept that night in a hammock, put up between two trees. 'Now we're almost ready for the show,' said the monkey to the old gentleman rabbit, after a bit, 'so I hope you will be sure to keep out the troublesome boys. They always creep under the tent, and see the show for nothing. I can't have that going on if I'm to make any money.' 'Oh, I'll stop 'em!' declared Uncle Wiggily. 'And here's the club to do it with,' said the monkey, handing Uncle Wiggily a stick. 'Oh, I don't know about that,' answered the rabbit. 'I never hurt boys if I can help it. Perhaps I shan't need the club. I'll leave it here.' So Uncle Wiggily hid the club under an apple tree, but the monkey said it would be needed, and he wanted Uncle Wiggily to keep it, and take a whip, too. But the old rabbit shook his head. 'I'll try being kind to the boys,' he said. 'You let me have my way, Mr. Monkey.' Well, pretty soon, not so very long, the show began. The monkey went inside the tent, and he blew on the horn, and he made music on the fiddle, and sang a funny song about a little great big pussy, who had a red balloon. She stuck a pin inside it, and it played a go-bang! tune. Of course, as soon as the show started the people came crowding up to the tent, just as they do at the circus. There were men and women, and little boys and girls, and big boys and girls, and they all wanted to get inside to see what the monkey was doing. But, do you know, I believe all that he was doing was playing monkey-doodle tricks, but, of course, I might be mistaken. Well, as it always happens, some boys didn't have any money with which to pay their way inside the tent. And, of course, as it will sometimes happen, one boy said to another: 'Hey! I know a way we can crawl in under the tent, and see the show, and not have anything to pay.' 'But that wouldn't be fair,' spoke the other boy. 'It would be cheating, and there's nothing meaner in this world than to cheat, whether it's playing a baseball game or going to a circus.' 'I guess you're right,' said the first boy. 'What shall we do, though? I want to see the show.' 'Well, we must be fair, anyhow,' spoke the second boy. 'We can't crawl in under the tent, but perhaps if we ask the monkey to let us in for nothing he'll do it.' 'Very well, we will,' said the first boy. So they went up to the monkey and asked if they could go in for nothing, but, of course, he wouldn't let them. 'May we crawl in under the tent, then?' asked the second boy. 'If Uncle Wiggily will let you,' answered the monkey, blinking his two eyes and wrapping his tail around his neck. So those boys tried to crawl in under the tent, and as soon as Uncle Wiggily saw them he rushed up and cried out: 'Hey! Hold on there! Nobody must go under the tent. You must buy a ticket,' and he shook a feather at the boys and, instead of hitting them, he only tickled them, and didn't hurt them a bit, for they sneezed. Well, those boys were very troublesome. They kept on trying to crawl under the tent, and Uncle Wiggily rushed here, there and around the corner trying to stop them, and he cracked the lash on his whip, just like the man in the circus ring. But those boys kept on trying to crawl under the tent, for the monkey had given them permission, you see. So finally Uncle Wiggily said: 'I'll give those boys a little show myself, outside the tent, for nothing. Then maybe they'll stop bothering me.' So he stood on his left ear, and then on his right ear, and then he jumped through a hoop, and rolled over, and barked liked a dog, and all the boys that had tried to crawl under the tent to see the monkey-show for nothing, ran out to see Uncle Wiggily's show. And he did lots of tricks and kept them all from crawling in under the tent, and he even ate a popcorn ball, standing on his hind legs, and wiggling his left ear with a pin-wheel on it. Then, after a while, the monkey-show was all over, and the monkey said: 'Uncle Wiggily, you did very well. You treated those troublesome boys just fine! So I'll give you ten pennies, and perhaps they will make you have a good fortune.' Then the monkey gave Uncle Wiggily ten pennies, and he went to sleep in a feather bed, while the old gentleman rabbit went down to the drug store to get an ice cream soda. And what happened after the show was over, and what Uncle Wiggily did after he had his ice cream, I'll tell you in the next story which will be about Uncle Wiggily in a balloon. That is, if our pussy cat doesn't get all covered with red paint, and look like a tomato growing on a strawberry vine. So watch out, and don't let that happen. STORY XII UNCLE WIGGILY IN A BALLOON Well, just as I expected, something happened to my pussy-cat named Peter. He didn't fall into the pot of red paint, but he either ran away, or else some one took him. So now I have no pussy-cat. But I'll tell you a story about Uncle Wiggily just the same. The old gentleman rabbit stayed with the monkey for several days, and he was so kind and good to the troublesome boys, Uncle Wiggily was, I mean, and he did such funny tricks for them, that they didn't crawl under the tent any more, and the monkey could do his tricks in peace and quietness. 'Oh, you have been a great help to me,' said the monkey to the rabbit, 'and I would like you to work for me all Summer. I am now going to travel on to the next town, and if you like you may go with me and keep the boys there from crawling under the tent.' 'No, I thank you,' replied Uncle Wiggily slowly, as he put some bread and butter, and a piece of pie, into his satchel. 'I think I will travel farther on by myself, and seek my fortune.' 'Well, I'm sorry to see you go,' said the monkey. 'And here is fifty cents for your work. I hope you have good luck.' And then Uncle Wiggily started off again, over the fields and through the woods, seeking his fortune, while the monkey got ready to move his show to the next town. Well, for some time nothing happened to the old gentleman rabbit. He walked on and on, and once he saw a little red ant, trying to drag a piece of cake home for dinner. The cake was so big that the ant was having a dreadful time with it, but Uncle Wiggily took his left ear, and just brushed that cake into the ant's house as easily as anything. 'My, how strong and brave you are,' cried the little red ant. 'Won't you let me get you a glass of water?' 'I would like it,' said the rabbit, 'for it is quite warm to-day.' Well, that ant got Uncle Wiggily a glass of water, but you know how it is, an ant's glass is so very small that it only holds as much water as you could put on the point of a pin, and really, I'm not exaggerating a bit, when I say that Uncle Wiggily drank seventeen thousand four hundred and twenty-six and a half ant-glasses of water before he had enough. It took all the ants for a mile around to bring the water to him, but they didn't mind, because they liked him. Then the old gentleman rabbit traveled on again, and when it came night he slept under a haystack. 'I am sure I'll find my fortune to-day,' thought Uncle Wiggily as he got up and brushed the hay seed out of his ears the next morning. It was a bright, beautiful day, and he hadn't gone very far before he heard some fine music. 'My, there must be a hand-organ around here,' he said to himself. 'And perhaps there is another monkey. I'll watch out.' So he stood on his hind legs, Uncle Wiggily did, and the music played louder, and all of a sudden the rabbit looked down the road, and there was a nice circus, with the white tents, all covered with flags, and bands playing, and elephants squirting water through their long noses over their backs to wash the dust off. And lions and tigers were roaring, and the horses were running, and the fat lady was drinking pink lemonade, and Oh! it was fine! 'I've got fifty cents, and I guess I'll go to the circus,' thought Uncle Wiggily, and he was just entering the big tent when he happened to see a man with a lot of red and green and yellow and pink balloons. Now, you would have thought that man would have been happy, having so many balloons, but he wasn't. He looked very sad, that man did, and he was almost crying. 'Poor man!' thought Uncle Wiggily. 'Perhaps he has no money to go in the circus. I'll give him mine. Here is fifty cents, Mr. Man,' said the old gentleman rabbit, kindly. 'Take it and go see the elephant eat peanuts.' 'Oh, that is very good of you,' spoke the balloon man, 'but I don't want to go to the circus. I want to sell my balloons, but no one will buy them.' 'Why not?' asked the rabbit. 'Oh, because there are so many other things to buy,' said the man, 'red peanuts and lemonade in shells, oh, I've got that wrong, it is red lemonade, isn't it? And peanuts in shells. But no matter. What I need,' said the man, 'is to get the people to listen to me, I need to make them look at me, and when they see what fine balloons I have they'll buy some. But there are so many other things to look at that they never look toward me at all.' 'Ha! I know the very thing!' cried Uncle Wiggily. 'You ought to have some one go up in a balloon. That would surprise the people like anything. They'd be sure to look at that, and they'd all run over here and buy all your balloons.' 'Yes, but who can I get to go up in a balloon?' asked the man. 'I will!' cried Uncle Wiggily bravely. 'Perhaps I may find my fortune up in the sky, so I'll go in a balloon.' Well, the man thought that was fine. So he made a little basket for the rabbit to sit in, and he fastened the basket to a big red balloon, and then he took care of the rabbit's valise for him, while Uncle Wiggily got ready to go toward the clouds, taking only his crutch with him. When the man had everything fixed and when the rabbit was sitting in the basket as easily as in a soft chair at home, the man cried: 'Over here! Over here, everybody! Over here, people! A rabbit is going up in a balloon! A most wonderful sight! Over here!' And then the man let go of the balloon, and Uncle Wiggily shot right up toward the sky, only, of course, the man had a string fast to the balloon to pull it down again. Up and up went the balloon carrying Uncle Wiggily. Up and up! And my! how surprised the people were. They rushed over and bought so many balloons that the man couldn't take in the money fast enough. And Uncle Wiggily stayed up there, high in the air, looking for his fortune. And then, all of a sudden, a bad boy, with a bean shooter, shot at the balloon, and 'bang!' it burst, with a big hole in it. Down came Uncle Wiggily, head over heels, bursted balloon, basket, crutch and all. 'Oh, he'll be killed! He'll be killed!' cried all the people. 'No, he'll not! We'll save him!' cried Dickie and Nellie Chip-Chip, the boy and girl sparrow, who happened to be at the circus. 'We'll save Uncle Wiggily!' So up into the air they flew, and before Uncle Wiggily could fall to the ground Dickie and Nellie grabbed the basket in their bills, and, by fluttering their wings, they let it come very gently to earth just like a feather falling, and the rabbit wasn't hurt a bit. But, of course, the balloon was broken. So that's how Uncle Wiggily went up in a balloon and came down again, but he hadn't yet found his fortune. And now in the next story, if our fire shovel doesn't go out to play in the sand pile, and get its ears full of dirt, I'll tell you about Uncle Wiggily in an automobile. STORY XIII UNCLE WIGGILY IN AN AUTO Well, after Uncle Wiggily had been saved from the falling balloon by Dickie and Nellie Chip-Chip, the sparrow children, the people were so excited that they wanted the bad boy arrested for making a hole in the balloon with his bean-shooter. 'No, let him go,' said the rabbit gentleman, kindly. 'I'm sure he won't do it again.' And do you know, that boy never did. It was a good lesson to him. Then the people bought all the balloons, until the man had none left, and I guess if he could have sent for forty-'leven more he would have sold them also. 'I will pay you good wages to stay with me, and go up in a balloon every day,' said the man to the rabbit. 'You would help me do lots of business.' 'No,' said Uncle Wiggily. 'I must travel on and seek my fortune. I didn't find it up in the air.' But before the old gentleman rabbit traveled on, he went into the circus with Dickie and Nellie. For they had an extra ticket that Bully the frog was going to use, only Bully went in swimming and caught cold, and had to stay home. So Uncle Wiggily enjoyed the show very much in his place. 'Give my love to Sammie and Susie Littletail and to all my friends,' said the rabbit, as he took his crutch and valise, after the circus was over, and started to travel on, looking for his fortune. Well, the first place he came to that day was an old hollow stump, and on the door was a card which read: COME IN. 'Ha! Come in; eh?' said Uncle Wiggily. 'I guess not much! You can't fool me again. There is a bad bear, or a savage owl inside that stump, and they want to eat me. I'll just stay outside.' He was just hurrying past, when the door of the stump-house opened, and an old grandfather fox stuck out his head. This fox was almost blind, and he had no teeth, and he had no claws, and his tail was just like a last year's dusting brush, that the moths have eaten most up, and altogether that fox was so old and feeble that he couldn't have hurt a mosquito. So Uncle Wiggily wasn't a bit afraid of him. 'I say, is there anything good to eat out there?' asked the fox, looking over the tops of his spectacles at the rabbit. 'Anything nice and juicy to eat?' 'Yes, I am good to eat,' said Uncle Wiggily, 'but you are not going to eat me. Good-by!' 'Hold on!' cried the old fox, 'don't be afraid. I can only eat soup, for I have no teeth to chew with, so unless you are soup you are of no use to me.' 'Well, I'm not soup, but I know how to make some,' replied the rabbit, for he felt sorry for the grandfather fox. So what do you think our Uncle Wiggily did? Why, he went into the fox's stump-house and made a big pot full of the finest kind of soup, and the rabbit and the fox ate it all up, and, because the fox had no teeth or claws, he couldn't hurt his visitor. 'I wish you would stay with me forever,' said the old fox, as he blinked his eyes at Uncle Wiggily. 'I have a young and strong grandson coming home soon, and you might show him how to make soup.' 'No, thank you,' replied the rabbit. 'I'm afraid that young and strong grandson of yours would want to eat me instead of the soup, I guess I'll travel on.' So the old gentleman rabbit took his crutch and valise and traveled on. Well, pretty soon, it began to get dark, and Uncle Wiggily knew night was coming on. And he wondered where he could stay, for he didn't see any haystacks to sleep under. He was thinking that he'd have to dig a burrow in the ground for himself, and he was looking for a soft place to begin, when, all at once, he heard a loud 'Honk-Honk!' back of him in the road. 'Ha, an automobile is coming!' said Uncle Wiggily. 'I must get out of the way!' So he hopped on ahead, going down the road quite fast, until he got to a place where there were prickly briar bushes on both sides of the highway. 'My! I'll have to keep in the middle of the road if I don't want to get scratched,' said the rabbit. And then the automobile horn behind him honked louder than ever. 'They are certainly coming along fast,' thought Uncle Wiggily. 'If I don't look out I'll be run over.' So he hopped along quicker than before, until, all of a sudden, as he looked down the road, he saw a savage dog standing there. 'Well, now! Isn't that just my bad luck!' cried Uncle Wiggily. 'If I go on the dog will catch me, and if I stand here the auto will run on top of me. I just guess I'll run back and see if there is a hole where I can crawl through the bushes.' So he started to run back, but, no sooner had he done so, than the dog saw him, and came rushing at him with a loud, 'Bow-wow-wow! Bow-wow-wow!' 'My, but he's savage!' thought the rabbit. 'I wonder if I can get away in time?' And then the auto honked louder than before, and all of a sudden it came whizzing down the road, right toward the rabbit. 'Oh, dear; I'm going to be caught, sure!' cried Uncle Wiggily, and indeed it did look so, for there was the dog running from one direction, and the auto coming in the other, and prickly briar bushes were on both sides of the road, and Uncle Wiggily couldn't crawl through them without pulling all the fur off his back, and his ears, too. 'Honk-Honk!' went the auto. 'Bow-wow!' went the dog. 'Oh, dear!' cried Uncle Wiggily. Then he thought of a plan. 'I'll give a big run and a long jump and maybe I can jump over the auto, and then the auto will bump into the dog, and I will be safe!' he cried. So he took a long run, and just as the auto was going to hit him, Uncle Wiggily gave a big jump, right up into the air. He didn't jump quite quickly enough, however, for one of the big rubber tires ran over his toe, but he wasn't much hurt. And what do you think he did? Why, he landed right in the auto, on the seat beside a little boy. And that dog was so frightened of the automobile that he howled and yowled, and his teeth chattered, and he tucked his tail between his legs, and ran home. 'Oh, the bunny! The bunny!' cried the little boy, as he saw Uncle Wiggly. 'May we keep him, papa?' 'I guess so,' said the boy's papa. 'Anyhow his foot is hurt, and we'll take care of him until it gets well. My, but he is a good jumper, though!' So the man stopped the auto, and picked up Uncle Wiggily's crutch and valise, which the old gentleman rabbit had dropped when he jumped upon the seat beside the boy, and then the car went on. And Uncle Wiggily wasn't a bit frightened at being in an auto, for he knew the boy and man would be kind to him. 'Perhaps I shall find my fortune now,' the rabbit gentleman said. And the little boy patted him on the back, and stroked his long ears. Now, in the story after this I'll tell you what happened to Uncle Wiggily at the little boy's house, and in case our door key doesn't get locked out, and have to sleep in the park, you are going to hear about Uncle Wiggily in a boat. STORY XIV UNCLE WIGGILY IN A BOAT 'Poor rabbit!' exclaimed the little boy in the automobile, as he rubbed Uncle Wiggily's ears. 'I wonder if his foot is much hurt, papa?' 'I don't know,' answered the man, as he steered the machine down the road. 'I'll have the doctor look at it.' 'Oh, indeed, it isn't hurt much,' spoke up Uncle Wiggily. 'The rubber tire was soft, you see. But my rheumatism is much worse on account of running so fast.' 'What's this? Well, of all things! This rabbit can talk!' cried the man in surprise. 'Of course he can, papa,' said the boy. 'Lots of rabbits can talk. Why, there's Sammie and Susie Littletail; they can talk, and maybe this rabbit knows them.' 'I'm their uncle,' said the old gentleman rabbit, making a bow. 'Oh, then, you must be Uncle Wiggily Longears!' cried the little boy. 'Oh, I've always wanted to see you, and now I can!' 'Well, it is very strange to meet you this way,' said the man. 'Still, I am glad you are not hurt, Uncle Wiggily. And so you are out seeking your fortune,' for the rabbit had told them about his travels. 'Perhaps you would like to rest at our house for a few days. We can give you a nice room, with a brass bed, and a bath-tub to yourself, and you can have your meals in bed, if you can't come down stairs.' 'Oh, I am not used to that kind of a life,' said the old gentleman rabbit. 'I would rather live out of doors. If you can get me some clean straw to lie on, and once in a while a carrot or a turnip, and a bit of lettuce and some cabbage leaves now and then, I'll be all right. And as soon as my foot is well I'll travel on.' 'Oh, what good times we'll have!' cried the little boy. 'Our house is near a lake, and I have a motor boat. And I'll give you a ride in it.' Well, Uncle Wiggily thought that would be nice, and he was rather glad, after all, that he had jumped into the auto. So pretty soon they came to the place where the boy lived. Oh, it was a fine, large house, with lots of grounds, lawns and gardens all around it. And there were several dogs on the place, but the little boy spoke to them all, telling them that the rabbit was his friend Uncle Wiggily, who must not be bitten or barked at on any account. 'Oh, we heard about him from Fido Flip-Flop,' said big dog Rover. 'We wouldn't hurt Uncle Wiggily for two worlds, and part of another one, and a bag of peanuts.' So Uncle Wiggily was given a nice bed of straw in one of the empty dog-houses, and the boy got him some cabbage and lettuce, and the rabbit made himself a sandwich of them, with some bread and butter which he had in his satchel. Then the rabbit and the dogs talked together, and the rabbit told of his travels, and what had happened to him so far. 'Wonderful! Wonderful!' exclaimed the old dog Rover. 'You should write a book about your fortune.' 'I haven't found it yet, but perhaps I may, and then I'll write the book,' said Uncle Wiggily, combing out his whiskers. That night the boy put a soft rag and some salve on the rabbit's sore foot, and he also gave him some liniment for his rheumatism, and in the morning Uncle Wiggily was much better. He and the boy and the dogs had lots of fun playing together on the smooth, green, grassy lawn. They played tag, and hide-and-go-seek, and a new game called 'Don't Let the Ragman Take Your Rubber Boots.' And the dog Rover pretended he was the ragman. 'Now, then, we'll all go out in my motor boat,' said the boy, so he and Uncle Wiggily and the dogs went down to the lake and, surely enough, there was the boat, the nicest one you could wish for. There was a little cabin in it, and seats out on deck, and a little engine that went 'choo-choo!' and pushed the boat through the water. In the boat they all had a fine ride around the lake, which was almost like the one where you go to a Sunday-school picnic, and then it was time for dinner. And, as a special treat, when they got on shore, Uncle Wiggily was given carrot ice cream, with chopped-up turnips in it. And oh, how good it was to him! Well, the days passed, and Uncle Wiggily was getting so he could walk along pretty well, for his foot was all cured, and he began to think of going on once more to seek his fortune. And then something happened. One day the boy went out alone in a rowboat to see if he could find any fish. And before he knew it his boat had tipped over, spilling him out into the water, and he couldn't swim. Wasn't that dreadful? 'Oh! Help! Help!' he cried, as the water came up to his chin. My, but it's awful to be tipped over in a boat! and I and I hope if you can't swim you'll never go out in one alone. And there was that poor boy splashing around in the water, and almost drowned. 'Save me! Save me!' the boy cried. 'Oh, save me!' Well, as it happened, Uncle Wiggily was walking along the shore of the lake just then. He saw the little boy fall out of the boat, and he heard him cry. 'I'll save you if I can!' exclaimed the brave old rabbit. 'Come on, Rover, we'll go out in the motor boat and rescue him.' 'Bow-wow! Bow-wow! Sure! Sure!' cried Cover, wagging his tail. So he and Uncle Wiggily ran down, and jumped into the motor boat. And they knew just how to start the engine and run it, for the boy had showed them. 'Bang-bang!' went the engine. 'Whizz-whizz!' went the boat through the water. 'Faster! Faster!' cried Uncle Wiggily, who was steering the boat, while Rover ran the engine. 'Go faster!' So Rover made it go as fast as he could, and then all of a sudden that boy went down under the water, out of sight. 'Oh, he's drowned!' cried Uncle Wiggily sorrowfully. But he wasn't, I'm glad to say. Just then along came Nurse Jane Fuzzy-Wuzzy, the muskrat, swimming. And she dived away down under and helped bring that boy up to the top of the water, and then Uncle Wiggily and Cover grabbed him as the muskrat lifted him up, and they pulled him into the motor boat, and so saved his life. And oh! how thankful he was when he was safe on shore, and he was careful never to fall in the water again. Now, in case the clothes wringer doesn't squeeze all the juice out of my breakfast orange, I'll tell you in the next story about Uncle Wiggily making a cherry pie. STORY XV UNCLE WIGGILY MAKES A PIE Do you remember the little boy whom Uncle Wiggily helped save after he fell out of the boat? Well, that boy's papa was so glad because Uncle Wiggily had helped save the little chap from drowning that he couldn't do enough for the old gentleman rabbit. 'You can stay here forever, and have carrot ice cream every day if you like,' the man said. 'Oh, thank you very much, but I think I'll travel on,' replied Uncle Wiggily. 'I have still to seek my fortune.' 'Why,  I  will give you a fortune!' said the boy's papa. 'I will give you a thousand million dollars, and a penny besides.' 'That would be a fine fortune,' spoke the rabbit, 'but I would much rather find my own. It is no fun when you get a thing given to you. It is better to earn it yourself, and then you think more of it.' 'Yes, that is so,' said the man. 'Well, we will be sorry to see you go.' Uncle Wiggily started off the next day, once more to seek his fortune, and the little boy felt so sad at seeing him go that he cried, and put his arms around the old gentleman rabbit, and kissed him between the ears. And Uncle Wiggily felt badly, too. Well, the old gentleman rabbit traveled on and on for several days after that, sleeping under hay stacks part of the time, or in empty hollow stumps, and sometimes he dug a burrow for himself in the soft ground. And one afternoon, just as the sun was getting ready to go to bed for the night, Uncle Wiggily came to an open place in the woods where there was a cave, made of a lot of little stones piled up together. 'My! I wonder who lives there?' thought the rabbit. 'It is too small for a giant to live in, but there may be a bad bear or a savage fox in there. I guess I'd better get away from here.' Well, Uncle Wiggily was just going, when, all at once, a voice cried out: 'Here, hold on there!' The rabbit looked back, and he saw a great big porcupine, or hedgehog, you know, those animals like a big gray rabbit, only their fur is the stickery-prickery kind, like needles, and the quills come out and stick in anybody who bites a hedgehog. So I hope none of you ever bite one. And they won't bite you if you don't bother them. So as soon as Uncle Wiggily saw that it was Mr. Hedgehog who was speaking he wasn't a bit afraid, for he knew him. 'Oh, it's you, is it?' asked the rabbit. 'I'm real glad to see you. I was going to travel on, but, , ' 'Don't say another word!' cried the hedgehog heartily. 'You can stay in my cave all night. I have two beds, and it's a good thing I have, for if you slept with me you might get full of my stickery-stickers.' 'Yes, I guess I had better sleep alone,' said Uncle Wiggily, with a laugh. 'But it seems to me, Mr. Hedgehog, that you are not looking well.' 'I'm not,' answered the porcupine, as he shivered so that several of his quills fell out on the grass. 'I'm suffering for some cherry pie. Oh, cherry pie! If I only had some I know I'd feel better at once. I just love it!' 'Why don't you make some yourself?' asked Uncle Wiggily. 'I have tried,' replied the hedgehog. 'I've tried and tried again, but, somehow, it never comes out right. Here, I'll show you. I made a cherry pie just before I looked out of the door and saw you. I'll show it to you.' He went into his little stone house, and Uncle Wiggily went with him. 'There's the pie, it's no good!' cried the porcupine, as he pointed to something on the table. Well, as soon as Uncle Wiggily saw it he laughed so hard that his ears waved back and forth. 'What's the matter? I don't see anything funny,' asked Mr. Hedgehog, shivering so that more quills fell out. 'Why, you've gone and put the cherry pits into the pie instead of the cherries,' said the rabbit. 'That's no way to do. You must take out the stones from inside the cherries and put the outside part of them inside the pie, and throw the inside or stony part of the cherries away.' 'Oh, good land!' cried the hedgehog, 'no wonder I couldn't eat the pie. You see, I thought cherries were like peanuts. For you know you throw away the outside part of the peanut, and eat the inside.' 'Yes, and cherries are just the opposite,' said the rabbit, laughing again. 'For you eat the outside of a cherry and throw away the pit or stone that is inside. Now, I'll make you a cherry pie.' 'I wish you would,' said the porcupine. 'I'll go get the cherries.' So he went out in the orchard, and he shot his sharp stickery quills, like little arrows at the cherries on the tree, and they fell down, so he could pick them up in a basket. I mean the cherries fell down, though of course the quills did also though the hedgehog didn't pick them up. And while he was doing that Uncle Wiggily was making the pie crust. He took flour and lard and water, and mixed them together, and then he put in other things, Oh, well, you just ask your mamma or the cook what they were, for I might get it wrong, and soon the pie crust was ready. Then Uncle Wiggily built a hot fire in the stove, and he waited for Mr. Hedgehog to come in with the cherries. And pretty soon the porcupine came back with his basket full, and he and Uncle Wiggily shelled the peanuts, I mean the cherries, taking out the pits. 'Now I'll put them in the pie, and put sugar on them, bake it in the oven, and soon it will be done, and we can eat it,' said the rabbit. 'Oh, joy!' cried the hedgehog. 'That will be fine!' So Uncle Wiggily put the cherries in the pie, and threw the pits away, and he put the pie in the oven, and then he and Mr. Hedgehog sat down to wait for it to bake. And oh, how delicious and scrumptious it did smell! if you will excuse me for saying so. Well, in a little while, the pie was baked, and Uncle Wiggily took it from the oven. 'I can hardly wait to eat it!' cried the hedgehog, and just then there came a terribly loud knock on the door. 'Oh, maybe it's that bad fox come for some of my pie!' exclaimed the hedgehog. 'If it is, I'll stick him full of stickery-stickers.' But when he went to the door there stood old Percival, the circus dog, and he was crying as hard as he could cry. 'Come in,' invited Uncle Wiggily. 'Come in, and have some cherry pie, and you'll feel better.' So Percival came in, and they all three sat down, and ate the cherry pie all up, and sure enough Percival did feel better, and stopped crying. Then the circus dog and Uncle Wiggily stayed all night with Mr. Hedgehog, and they had more cherry pie next day, and it was very fine and sweet. Now, if our cook makes some nice watermelon sandwiches, with maple syrup on them, for supper, I'll tell you in the next story about Uncle Wiggily and old dog Percival, and why Percival cried. STORY XVI UNCLE WIGGILY AND PERCIVAL Now I'm going to tell you, before I forget it, why old dog Percival was crying that time when he came to the little stone house where the hedgehog lived, and where Uncle Wiggily gave him some cherry pie. And the reason Percival was crying, was because he had stepped on a sharp stone, and hurt his foot. 'But I don't in the least mind now,' said Percival, after he had eaten about sixty-'leven pieces of the pie. 'My foot is all better.' 'I should think that cherry pie would make almost any one better,' said the hedgehog, laughing with joy, for he felt better, too. 'I know some bad boys to whom I'm going to give some cherry pie, and I hope it makes them better. And to think I threw away the good part of the cherries and cooked the stones in the pie. Oh, excuse me while I laugh again!' And the hedgehog laughed so hard that he spilled some of the red cherry pie juice on his shirt front, but he didn't care, for he had another shirt. Well, Uncle Wiggily and Percival, the old circus dog, stayed for some days at the home of the hedgehog, and they had cherry pie, or fritters with maple syrup, at almost every meal. Then, finally, Uncle Wiggily said: 'Well, I guess I must travel on. I can't find my fortune here. I must start off to-morrow.' 'And I'll go with you,' spoke Percival. 'We'll go together, and see what we can find.' Well, he and Uncle Wiggily went on together for some time, and nothing happened, except that they met a poor pussy cat without any tail, and Uncle Wiggily gave her some of the pie. And the next day they met a cat and seven little kittens, and they all had tails, so they had to have some pie, too. But one night, after Percival and Uncle Wiggily had been traveling all day, they came to a deep, dark, dismal woods. 'Oh, have we got to go through that forest?' asked the old gentleman rabbit, wrinkling up his ears, I mean his nose. 'I guess we have,' replied the circus dog. 'We may find our fortunes in there.' 'It is a pretty dark spot to look for money, or fortunes,' said the rabbit. 'The best thing we can do is to look for a place to sleep, and in the morning we will hurry out of the woods.' Well, the two animal friends started into the grove of trees, and they hadn't gone very far before it got so dark that they couldn't see to go any farther. Oh, but it was black and lonesome and sort of scary-like! and Uncle Wiggily said: 'Let's stay here, Percival. We'll make a little bed under the trees to sleep in, and we'll build a fire to keep us warm, and cook a little supper.' So Percival thought that would be nice, and soon he and the rabbit had a cheerful little fire blazing, and then it wasn't quite so lonely. Only there was a big owl in a tree, and he kept hollering 'Who? Who? Who?' and Percival thought it meant him, and Uncle Wiggily thought it meant him, and they were rather frightened, so they didn't either of them answer the owl, who kept on calling 'Who? Who? Who?' They were just cooking their supper, and cutting up the cherry pie, and putting it on some oak leaves for plates, and they had picked out a nice smooth stump for a table, when, all of a sudden, they heard a voice saying: 'Now you make a jump and grab the rabbit and I'll take the dog. Then we can carry them off to our dens, and that will be the last of them. Get ready now!' 'Did you hear that?' asked Uncle Wiggily of the circus dog. 'Indeed I did,' replied Percival. 'I wonder if it can be those owls?' 'It doesn't sound like them,' said Uncle Wiggily. 'I think it is a bad fox, or maybe two of them.' And just then they looked off through the woods, and by the light of the fire they saw two big, savage, ugly wolves. Oh, how their sharp teeth gleamed in the dancing flames, and how red their tongues were! 'Come on! Grab 'em both!' cried one savage wolf. 'Grab the rabbit and the dog!' 'Sure! I'm with you!' growled the other savage wolf. 'Oh, what shall we do, Uncle Wiggily?' asked Percival. 'They'll eat us up! 'Let me think a minute,' said the rabbit. So he thought for maybe half a minute, and then exclaimed: 'Oh! I know a good thing to do.' 'What?' asked Percival. 'Say it quickly, Uncle Wiggily, for those wolves are creeping up on us, and it's so dark we can't see to run away.' And surely enough, those wolves were sneaking up, with their red tongues hanging out longer than ever, for all the world just as if they had eaten cherry pie. 'We must do some funny tricks!' exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. 'You know how, Percival, for you were once in a circus, and I learned some when I was with the monkey, and with Fido Flip-Flop. Do some tricks, and maybe these wolves will feel so good-natured that they won't bite us.' So brave Uncle Wiggily stood up on one ear and waved his feet in the air. Then he stood on his nose and turned a somersault. Next he went around and around as fast as a pinwheel, and he whistled a funny tune about a little rubber ball that flew into the air, and when it landed on the ground it would not stay down there. But I wish you could have seen the tricks Percival did. He jumped through between Uncle Wiggily's long ears, and he walked on his hind legs, and on his front ones. Then he stood on his head, and he made believe he was begging for something to eat, and Uncle Wiggily fed him a carrot, and a piece of pie. Then he put a piece of bread on his nose, tossed it up into the air, tossed the bread, I mean, not his nose, and when it came down he caught it and ate it. Oh, it was great! Well, those wolves were too surprised for anything. They had never seen tricks like those. First they smiled a bit. Then they smiled some more. Then one laughed, then the other laughed, and finally, when Uncle Wiggily and Percival took turns jumping over each other's backs, the wolves thought it so funny that they had to lie down on the leaves and roll over and over because they were laughing so hard. And, of course, after that they didn't feel like hurting Uncle Wiggily or Percival. And just then the big alligator came along and chased the wolves away, so the rabbit and dog had no one to bother them except the alligator, and, as he had just had his supper, he wasn't hungry, so he didn't eat them. So Uncle Wiggily and Percival went to sleep, and so must you, and if the vegetable man brings me a pumpkin Jack o' Lantern, with a pink ribbon on the end of the stem, I'll tell you in the next story about Uncle Wiggily in a well. STORY XVII UNCLE WIGGILY IN A WELL Well, I didn't get the pumpkin Jack o' Lantern with the pink ribbon on, but some one mailed me an ice cream cone, so it's just as well. That is, I suppose it was an ice cream cone when it started on its journey, but when I got it there was only the cone part left. Maybe the postman took out the ice cream, with which to stick a stamp on the letter. But there, I must tell you what happened to Uncle Wiggily after he and Percival did those tricks, and made the wolves laugh so hard. The rabbit and the circus dog stayed in the woods all that night, and nothing bothered them. 'Now, Percival, you make the coffee, and I'll spread the bread and butter for breakfast,' said Uncle Wiggily the next morning. 'Where are you going to get the bread and butter?' asked the dog. 'Oh, I have it in my satchel,' spoke the old rabbit, and, surely enough, he did have several large, fine slices. So he and Percival ate their breakfast, and then they started off again. They hadn't gone very far before they met a grasshopper, who was limping along on top of a fence rail, and looking quite sad, I mean the grasshopper was looking sad, not the fence rail. 'What is the matter?' asked Uncle Wiggily, kindly. 'Are you sad and lonesome because you can't have some cherry pie, or some bread and butter; or because you can't see any funny tricks? If you are, don't worry, Mr. Grasshopper, for Percival and I can give you something to eat, and also do some tricks to make you laugh.' 'No, I am not sad about any of those things,' replied the grasshopper, 'but you see I gave a big jump over a large stone a little while ago, and I sprained my left hind leg. Now I can't jump any more, and here it is Summer, and, of course, we grasshoppers have to hop, or we don't make any money.' 'Oh, don't let a little thing like that worry you,' spoke Uncle Wiggily. 'I have some very nice salve, that a gentleman and his boy gave me when their automobile ran over me, and it cured my sore toe, so I think it will cure your left hind leg.' Then he put some salve on the grasshopper's leg, and in a little while it was much better. 'Now we must travel on again, to seek our fortune,' said Uncle Wiggily. 'Come, Percival.' 'I will just do one little trick, to make the grasshopper feel better before we leave,' said the circus dog, so he stood up on the end of his tail, and went around and around, and winked first one eye and then the other, it was too funny for anything, really it was. Well, the alligator laughed at that, oh there I go again, I mean the grasshopper laughed, and then Uncle Wiggily and Percival went off together, very glad indeed that they had had a chance to do a kindness, even to a grasshopper. Pretty soon they came to a place where there were two roads branching off, one to the right hand and the other to the left, like the letter 'Y.' 'I'll tell you what we'll do,' said Percival, 'you go to the right, Uncle Wiggily, and I'll go to the left, and, later on, we'll meet by the mill pond, and perhaps each of us may have found his fortune by that time.' 'Good!' cried Uncle Wiggily. 'We'll do it!' So he went off one way, and the circus dog took the other path through the woods, and now I must tell you what happened to the old gentleman rabbit. Uncle Wiggily went along for some time, and just as he got to a place where there was a large stone, all of a sudden out popped a big fat toad. And it wasn't a nice toad, either, but a bad toad. 'Hello, Uncle Wiggily,' said the squatty-watty toad. 'I haven't seen you in some time. I guess you must be getting pretty old. You can't jump as good as you once could, can you?' 'Of course, I can,' exclaimed the rabbit, a bit pettish-like, for he didn't care to have even a toad think he couldn't jump as well as ever he could. 'I'd like to see you,' went on the toad. 'See if you jump from here over on that pile of leaves,' and he pointed to them with his warty toes. 'I'll do it,' exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. So he laid aside his crutch and his valise, gave a little run and a big jump, and then he came down kerthump on the pile of leaves. But wait. Oh! I have something sad to tell you. That toad was only playing a trick on the rabbit, and those leaves were right over a big, deep, dark well. And as soon as Uncle Wiggily landed on the leaves he fell through, for there were no boards under them to cover up the well, and down, down, down he went, and if there had been water in the well he would have been drowned. But the well was dry, I'm glad to say. Still Uncle Wiggily had a great fall, almost like the tumble of Humpty-Dumpty. 'Ah, ha!' exclaimed the mean, squatty-squirmy toad. 'Now you are in the well, and I'm going off, and tell the wolves, so they can come and get you out, and eat you. Ah, ha!' Oh! but wasn't that toad a most unpleasant one? You see, he used to work for the wolves, doing all sorts of mean things for them, and trapping all the animals he could for them. So off the toad hopped, to call the wolves to come and get Uncle Wiggily, and the poor rabbit was left alone at the bottom of the well. He tried his best to get up, but he couldn't. 'I guess I'll have to stay here until the wolves come,' he thought, sadly. 'But I'll call for help, and see what happens.' So he called: 'Help! Help! Help!' as loudly as he could. And all of a sudden a voice answered and asked: 'Where are you?' 'In the well,' shouted Uncle Wiggily, and he was afraid it was the wolves coming to eat him. But it wasn't, it was the limpy grasshopper, and he tried to pull Uncle Wiggily out of the well, but, of course, he wasn't strong enough. 'But I'll get Percival, the circus dog, and he'll pull you out before the wolves come,' said the grasshopper. 'Now I have a chance to do you a kindness for the one you did me.' So he hopped off, as his leg was nearly all better, and he found Percival on the left road and told him what had happened. And, my! how that circus dog did rush back to help Uncle Wiggily. And he got him out of the well in no time, by lowering a long rope to him, and pulling the rabbit gentleman up, and then the rabbit and dog ran away, before the toad could come back with the savage wolves, who didn't get any supper out of the well, after all, and it served them right. So that's all of this story, but I have some more, about the adventures of Uncle Wiggily, and next, in case the load of hay doesn't fall on my puppy-dog, and break off his curly tail, I'll tell you about Uncle Wiggily and Jennie Chipmunk. STORY XVIII UNCLE WIGGILY AND JENNIE CHIPMUNK After Uncle Wiggily had been pulled up out of the well by Percival, the old circus dog, and they had run far enough off so that the wolves couldn't get them, the rabbit and the grasshopper and Percival sat down on the ground to rest. For you see Uncle Wiggily was tired from having fallen down the well, and the grasshopper was tired from having run so fast to call back Percival, and of course Percival was tired from having pulled up the old gentleman rabbit. So they were all pretty well tired out. 'I'm sure I can't thank you enough for what you did for me,' said Uncle Wiggily to Percival, and the grasshopper. 'And as a little treat I'm going to give you some cherry pie that I made for the hedgehog.' So they ate some cherry pie, and then they felt better. And they were just going to travel on together again, when, all at once, there was a rustling in the bushes, and out flew Dickie Chip-Chip, the sparrow boy. 'Oh, my' cried Uncle Wiggily, wrinkling up his nose. 'At first I thought you were a savage owl.' 'Oh, no, I'm not an owl,' said Dickie. 'But I'm in a great hurry, and perhaps I made a noise like an owl. Percival, you must come back home to the Bow Wow house right away.' 'Why?' asked Percival, sticking up his two ears so that he could hear better. 'Because Peetie Bow Wow is very ill with the German measles, and he wants to see you do some of your funny circus tricks,' spoke Dickie. 'He thinks that will make him better.' 'Ha! I've no doubt that it will!' exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. 'If I were not traveling about, seeking my fortune, I'd go back with you, Percival. I love Peetie Bow Wow, and Jackie, too.' 'Oh, I'll go,' said the grasshopper. 'I will play Peetie a funny fiddle tune, on my left hind leg, and that may make him laugh.' 'And Nellie and I will sail through the air, and go off to find some pretty flowers for him,' said Dickie. So the sparrow boy, the grasshopper and old Percival, the circus dog, started off together to see poor sick Peetie Bow Wow, leaving Uncle Wiggily there on the grass. 'Give my love to Peetie!' called the old gentleman rabbit after them, 'and tell him that I'll come and see him as soon as I find my fortune.' Uncle Wiggily felt a little bit sad and lonely when his friends were gone, but he ate another piece of cherry pie, taking care to get none of the juice, on his blue necktie, and then he was a little happier. 'Now to start off once more,' he said. 'I wonder what will happen next? But I know one thing, I'm never going to do any jumping for any squatty old toads any more.' So Uncle Wiggily traveled on and on, and when it came night he didn't have any place to sleep. But as it happened he met a kind old water snake, who had a nice house in an old pile of wood, and there the rabbit stayed until morning, when the water snake got him a nice breakfast of pond lilies, with crinkly eel-grass sauce on. Pretty soon it was nearly noon that day, and Uncle Wiggily was about to sit down on a nice green mossy bank in the woods, not a toy bank with money in it, you understand, but a dirt-bank, with moss on it like a carpet. That's where he was going to sit. 'I think I'll eat my dinner,' said the old gentleman rabbit as he opened his valise, and just then he heard a voice in the woods singing. And this was the song:     'Oh dear! I'm lost, I know I am,       I don't know what to do.     I had a big red ribbon, and       I had one colored blue.     But now I haven't got a one       Because a savage bear     Took both of them, and tied a string       Around my curly hair.     I wish I had a penny bright,       To buy a trolley car.     I'd ride home then, because, you see,       To walk it is too far.' 'I guess that's some one in trouble, all right,' said Uncle Wiggily, as he cautiously peeped through the bushes. 'Though, perhaps, it is a little wolf boy, or a fox.' But when he looked, whom should he see but little Jennie Chipmunk, and she was crying as hard as she could cry, so she couldn't sing any more. 'Why, Jennie, what is the matter?' kindly asked Uncle Wiggily. 'Oh, I came out in the woods to gather acorns in a little basket for supper,' she said, 'and I guess I must have come too far. The first thing I knew a big bear jumped out of the bushes at me, and he took off both my nice, new hair ribbons and put on this old string.' And, sure enough, there was only just an old black shoestring on Jennie's nice hair. 'Where is that bear?' asked Uncle Wiggily, quite savage like. 'Just tell me where he is, and I'll make him give you back those ribbons, and then I'll show you the way home.' 'Oh, the bear ran off after he scared me,' said the little chipmunk girl. 'Please don't look for him, Uncle Wiggily, or he might eat you all up.' 'Pooh!' exclaimed the old gentleman rabbit. 'I'm not afraid of a bear. I have traveled around a great deal of late, and I have had many adventures. It takes more than a bear to scare me!' 'Oh, it does; does it?' suddenly cried a growly-scowly voice, and, would you believe me? right out from the bushes jumped that savage bear! And he had Jennie's blue ribbon tied on his left ear, and the red one tied on his right ear, and he looked too queer for anything. 'I can't scare you; eh?' he cried to the rabbit. 'Well, I'm just going to eat you, and that chipmunk girl all up, and maybe that will scare you!' So he made a jump for Uncle Wiggily, but do you s'pose the rabbit gentleman was afraid? Not a bit of it. He knew what he was going to do. 'Quick, Jennie!' called Uncle Wiggily. 'Get in front of me. I'll fix this bear all right.' So Jennie got in front, and the rabbit turned his back on the bear, and, then Uncle Wiggily began scratching in the dirt with his sharp claws. My! how he did make the dirt fly. It was just like a regular rain-shower of sand and gravel. And the dirt flew all over that bear; in his eyes and nose and mouth and ears, it went, and he sneezed, and he couldn't see out of his eyes, and he fairly howled. And by that time Uncle Wiggily had dug a big hole in the ground with his feet, and he and Jennie hid there until the bear ran off to get some water to wash the dirt off his face, and then the rabbit and the chipmunk girl came out safely. Then Uncle Wiggily gave Jennie some pennies to buy two new hair ribbons, and he showed her the way home with her basket of acorns, and he himself went on with his travels. And he had another adventure the next day. Now in case a cowboy doesn't come along, and take my little pussy cat off to the wild west show I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the paper lantern. STORY XIX UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE LANTERN After Uncle Wiggily had taken Jennie Chipmunk home, so that the bear couldn't get her, as I told you about in the story before this one, the old gentleman rabbit walked on over the fields and through the woods, seeking his fortune. He looked everywhere for it; down in hollow stumps, behind big stones, and even in an old well, but you may be sure he didn't jump down any more wells. No, I guess not! 'Ha! Here is a little brook!' exclaimed Uncle Wiggily, after a while, as he came to a small stream of water flowing over green, mossy stones, with a nice gurgling sound like an ice cream soda, 'perhaps I may find my fortune here.' But he looked and he looked in the water without seeing anything but a goldfish. 'I might sell the goldfish for money,' thought the fortune-hunting rabbit, 'but it wouldn't be kind to take him out of the brook, so I won't. I'll look a little farther, on the other side.' Then, taking up his crutch and his valise, Uncle Wiggily gave a big jump, and leaped safely across the water. Then, once more, he traveled on. Pretty soon he came to a place where there was a tree, and on one branch of this tree there hung a funny round ball, that looked as if it was made of gray-colored paper. And there was a funny buzzing sound coming from it. 'Ha! Do you see that?' asked a big, fat hop-toad, as he suddenly bobbed up out of the grass. It was the same toad who had made the rabbit jump down in the leaf-covered well. 'Do you see that?' asked the toad. 'Well, if you want to find your fortune, take a stick and hit that ball.' 'Indeed I will not!' cried the old gentleman rabbit. 'I know you and your tricks! That is a hornets' nest, and if I struck it they would fly out, and sting me. Oh, no! You can't catch me again. Now you go away, or I'll tell a policeman dog to arrest you.' So the toad knew it was of no use to try to fool Uncle Wiggily again, and he hopped away, scratching his warty back on a sharp stone. Well, the old gentleman rabbit traveled on and on, and when it came night he wondered where he was going to stay, for he hadn't yet found his fortune and the weather looked as if it was going to rain. Then, all of a sudden, he heard voices calling like this: 'Come on, Nannie, you've got to blind your eyes now, and I'll go hide.' 'All right, Billie,' was the answer. 'And after that we'll get Uncle Butter to tell us a story.' 'I guess I know who those children are,' thought Uncle Wiggily, though he had not yet seen them. 'That's Billie and Nannie Goat talking,' and surely enough it was, and, most unexpectedly the rabbit had come right up to the house where they lived, on the edge of the woods. Well, you can just imagine how glad Billie and Nannie were to see Uncle Wiggily. They danced all around him, and held him by the paws, and kissed him between his long ears, and Billie carried his satchel for him. 'Oh, we're so glad you are here!' they cried. 'Mamma! Papa! Uncle Butter! Here is Uncle Wiggily!' Well, the whole goat family was glad to see the rabbit-traveler, and after supper he told them of his adventures, and how he was out seeking his fortune. And Billie and Nannie told what they had been doing, and Nannie showed how she could cut things out of paper, like the children do in the kindergarten class in school. She could make little houses, with smoke coming out of the chimney, and paper lanterns, and boxes, and, oh! ever so many things. The lanterns she made were especially fine, just like Chinese ones. Then it came time to go to bed, and in the night a very strange thing happened, and I'm going to tell you all about it. Along about 12 o'clock, when all was still and quiet, and when the little mice were beginning to think it was time for them to creep, creep out of their holes, and hunt for bread and cheese; about this time there sounded a queer noise down at the front door of the goat-house. 'Ha! What is that?' asked Mrs. Goat. 'I guess it was the cats,' said Mr. Goat, getting ready to go to sleep again. 'No, I'm sure it was a burglar-fox!' said the lady goat. 'Please get up and look.' Well, of course, Mr. Goat had to do so, after his wife asked him like that. So he poked his head out of the upstairs window, over the front door, and he called out: 'Who is down there?' 'I'm a burglar-fox!' was the answer. 'I'm coming to rob you.' 'Oh, my!' cried Mrs. Goat, when she heard that. 'Get a gun, and shoot him, Mr. Goat.' And at that Billie and Nannie began to cry, for they were afraid of burglars, and Uncle Butter got up, and began looking for a whistle, with which to call a policeman dog, but he couldn't find it. Then the burglar-fox started in breaking down the door, so that he could get in, and still Mr. Goat couldn't find his gun. 'Oh, we'll all be killed!' cried Mrs. Goat. 'Oh, if some one would only help us!' 'Ha! I will help you!' cried Uncle Wiggily jumping out of bed. 'I'll scare that fox so that he'll run away.' 'But I can't find my gun,' said Mr. Goat. 'No matter,' answered the brave rabbit. 'I can scare him with a paper lantern such as Nannie can make. Quick, Nannie, make me a big paper lantern.' Well, the little goat girl stopped crying then, and she got her paper, and her scissors, and the paste pot, and she began to make a paper lantern, as big as a water pail. Uncle Wiggily and Billie helped her. And all the while the burglar-fox was banging on the door, and crying out: 'Let me in! Let me in!' 'Quick! is the lantern ready?' Asked Uncle Wiggily, jumping around in a circle like 'Ring Around the Rosie.' 'Here it is,' said Nannie. So the rabbit gentleman took it, all nicely made as it was, and inside of it he put a hot, blazing candle. And the lantern was so big that the candle didn't burn the sides of the paper. Then Uncle Wiggily tied the lantern to a string, and he lowered it right down out of the window; down in front of the burglar-fox, and the hot candle in the lantern burned the fox's nose, and he thought it was a policeman climbing down out of a tree to catch him, and before you could count forty-'leven the bad burglar-fox ran away, and so he didn't rob the goats after all. And, oh! how thankful Nannie and Billie and their papa and mamma were to Uncle Wiggily. Now, in case the little boy next door doesn't take our clothes line, to make a swing for his puppy dog, I'll tell you about Uncle Wiggily and the paper house in the following story. STORY XX UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE PAPER HOUSE Bright and early next morning Uncle Wiggily got up, and he took a careful look around to see if there were any signs of the burglar-fox, about whom I told you in another story. 'I guess he's far enough off by this time,' said Billie Goat, as he polished his horns with a green leaf. 'Yes, indeed,' spoke Uncle Wiggily. 'It is a good thing that Nannie knew how to make a paper lantern.' 'Oh, I can make lots of things out of paper,' said the little goat girl. 'Our teacher in school shows us how. Why I can even make a paper house.' 'Can you, indeed?' asked the old gentleman rabbit, as he washed his paws and face for breakfast. 'Now I should dearly like to know how to make a paper house.' 'Why?' asked Billie Goat, curious like. 'So that when I am traveling about, looking for my fortune, and night comes on, and I have no place to stay, then I could make me a paper house, and be all nice and dry in case it rained,' replied the rabbit. 'Oh, but the water would soon soak through the paper,' said Billie. 'I know, for once I made a paper boat, and sailed it on the pond, and soon it was soaked through, and sank away down.' 'Oh, but if I use that funny, greasy paper which comes inside cracker boxes, the kind with wax on it, that wouldn't wet through,' spoke the rabbit as he went inside the goat-house with the children, for Mrs. Goat had called them in to breakfast. 'That would be just fine!' exclaimed Nannie, as she passed some apple sauce and oatmeal to Uncle Wiggily. 'After breakfast I'll show you how to make a paper house.' Well, surely enough, as soon as breakfast was over, and before she and Billie had gone to school, Nannie showed the old gentleman rabbit how to make a paper house. You take some paper and some scissors, and you cut out the sides of the house and the roof, and you make windows and doors in these sides, and then you make a chimney, and you fasten them all together, with paste or glue, and, there you are. Isn't it easy? And if you only make the paper house large enough, you can get inside of it and have a play party, and perhaps you can make paper dishes and knives and forks; but listen! If you make paper things to eat, like cake or cookies or anything like that, please only make-believe to eat them, for they are bad for the digestion if you  really  chew them. 'Well, I think I'll travel along now, and once more seek my fortune,' said Uncle Wiggily, when Billie and Nannie were ready to go to school. So Mrs. Goat packed up for the rabbit a nice lunch in his valise, and Nannie gave him some waxed paper, that the rain wouldn't melt, and Billie gave his uncle a pair of scissors, and off Mr. Longears started. Well, he traveled on and on, over the fields and through the woods, and across little brooks, and pretty soon it was coming on dark night, and the rabbit gentleman hadn't found his fortune. 'Now I wonder where I can stay to-night?' thought Uncle Wiggily, as he looked about him. He could see nothing but an old stump, which was not hollow, so he couldn't get inside of it, and the only other thing that happened to be there was a flat stone, and he couldn't get under that. 'I guess I must make me a paper house,' said the old gentleman rabbit. 'Then I can sleep in it in peace and quietness, and I'll travel on again in the morning.' So he got out the waxed paper, and he took the scissors, and, sitting down on the green grass, he cut out the sides and roof of the paper house. Then he made the chimney, and put it on the roof, and then he fastened the house together, and crawled inside, with his valise and his barber-pole crutch. 'I guess I won't make too many windows or doors,' thought Uncle Wiggily, 'for a savage bear or a burglar-fox might come along in the night, and try to get in.' So he only made one door, and one window in the house. But he made a little fireplace out of stones, and built a little fire in it, to cook his supper. But listen, you children must never, never make a fire, unless some big person is near to put it out in case it happens to run away, and chases after you, to catch you. Fires are dreadfully scary things for little folks, so please be careful. Well, Uncle Wiggily cooked his supper, frying some carrots in a little tin frying pan he had with him, and then he said his prayers, and went to bed. Soon he was fast, fast asleep. Well, in the middle of the night, Uncle Wiggily was awakened in his paper house by hearing a funny noise outside. 'Ha! I wonder what that can be?' he exclaimed, sitting up, and reaching out for his crutch. The noise kept on, 'pitter-patter; pitter-patter-patter-pitter; pat-pit-pat-pit.' 'Oh, that sounds like the toe nails of the burglar-fox, running around the house!' said the rabbit. Then he listened more carefully, and suddenly he laughed: 'Ha! Ha!' Then he got up and looked out of the window. 'Why, it's only the rain drops pit-pattering on the roof,' he said. 'Isn't it jolly to be in a house when it rains, and you can't get wet? After this every night I'm going to always build a waxed-paper house,' said Uncle Wiggily. So he listened to the rain drops, and he thought how nice it was not to be wet, and he went to sleep again. And pretty soon he woke up once more, for he heard another noise. This time it was a sniffing, snooping, woofing sort of a noise, and Uncle Wiggily knew that it wasn't the rain. 'I'm sure that's the burglar-fox,' he said. 'What shall I do? He can smash my paper house with his teeth and claws, and then eat me. I should have built a wooden house. But it's too late now. I know what I'll do. I'll dig a cellar underneath my paper house, and I'll hide there, in case that fox smashes the roof.' So Uncle Wiggily got up very softly, and right in the middle of the dirt floor of his paper house he began to burrow down to dig a cellar. My, how his paws made the sand and gravel fly, and soon he had dug quite a large cellar, in which to hide. And all this time the sniffing, snooping sound kept on, until, all of a sudden a voice cried: 'Let me in!' 'Who are you?' asked Uncle Wiggily. 'I'm the bad alligator,' was the answer, 'and if you don't let me in, I'll smash down your paper house with one swoop of my scalery-ailery tail.' 'You can't come in!' cried the rabbit, and then that bad alligator gave one swoop of his tail, and smashed Uncle Wiggily's nice paper house all to pieces! But do you s'pose the rabbit was there? No, indeed. He just grabbed up his crutch and valise, and ran down into his cellar as far and as fast as he could run, just as the roof fell in. And the cellar wasn't big enough for the alligator to get in, and so he had to stay outside, and he couldn't get Uncle Wiggily. And then it rained, and thundered and lightninged, and the alligator got scared, and ran off, but the rabbit gentleman was safe down in his cellar, and he didn't get a bit wet, and went to sleep there for the rest of the night. Now, please go to bed, and in case my toothbrush, doesn't go out roller skating, and fall down and get bald-headed, I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the paper boat. STORY XXI UNCLE WIGGILY IN A PAPER BOAT When the morning dawned, after he had slept all night in the cellar under his paper house, that the alligator, with his swooping scalery-ailery tail, had knocked down, Uncle Wiggily awakened, brushed the dirt from his ears, and crawled out. 'My!' he exclaimed as he saw the paper house all flat on the ground, like a pancake, 'Nannie Goat would certainly be sorry to see this. But I suppose it can't be helped. Anyhow, it's a good thing that I am not squashed as flat as that house is. Now I'll see about my breakfast, and then I'll travel on again.' So the old gentleman rabbit got his breakfast, eating almost the last piece of the cherry pie, which he had left from the time when he made some for the hedgehog, and then, taking his crutch, striped red, white and blue, like a barber pole, off he started. Well, pretty soon, in a little while, not so very long, Uncle Wiggily came to a pond of water, and, looking down into it, he saw the most beautiful goldfish that you can imagine. It was a big fish, too, and the scales on it were as round as gold dollars. 'My!' exclaimed the rabbit. 'If I had that fish, and I could take him to a jewelry shop, and sell him, I would get so much money that my fortune would be made, and I wouldn't have to travel any farther. But I guess the fish would rather stay in the pond than in a jewelry shop.' 'Indeed, I would,' answered the fish, looking up. 'And I am glad you are so kind as to be thoughtful of my feelings. Perhaps I may be able to help you, some day.' And with that the fish dived away down under the water, after calling good-bye to the rabbit, and then Uncle Wiggily hopped on, and he didn't think any more about the goldfish, until some time after that. Well, as soon as the elephant had his trunk packed, Oh, hold on, if you please. I wonder what's the matter with me? There's no elephant in this story. He comes in it about five pages farther on. Well, after traveling for several hours, Uncle Wiggily ate his dinner, then he hopped on some more, and he looked all around for his fortune, but he couldn't find it. Then it began to get dark, and he wondered where he could stay that night. 'I might build a paper house,' he said, 'but if I do the alligator might come along and smash it, and this time he would probably catch me. I wonder what I'd better do?' So he looked ahead, and there he saw a stream of water. It was quite a wide brook, but on the other side of it he saw a nice little wooden house, that no one lived in. 'Now, if I could only get over there I'd be safe,' said the old gentleman rabbit. 'I guess I'll wade across.' Well, he started to do so, but he soon found that the water was too deep for him to wade. It was over his head. 'I'll have to swim across,' said Uncle Wiggily. But, as soon as he got ready to do that, he found himself in more trouble. For he couldn't carry his crutch and valise across with him if he swam, and he didn't like to leave them on the shore, for fear the alligator would get them. 'Oh, I certainly am in great trouble,' said the rabbit. 'It's getting darker and darker, and I have no place to stay. I haven't even any paper with which to make me a paper house, but if I could only get across to the wooden house, I'd be safe.' And, just as he spoke, there came a little puff of wind, and lo and behold! a nice piece of paper was blown right down out of a tree, where it had been caught on a branch. Right at Uncle Wiggily's side it fell; that paper did. 'Oh, joy!' the rabbit gentleman cried. 'Here is paper to make me a house with.' But when he looked more closely at it, he saw that it wasn't big enough for a house, and it wasn't the kind of paper that would keep out the rain, either. 'That will never do,' said Uncle Wiggily, sadly. 'Ah! But I have an idea. I will make me a paper boat, as Billie Goat once did, and in the boat I'll sail across the stream, and sleep in the little wooden house.' So he folded up the paper, first like a soldier's hat, and then like a fireman's hat, and then he pulled on the two ends, and, presto change! he had a paper boat. Then he took his crutch, and stuck it up in the middle of the boat, and put a piece of paper on the crutch, and he had a sail. Then he put the boat in the water, and got in it himself. I mean he got in the boat, not the water, with his valise. 'Here we go!' cried the old gentleman rabbit, and he shoved the boat out from the shore. The wind caught in the little paper sail, and away Uncle Wiggily went, as fine as fine could be. 'I'll soon be on the other shore,' he said, and just then he looked down, and he saw some water coming inside the boat. 'Hum! That's bad,' he cried. 'I'm afraid my boat is leaking.' The wind blew harder, and the boat went faster, but more water came in, for you see the paper was sort of melting, and falling apart, like an ice cream cone, for it wasn't the waxed kind of paper from the inside of cracker boxes, the kind that water won't hurt. Well, the boat began to sink, and the water came up to Uncle Wiggily's knees, and then, all of a sudden there was a funny sound on shore, a snipping snooping woofing-woofing sound, and into the water jumped the alligator with the skiller-scalery, swooping tail. 'Now I've got you!' he cried, snapping his jaws at the poor old gentleman rabbit. And really it did seem as if Uncle Wiggily would be eaten up. But you never can tell what is going to happen in this world; never indeed. All of a sudden, just as the paper boat was melting all to pieces, and Uncle Wiggily was trying, as best he could, to swim to shore with his crutch and valise, and just as the alligator was going to grab him, along came the big, kind goldfish. 'Jump on my back, Uncle Wiggily!' cried the fish, and the rabbit did so, in the twinkling of an eye. And before the alligator could grab Uncle Wiggily, the goldfish swam to shore with him, and he was safe. And the alligator got some soap in his eye, from washing his face too hard, and went sloshing away as mad as could be, but it served him right. And Uncle Wiggily slept safely in the wooden house all night, and dreamed about finding a gold dollar. Now in case the banana man brings me some pink oranges for the elephant's little boy, I'll tell you in another story about Uncle Wiggily and the mud pie.[Transcriber's Note: in the above sentence, the word 'tell' was omitted in the original text.] STORY XXII UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE MUD PIE Uncle Wiggily slept very soundly that night in the little wooden house, across on the other side of the brook, where the alligator tried to catch him, but didn't. And when he awakened in the morning the rabbit traveler wondered what he was going to have for breakfast. But he didn't wonder very long. For, as soon as he had gotten up, and had washed his paws and face, and combed out his ears, oh, dear me, I mean his whiskers, as soon as he had done that, he heard a knock on the door. 'Oh, my, suz dud and a bottle of milk!' exclaimed the old gentleman rabbit. 'I hope that isn't the scary-flary alligator again.' So he peeped out of the window, but to his surprise, he didn't see any one. 'I'm sure I heard a knock,' he said, 'but I guess I was mistaken.' Well, he was going over to his valise to see if it had in it anything to eat, when the knock again sounded on the door. 'No, I wasn't mistaken,' said Uncle Wiggily. 'I wonder who that can be? I'll peep, and find out.' So he hid behind the window curtain, and kept a close watch, and the first things he saw were some little stones flying through the air. And they hit against the front door with a rattlety-bang, and it was these stones that had made the sound that was like a knock. 'Oh! it must be some bad boys after me,' thought the poor old gentleman rabbit. 'My! I do seem to be having a dreadful time seeking my fortune. There is always some kind of trouble.' And then more stones came through the air, and banged on the door and this time Uncle Wiggily saw that they came from the stream, and, what is more, he saw the goldfish throwing the stones and pebbles out of the brook with his tail. Then the rabbit knew it was all right, for the goldfish was a friend of his, so he ran out. 'Were you throwing stones at the house?' asked Uncle Wiggily. 'Yes,' replied the fish, 'it was the only way in which I could knock on your door. You see I dare not leave the water, and I wanted you to know that I had some breakfast for you.' And with that the kind goldfish took a little basket, made of watercress, from off his left front fin, and handed Uncle Wiggily the basket, not his fin, for he needed that to swim with. 'You'll find some cabbage-salad with snorkery-snickery ell-grass dressing on it, some water-lily cake, and some moss covered eggs for your breakfast,' said the fish. 'And I wish you good luck on your travels to-day.' 'Thank you very much,' said Uncle Wiggily, 'and I am very much obliged to you for saving me from the alligator last night.' 'Pray do not mention it,' spoke the fish most condescendingly. 'I always like to help my friends.' And with that he swam away, and Uncle Wiggily ate his breakfast, and then, taking his crutch and valise, he set off on his travels again. He hopped on for some time, and finally he came to a place where there were some high, prickly bramble-briar bushes. 'I will rest here in their shade a bit,' thought the old gentleman rabbit, 'and then I will go on.' So he sat down, and, as the sun was quite warm, he fell asleep before he knew it. But he was suddenly awakened by a hissing sound, just like when steam comes out of the parlor radiator on a frosty night. Then a voice cried: 'Now I've got you!' Uncle Wiggily looked up, and there was a big snake, just going to grab him. But do you s'pose the rabbit waited for that snake? Not a bit of it. Catching up his crutch and valise, he gave one tremendous and extraordinary springery-spring, and over the prickery stickery briar and bramble bushes he went, flying through the air, and the snake couldn't get him. But when Uncle Wiggily came down on the other side of the bushes! Oh, my! that was a different story. For where do you imagine he landed? Where, indeed, but right in the middle of a big mud pie that two little hedgehog boys were making there. Yes, sir, right into the middle of that squasher-squawshery mud pie fell Uncle Wiggily. Oh! How the mud splashed up! It went all over the rabbit, and some got on the two little hedgehog boys. Well, they were as surprised as anything when they saw a nice old gentleman rabbit come down in the middle of their pie, and at first they thought he had done it on purpose. 'Let's stick him full of our stickery-stockery quills,' said one hedgehog boy. 'Yes, and then let's pull his ears,' said the other hedgehog boy. But, mind you, they didn't really mean anything bad, only, perhaps, they thought Uncle Wiggily was a savage fox, or a little white bear. 'Oh, boys, I'm sorry!' said the old gentleman rabbit as soon as he could dig the mud out of his mouth. 'What made you do it?' asked the biggest hedgehog boy, wiping some mud out of his eye. 'Yes, our pie is all spoiled,' said his brother, 'and we were just going to bake it.' 'Oh, it is too bad!' said Uncle Wiggily, sorrowfully, 'but you see I had to get away from that snake, and I didn't have time to look where I was jumping. I'm glad, though, that I left the snake on the other side of the bushes.' 'So are we,' said the two hedgehog boys. 'But you didn't leave me there. I'm here!' suddenly cried a voice, and out wiggled the snake again. He started to catch the rabbit, but those two brave hedgehog boys grabbed up a lot of mud, and plastered it in that snake's eyes so that he couldn't see, and he had to wiggle down to the pond to wash it out. Then Uncle Wiggily and the boys were safe, and he helped them to make another mud pie, with stones in for raisins, and he gave them some of his real cherry pie, and oh! how they liked it! Then they were all happy, and Uncle Wiggily stayed at the hedgehog's house until the next morning. Now, in case the little girl in the next house brings me a watermelon ice cream cone with a rose on top, I'll tell you on the next page about Uncle Wiggily and the elephant. STORY XXIII UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE ELEPHANT Uncle Wiggily didn't sleep very well at the hedgehog's house that night, and the reason for it was this: You see they didn't have many beds there, and first the rabbit gentleman lay down with the smallest little porcupine boy, in his bed. But pretty soon, along about in the middle of the night, this little boy got to dreaming that he was a rubber ball. And he rolled over in the bed, and he rolled up against Uncle Wiggily, and the stickery-stickers from the little hedgehog chap stuck in the old gentleman rabbit. 'Oh, dear!' cried Uncle Wiggily, 'I think I'll have to go and sleep with your brother Jimmie.' So he went over to the other hedgehog boy's bed, but land sakes flopsy-dub and a basket of soap bubbles! As soon as the rabbit got in there that other hedgehog chap began to dream that he was a jumping jack, and so he jumped up and down, and he jumped on top of Uncle Wiggily, and stuck more stickery-stickers in him, until at last the rabbit got up and said: 'Oh, dear, I guess I'll have to go to sleep on the floor.' So he did that, putting his head on his satchel for a pillow and pulling his red-white-and-blue-striped-barber-pole crutch over him for a cover. And, in the morning, he felt a little better. 'Well, I think I will travel on once more,' said Uncle Wiggily after a breakfast of strawberries, and mush and milk. 'I may find my fortune to-day.' The hedgehog boys wanted him to stay with them, and make more mud pies, or even a cherry one, but the rabbit gentleman said he had no time. So off he went over hills and down dales, and along through the woods. Pretty soon, not so very long, just as Uncle Wiggily was walking behind a big rock, as large as a house, he heard some one crying. Oh, such a loud crying voice as it was, and the old rabbit gentleman was a bit frightened. 'For it sounds like a giant crying,' he said to himself. 'And if it's a giant he may be a bad one, who would hurt me. I guess I'll run back the other way.' Well, he started to run, but, just as he did so, he heard the voice crying again, and this time it said: 'Oh, dear me! Oh, if some one would only help me! Oh, I am in such trouble!' 'Come, I don't believe that is a giant after all,' thought the rabbit. 'It may be Sammie Littletail, who has grown to be such a big boy that I won't know him any more.' So he took a careful look, but instead of seeing his little rabbit nephew, he saw a big elephant, sitting on the ground, crying as hard as he could cry. Now, you know, when an elephant cries it isn't like when you cry once in a great while, or when baby cries every day. No, indeed! An elephant cries so very many tears that if you don't have a water pail near you, to catch them, you may get your feet wet; that is, if you don't have on rubbers. Well, that's the way it was this time. The elephant was crying big, salty tears, about the size of rubber balls, and they were rolling down from his eyes and along his trunk, which was like a fire engine hose, until there was quite a little stream of water flowing down the hill toward the rabbit. 'Oh, please don't cry any more!' called Uncle Wiggily. 'Why not?' asked the elephant, sadly-like, and he cried harder than before. 'Because if you do,' replied the rabbit, 'I will have to get a pair of rubber boots, in which to wade out to see you.' 'I'll try to stop,' said the big animal, but, instead, he cried harder than before, boo-hooing and hoo-booing, until you would have thought it was raining, and Uncle Wiggily wished he had an umbrella. 'Why, whatever is the matter?' asked the rabbit. 'Oh, I stepped on a tack,' answered the elephant, 'and it is sticking in my foot. I can't walk, and I can't dance and I can't get back to the circus. Oh, dear! Oh, dear me, suz-dud and a red balloon! Oh, how miserable I am!' 'Too bad,' said Uncle Wiggily. 'Was it a large tack that you stepped on?' 'Was it?' asked the elephant, sort of painful-like. 'Why, it feels as big as a dishpan in my foot. Here, you look, and perhaps you can pull it out.' He raised up one of his big feet, which were about as large as a washtub full of clothes, on Monday morning, and he held it out to Uncle Wiggily. 'Why, I can't see anything here,' said the rabbit, looking at the big foot through his spectacles. 'Oh, dear! It's there all right!' cried the elephant. 'It feels like two wash tubs now,' and he began to cry some more. 'Here! Hold on, if you please!' shouted Uncle Wiggily. 'I'll have to make a boat, if you keep on shedding so many tears, for there will be a lake here. Wait, I'll look once more.' So he looked again, and this time he saw just the little, tiniest, baby-tack you can imagine, about the size of a pinhead, sticking in the elephant's foot. 'Wait! I have it! Was this it?' suddenly asked the rabbit, as he took hold of the tack in his paw and pulled it out. 'That's it!' exclaimed the elephant, waving his trunk. 'It's out! Oh, how much better I feel. Whoop-de-doodle-do!' and then he felt so fine that he began to dance. Then, all of a sudden, he began to cry once more. 'Why, what in the world is the matter now?' asked Uncle Wiggily, wishing he had a pail, so that he might catch the elephant's salty tears. 'Oh, I feel so happy that I can't help crying, because my pain is gone!' exclaimed the big creature. Then he cried about forty-'leven bushels of tears, and a milk bottle full besides, and there was a little pond around him, and Uncle Wiggily was in it up to his neck. Then, all of a sudden, in came swimming the alligator, right toward the rabbit. 'Ah, now I'll get you!' cried the skillery-scalery beast. 'No you won't!' shouted the elephant, 'Uncle Wiggily is my friend!' So he put his trunk down in the water, and sucked it all up, and then he squirted it over the trees. That left the alligator on dry land, and then the elephant grabbed the alligator up in his strong trunk, and tossed him into the briar bushes, scalery-ailery tail and all, and the alligator crawled away after a while. So that's how Uncle Wiggily was saved from the alligator by the crying elephant, and the rabbit and elephant traveled on together for some days. Now, as I see the sand man coming, I must stop. But, in case I don't fall into the washtub with my new suit on, and get it all colored sky-blue-pink, so I can't go to the picnic, I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the cherry tree. STORY XXIV UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE CHERRY TREE Uncle Wiggily Longears and the crying elephant were walking along together one day, talking about the weather, and wondering if it would rain, and all things like that. Only the elephant wasn't crying any more, for the rabbit had pulled the tack that was hurting him, out of the big beast's foot, you remember. 'We'll travel on together to find our fortune, and look for adventures,' said the elephant, as he capered about, and stood on his hind legs, because he felt so jolly. 'Won't we have fun, Uncle Wiggily?' 'Well, we may,' spoke the old gentleman rabbit, 'but I don't see how we are going to carry along on our travels enough for us to eat. Of course,  I  don't need much, but  you  are such a big chap that you will have to have quite a lot, and my valise is small.' 'Don't worry about that,' replied the elephant. 'Of course you might think I could carry a lot of pie and cake and bread and butter in my trunk, but really I can't you know, for about all that my trunk will hold is water. However, I think I can pick what hay and grass I want from along the road.' 'Yes, and perhaps we may meet a man with a hot peanut wagon, once in a while,' suggested Uncle Wiggily, 'and he may give you some peanuts.' 'Oh, joy! I hope he does!' cried the big fellow. 'I just love hot peanuts!' Well, they went on together for some time, when, all of a sudden a man jumped out from behind the bushes, and exclaimed: 'Ha, Mr. Elephant! I've been looking for you. Now you come right back with me to the circus where you belong.' And he went up to the elephant and took hold of his trunk. 'Oh, I don't want to go,' whined the tremendous creature. 'I want to stay with Uncle Wiggily, and have some fun.' 'But you can't,' said the man. 'You are needed in the circus. A lot of boys and girls are waiting in the tent, to give you peanuts and popcorn.' 'Well, then, I s'pose I'd better go back,' sighed the wobbly animal with the long tusks. 'I'll see you again, Uncle Wiggily.' So the elephant said good-bye to the rabbit, and went back to the circus with the man, while the rabbit gentleman hopped on by himself. He hadn't gone very far before he heard a loud 'Honk-honk!' in the bushes. 'Oh, there is another one of those terrible automobiles!' thought the rabbit. But it wasn't at all. No, it was Grandfather Goosey Gander, and there he sat on a flat stone, 'honk-honking' through his yellow bill as hard as he could, and, at the same time crying salty tears that ran down his nose, making it all wet. 'Why, whatever is the matter?' asked Uncle Wiggily, as he went up to his friend, the duck-drake gentleman. 'Have you stepped on a tack, too?' 'No, it isn't that,' was the answer. 'But I am so sick that I don't know what to do, and I'm far from my home, and from my friends, the Wibblewobble family, and, oh, dear! it's just awful.' 'Let me look at your tongue,' said the rabbit, and when Grandfather Goosey Gander stuck it out, Uncle Wiggily said: 'Why, you have the epizootic very bad. Very bad, indeed! But perhaps I can cure you. Let me see, I think you need some bread and butter, and a cup of catnip tea. I'll make you some.' So Uncle Wiggily made a little fire of sticks, and then he found an empty tin tomato can, and he boiled some water in it over the fire, and made the catnip tea. Then he gave some to Grandfather Goosey Gander, together with some bread and butter. 'Well, I feel a little better,' said the old gentleman duck-drake, when he had eaten, 'but I am not well yet. It seems to me that if I could have some cherry pie I would feel better.' 'Perhaps you would,' agreed Uncle Wiggily, 'but, though I know how to make nice cherry pie, and though I made some for the hedgehog, I don't see any cherry trees around here, so I can't make you one. There are no cherry trees.' 'Yes, there is one over there,' said the duck-drake, and he waved one foot toward it, while he quacked real faint and sorrowful-like. 'Sure enough, that  is  a cherry tree,' said Uncle Wiggily, as he hopped over and looked at it. 'And the cherries are ripe, too. Now, if I could only get some of them down I could make a cherry pie, and cure Grandfather Goosey Gander.' But it wasn't easy to get the cherries off the tree, and Uncle Wiggily couldn't climb up after them. So he sat down and looked up at them, hoping some would fall off the stems. But none did. 'Oh, dear, I wonder how I'm going to get them?' sighed the rabbit. 'Perhaps I can knock off some with a stone.' So he threw a stone, but no cherries came down. The stone did, though, and hit Uncle Wiggily on the nose, making him sneeze. 'Stones are no good!' exclaimed the rabbit. 'I'll throw up my crutch.' So he threw that into the tree, but it brought no cherries down, and the crutch, in falling, nearly hit Grandfather Goosey Gander, and almost gave him the measles and mumps. 'Well, I'll try and see what throwing up my valise will do,' said the rabbit, and he tossed up the satchel, but bless you, that stayed up in the tree, and didn't come down at all, neither did any cherries. 'Oh, I'll have to give up,' said Uncle Wiggily. 'I'm afraid you can't have any cherry pie, Grandfather Goosey.' 'Oh, then I'll never get well,' said the old duck-drake gentleman sorrowfully. 'Yes, you will, too!' suddenly cried out a voice, and out from the bushes ran the elephant. 'I'll pick the cherries off the tree with my long, nosey trunk,' he said, 'and you can make all the pie you want to, Uncle Wiggily.' 'Why, I thought you went back to the circus,' said the rabbit. 'No, I ran away from the man,' spoke the elephant. Then he reached up with his long nose, and he picked a bushel of red, ripe, sweet delicious cherries in less than a minute. Then he pulled down Uncle Wiggily's valise out of the tree and then the old gentleman rabbit made three cherry pies. One for Grandfather Goosey Gander, and another, a tremendous big one, as large as a washtub, for the elephant, and a little one for himself. Then they ate their pies, and the old gentleman duck-drake got well almost at once. So all three of them traveled on together, to help the rabbit seek his fortune. Now in case the ice cream man brings some nice, hot roast chestnuts for our canary bird, I'll tell you in another story about Uncle Wiggily, and Grandfather Goosey Gander. STORY XXV UNCLE WIGGILY AND GRANDPA GOOSEY One day, not very long after the elephant had picked the cherries off the tree, so that Uncle Wiggily could make the cherry pies for Grandpa Goosey, the three friends were traveling along together through a deep, dark, dismal woods. 'Where are we going?' asked the elephant, who had run away from the circus man to travel by himself. 'Oh, to some place where we may find our fortune,' said the old gentleman rabbit. 'I would much rather find some snails to eat,' said Grandfather Goosey Gander, the old gentleman duck, as I shall call him for short. 'For I am very hungry.' 'What's that?' cried the rabbit. 'Hungry after the nice pie I made for you?' 'Oh, that was some time ago. I could eat another pie right now,' spoke the old duck. But there wasn't any pie for him, so he had to eat a cornmeal sandwich with watercress salad on, and Uncle Wiggily ate some carrots and cabbage, and the elephant ate a lot of grass from a field, oh! a terrible lot, about ten bushels, I guess. Then, all at once, as they were walking along over a bridge, a man suddenly jumped out from behind a tree, and cried: 'Ah, ha! Now you won't get away from me, Mr. Elephant. This time I am surely going to take you back to the circus.' And with that he threw a rope around the elephant's trunk, and led him away. The elephant cried so many tears that there was a muddy puddle right near the bridge, and the big animal begged to be allowed to stay with Uncle Wiggily and Grandpa Goosey Gander, but the man said it could not be done. 'Well, then, you and I will have to go on together,' said the old gentleman rabbit to the duck, after a bit. 'Perhaps we may find our fortune.' 'I think I could make money calling out 'honk-honk!' on an automobile,' said the grandfather. 'Jimmie Wibblewobble once did that for a man. I think I'll look for a nice automobile gentleman to work for, and if I get money enough we'll be rich.' Well, he looked and looked, but no one seemed to want an old duck for an auto horn, and the rabbit and Grandfather Goosey Gander kept on traveling together, over the fields and through the woods. Pretty soon they came to a place where a June bug was sitting on the edge of a stone wall, buzzing his wings. 'Let's ask him where we can find our fortunes,' said Uncle Wiggily. So they asked the June bug. 'Well,' replied the buzzing creature, 'I am not sure, but a little way from here are two roads. One or the other might bring you to your fortune. One goes to the right, the other to the left hand.' 'We will take the left hand road,' said Uncle Wiggily. 'We will go down that for some distance, and if we do not find a pot of gold, or some ice cream cones at the end of it, we will come back, and try the other road.' So Uncle Wiggily and Grandfather Goosey Gander went down the left road. On and on they went, walking in the dust when there was any dust, and in the mud when there was any mud. But they didn't find any gold. 'Oh, let's go back and try the other road,' said the rabbit gentleman after a bit. 'Perhaps that will be better.' So back they went, stopping on the way to look at a big apple tree, to see if there were any ripe apples on it. But there was none, so they didn't eat any. And I hope you children do the same this summer. Never eat green apples, never, never, never! Wait until they are ripe. Well, by and by, after a while, not so very long, Uncle Wiggily, who was hopping along on his crutch, suddenly exclaimed: 'Oh, I've lost my valise! What shall I do? I can't go on without it, for it has our lunch in it.' 'I think you left it under the green-apple tree,' said the duck. 'You had better go back for it, and I will wait here in the shade,' for Grandpa Goosey knew the rabbit could hop faster than he could waddle. Back Uncle Wiggily started, and, surely enough, he found his valise under the apple tree, where he had forgotten it. He picked it up, and was walking along with it back to where Grandfather Goosey Gander was waiting for him when, all of a sudden, out from behind a stump came Jennie Chipmunk, with a basket of popcorn balls. 'Oh, Uncle Wiggily!' she exclaimed. 'Don't you want to buy some popcorn balls? Our church is having a little fair, and we are all trying to earn some money. I am selling popcorn, to help the little heathen children buy red-colored handkerchiefs.' 'Of course, I'll take some,' said the old gentleman rabbit, 'popcorn balls, I mean, not children, or hankerchiefs,' he said quickly. So he bought a pink one, and a white one, and a chocolate colored one, popcorn balls you know, not children, and put them in his valise. Then Uncle Wiggily sent his love to Sammie and Susie Littletail, by Jennie Chipmunk, and off he started to go back to where Grandfather Goosey Gander was waiting for him. Well, something terrible was happening to the poor old gentleman duck, and I'll tell you all about it. No sooner had the rabbit gotten near the shady tree under which the grandfather gentleman was resting, than he heard a cry: 'Help! Help! Help!' called the duck. 'Oh, help me quickly, somebody!' 'What is the matter?' asked Uncle Wiggily, limping along as fast as he could. 'Oh, a bad snake has caught me!' cried the duck. 'He has wound himself around my legs, and I can't walk, and he is going to eat me up! He jumped on me out of the bushes. He will eat me!' 'He shall never do that!' cried the rabbit, bravely. 'I will save you.' So he ran up to that snake, but the snake stuck out his tongue, like a fork, at the rabbit, and Uncle Wiggily was frightened. Then he tried to hit the snake with a stick, but the crawly creature hid down behind Grandfather Goosey, and so got out of the way. 'I have it!' suddenly cried Uncle Wiggily. 'The popcorn balls. Snakes love them! I'll make him eat them, and then he'll let Grandpa Goosey go.' So from his valise the brave rabbit took the red and the white and the chocolate colored popcorn balls, and he rolled them along the ground, close to the snake's nose. And the snake smelled them, and he was so hungry for them that he uncoiled himself from Grandfather Goosey's legs, and let the old gentleman duck go. And the snake chased after the corn balls and ate them all up, and then he didn't want anything more for a long while, and he went to sleep for six months and dreamed about turning into a hoop, and so he didn't bother anybody. So that's how Uncle Wiggily saved the duck, and next, in case the pretty baby across the street doesn't fall down and bump its nose, I'll tell you about Uncle Wiggily and the ice cream cones. STORY XXVI UNCLE WIGGILY'S ICE CREAM CONES It didn't take Uncle Wiggily and Grandfather Goosey Gander long to get away from the place where the bad snake was, let me tell you, even if the crawly creature had eaten three popcorn balls, and would sleep for six months. 'This is no place for us,' said the rabbit. 'We must see if we can't find our fortune somewhere else.' 'I believe you,' spoke Grandfather Goosey, rubbing his yellow legs, where the snake had wound tight around him like a clothesline. 'We'll look for a place in which to stay to-night, and we'll see what we can find to-morrow.' Well, they hurried on for some time, and pretty soon it began to get dark, and they couldn't find any place to stay. 'I guess I'll have to dig a hole in the ground, and make a burrow,' said the rabbit. 'Oh, but I couldn't stay underground,' said the duck. 'I'm used to sleeping in a wooden house.' 'That's so,' said Uncle Wiggily. 'Well, if I had some paper I could make you a paper house, but I haven't any, so I don't know what to do.' And just then, away in the air, there sounded a voice saying: 'Caw! Caw! Caw!' 'Ha! That's a crow,' exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. 'There must be green corn that is ready to pull up somewhere around here.' 'There is,' said the black crow, flying down. 'I know a nice field of corn that a farmer has planted, and to-morrow I am going to pick some.' 'But aren't you afraid of the scarecrow?' asked the duck. 'No; I'm not,' said the crow. 'The scarecrow is only some old clothes stuffed with straw, and it is set out in the field to drive us crows away. We're not a bit afraid of it. Would you be?' 'No, of course not,' answered Grandfather Goosey Gander. 'But then, you see, I'm not a crow, the scary figure wasn't meant for me.' 'Then you can stay in one of the pockets of the scarecrow's coat all night,' said the crow. 'It will be a good place for you to sleep.' 'The very thing!' cried Uncle Wiggily. So that night he dug himself a little house under the ground, and the duck gentleman flew up, and got inside the pocket of the old coat which the scarecrow figure wore, and there the duck stayed all night, sleeping very soundly. 'Well, now we'll travel on again,' said Uncle Wiggily, the next morning after breakfast. So he and Grandfather Goosey started off. Well, pretty soon it became hotter and hotter, for the sun was just beaming down as hard as it could, and Uncle Wiggily exclaimed: 'I know what would taste good! An ice cream cone for each of us. Wait here, grandfather, and I'll get two of them.' 'Fine!' cried the grandfather duck. 'But you seem to do all the hopping around, Uncle Wiggily. Why can't I go, while you rest?' 'Oh, I don't in the least mind going,' replied the kind rabbit. 'Besides, while I do not say it to be proud, and far be it from me to boast, I can go a little faster than you can in one hop. So I'll go.' And go he did, leaving his valise in charge of Grandfather Goosey, who sat down with it, under a shady tree. Pretty soon the old gentleman rabbit came to a little ice cream store, that stood beside the road, right near a little pond of water, where the ice-cream-man could wash his dishes when he had to make them clean. 'I'll have two, nice, big, cold strawberry ice cream cones, and please put plenty of ice cream in them,' said Uncle Wiggily to the man. 'Right you are!' cried the ice-cream-man in a jolly voice, and, say, I just wish you could have seen those cones! They were piled up heaping full of ice cream. Oh, my! It just makes me hungry to write about them. Well, Uncle Wiggily, carefully carrying the cones, started to hop back to where he had left Grandfather Goosey. He hadn't gone far before he heard a growling voice cry out: 'Hold on there a moment, Uncle Wiggily!' 'Why?' asked the rabbit. 'Because I want to see what you've got,' was the answer. 'Ah, I see ice cream cones!' and with that a great, big, black bear jumped out of the bushes, and stood right in front of Uncle Wiggily. 'Let me pass!' cried the rabbit, holding the ice cream cones so that the bear couldn't get them. 'Indeed I will not!' cried the furry creature. 'Ice cream cones, indeed! If there is one thing that I'm fonder of than another, ice cream cones is it! Let me taste one!' Then before the rabbit could do anything, that bad bear took one ice cream cone right away from him. And that bear did more than that, so he did. He stuck his long, red tongue down inside the cone, and he licked out every bit of cream, with one, long lick. 'My but that's good!' he cried, smacking his lips. 'I guess I'll try the second one,' he said, and he dropped the empty cone, not eating it, mind you, and he took the other full cone away from poor Uncle Wiggily before the rabbit gentleman could stand on his head, or even wave his short tail. 'Oh, don't eat that cone. It belongs to Grandfather Goosey,' cried the rabbit, sadly-like. 'Too late!' cried the bear, in a growlery voice. 'Here it goes!' and with that he stuck his long, red tongue down inside the second cone, and with one lick he licked all the ice cream out and threw the empty cone on the ground. 'Now I feel good and hungry, and I guess I'll eat you,' cried the bear. He made a grab for the poor gentleman rabbit, and folded him tight in his paws. But before that Uncle Wiggily had reached down and had picked up the two empty ice cream cones. 'Oh, let me go!' cried Uncle Wiggily to the bear. 'Indeed I'll not!' shouted the savage creature. 'I want you for supper.' Well, he was just going to eat Uncle Wiggily up, when that brave rabbit just took the sharp points of those two empty ice cream cones, and he stuck them in the bear's ticklish ribs, and Uncle Wiggily tickled the bear so that the furry, savage creature sneezed out loud, and laughed so hard that Uncle Wiggily easily slipped out of his paws, and hopped away before he could be caught again. So that's how the rabbit got safely away, and the empty ice cream cones were of some use after all. But Uncle Wiggily wondered how he could get a full one for Grandfather Goosey Gander, and how he did I'll tell you pretty soon, when, in case a butterfly doesn't bite a hole in my straw hat, the next story will be about Uncle Wiggily and the red ants. STORY XXVII UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE RED ANTS When Uncle Wiggily got to where Grandfather Goosey Gander was waiting for him, under the shady tree, the old gentleman duck jumped up and cried out: 'Oh, how glad I am to see you! I've just been wishing you would hurry back with those ice cream cones. My! I never knew the weather to be so warm at this time of the year. Oh, won't they taste most delicious, those cones!' You see he didn't yet know what the bear had done, eaten all the ice cream out of the cones, as I told you in the other story. 'Oh, dear!' cried the rabbit. 'How sorry I am to have to disappoint you, Grandfather, but there is no ice cream!' 'No ice cream!' cried the alligator, oh, dear me! I mean the duck. 'No ice cream?' 'Not a bit,' said Uncle Wiggily, and then he told about what the savage bear-creature had done, and also how he had used the cones to tickle him. 'Well, that's too bad,' said Grandfather Goosey, 'but here, I'll give you money to buy more cones with,' and he put his hand in his pocket, but lo and behold! he had lost all his money. 'Never mind, perhaps  I  have some pennies,' said the rabbit; so he looked, but, oh, dear me, suz-dud and the mustard pot! All of Uncle Wiggily's money was gone, too. 'Well, I guess we can't get any ice cream cones this week,' said the old gentleman duck. 'We'll have to drink water.' 'Oh, no you won't,' said a buzzing voice. 'I'll get you each an ice cream cone, because you have always been so kind, both of you.' And with that out from the bushes flew a big, sweet, honey bee, with a load of honey. 'Have you got any ice cream cones, Mr. Bee?' asked the rabbit. 'No, but I have sweet honey, and if I go down to the ice cream cone store, and give the man some of my honey he'll give me three cones, and there'll be one for you and one for me and, , ' 'One for Sister Sallie!' interrupted Grandfather Goosey. 'I wish she was here now.' 'She could have a cone if she was here,' said the honey bee, 'as I could get four. But, as long as she is not, the extra cone will go to you, Grandpa. Now, come on, and I'll take my honey to the ice-cream-cone-man.' So they went with him and on the way the bee sung a funny little song like this:     'I buzz, buzz, buzz       All day long.     I make my honey       Good and strong.     I fly about       To every flower     And sometimes stay       'Most half an hour.' Uncle Wiggily didn't know whether or not the bee was really in earnest about what he said, but, surely enough, when they got to the ice cream store, the man took the bee's honey, and handed out four ice cream cones, each larger than the first ones. Two were for the duck as he was so fond of them. 'Oh, let's eat them here, so that if the bear meets us he can't take them away,' suggested Grandfather Goosey, and they did. Then the bee flew home to his hive, and Uncle Wiggily and the old gentleman duck found a nice place to sleep under a haystack. In the morning Grandfather Goosey said he thought he had better go back home, as he had traveled enough. He wanted the rabbit to come with him, but Uncle Wiggily said: 'No, I have not yet found my fortune, and until I do I will keep on traveling.' So he kept on, and the duck went home. Well, it was about two days after that when, along toward evening, as Uncle Wiggily was walking down the road, he saw a real big house standing beside a lake. Oh, it was a very big house, about as big as a mountain, and the chimney on it was so tall as almost to reach the sky. 'Hum! I wonder who lives there?' said Uncle Wiggily. 'Perhaps I can find my fortune in that house.' 'Oh, no; never go there!' cried a voice down on the ground, and, looking toward his toes, Uncle Wiggily saw a little red ant. 'Ah, ha! Why shouldn't I go up to the big house, little red ant?' asked the rabbit. 'Because a monstrous giant lives there,' was the answer, 'and he could eat you up at one mouthful. So stay away.' 'I guess I will,' said the rabbit. 'But I wonder where I can sleep to-night. I guess I'll go, , ' 'Oh, look out! Look out!' cried another red ant. 'There is the giant coming now.' Uncle Wiggily looked, and he saw something like a big tree moving, and that was the giant. Then he felt the ground trembling as if a railroad train was rumbling past, and he heard a noise like thunder, and that was the giant walking and speaking: 'I smell rabbits! I smell rabbits!' cried the giant. 'I must have them for supper!' Then he came on straight to where Uncle Wiggily was, but he hadn't yet seen him. 'Oh, what shall I do? What shall I do?' cried the bunny. 'Let me hide behind that stone.' He made a jump for a rock, taking his valise and crutch with him, but the first red ant said: 'It is no good hiding there, Uncle Wiggily, for the giant can see you.' 'Oh, what shall I do?' he asked again, trembling with fear. 'I know!' cried the second little red ant. 'Let's all bring grains of sand, and cover Uncle Wiggily up, leaving just a little hole for his nose, so he can breathe. Then the giant won't see him. It will be like down at the seashore, when they cover people on the beach up with the sand.' 'Oh, it will take many grains of sand to cover the rabbit,' said the first red ant, but still they were not discouraged. The first two ants called their brothers and sisters, and aunts, and uncles, and papas, and mammas, and cousins, and nephews, and forty-second granduncles. Soon there were twenty-two million four hundred and sixty-seven thousand, eight hundred and ninety-one ants, and a little baby ant, who counted as a half a one, and he carried baby grains of dirt. Then each big ant took up a grain of sand, and then they all hurried up, and put them on Uncle Wiggily, who stretched out in the grass. Now all those ants together could carry lots of sand, you see, and soon the rabbit was completely buried from sight, all but the tip of his nose, so he could breathe, and when the giant came rumbling, stumbling by, he couldn't see the bunny, and so he didn't eat him. And, of course, the giant didn't eat the ants, either for he didn't like them. 'Hum! I thought I smelled a rabbit, but I guess I was mistaken,' said the giant, grumbling and growling, as he tramped around. And that's how Uncle Wiggily was saved, and pretty soon, if there isn't any sand in my rice pudding, I'll tell you about Uncle Wiggily and the bad giant. STORY XXVIII UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BAD GIANT Do you remember about the giant, of whom I told you a little while ago, and how he couldn't find Uncle Wiggily, because the rabbit was covered with sand that the ants carried? Yes, I guess you do remember. Well, now I'm going to tell you what that giant did. At first he was real surprised, because he couldn't find the bunny-rabbit, and he tramped around, making the ground shake with his heavy steps, and growling in his rumbling voice until you would have thought that it was thundering. 'My, my!' growled the giant. 'To think that I can't have a rabbit supper after all. Oh, I'm so hungry that I could eat fourteen thousand, seven hundred and eighty-seven rabbits, and part of another one. But I guess I'll have to take a barrel of milk and a wagon load of crackers for my supper.' So that's what he did, and my how much he ate! Well, after the giant had gone away, Uncle Wiggily crawled out from under the sand, and he said to the ants: 'I guess I'd better not stay around here, for it is too dangerous. I'll never find my fortune here, and if that giant were to see me he'd step on me, and make me as flat as a sheet of paper. I'm going.' 'But wait,' said the biggest ant of all. 'You know there are two giants around here. One is a good one, and one is bad. Now if you go to the good giant I'm sure he will help you find your fortune.' 'I'll try it,' said the rabbit. 'Where does the good giant live?' 'Just up the hill, in that house where you see the flag,' said the big ant, as she ate two crumbs of bread and jam. 'That's where the good giant lives. You must go where you see the fluttering flag, and you may find your fortune.' 'I will,' said Uncle Wiggily, 'I'll go in the morning, the first thing after breakfast.' So the next morning he started off. But in the night something had happened and the rabbit didn't know a thing about it. After dark the bad giant got up, and he went over, and took the flag from the pole in front of the house of the good giant, and hoisted it up over his own house. 'I haven't any flag of my own,' said the bad giant, 'so I will take his.' For you see, the two giants lived not far apart. In fact they were neighbors, but they were very different, one from the other, for one was kind and the other was cruel. So it happened, that when Uncle Wiggily started to go to the giant's house he looked for the fluttering flag, and when he saw it on the bad giant's house he didn't know any better, but he thought it was the home of the good giant. Well, the old gentleman rabbit walked on and on, having said good-by to the ants, and pretty soon he was right close to the bad giant's house. But, all the while, he thought it was the good giant's place, so don't forget that. 'I wonder what sort of a fortune he'll give me,' thought the rabbit. 'I hope I soon get rich, so I can stop traveling, for I am tired.' Well, as he came near the place where the bad giant lived he heard a voice singing. And the song, which was sung in a deep, gruff, grumbling, growling voice, went something like this:     'Oh, bing bang, bung!     Look out of the way for me.       For I'm so mad,       I feel so bad,     I could eat a hickory tree!     Oh, snip, snap, snoop!     Get off my big front stoop,       Or I'll tear my hair       In wild despair,     And burn you with hot soup!' 'My, that's a queer song for a good giant to sing,' thought Uncle Wiggily. 'But perhaps he just sings that for fun. I'm sure I'll find him a jolly enough fellow, when I get to know him.' Well, he went on a little farther, and pretty soon he came to the gate of the castle where the bad giant lived. The rabbit looked about, and saw no one there, so he kept right on, until, all of a sudden, he felt as if a big balloon had swooped down out of the sky, and had lifted him up. Higher and higher he went, until he found himself away up toward the roof of the castle, and then he looked and he saw two big fingers, about as big as a trolley car, holding him just as you would hold a bug. 'Oh, who has me?' cried Uncle Wiggily, very much frightened. 'Let me go, please. Who are you?' 'I am the bad giant,' was the answer, 'and if I let you go now you'd fall to the ground and be killed. So I'll hold on to you.' 'Are you the bad giant?' asked the rabbit. 'Why, I thought I was coming to the good giant's house. Oh, please let me go!' 'No, I'm going to keep you,' said the giant. 'I just took the good giant's flag to fool you. Now, let me see, I think I'll just sprinkle sugar on you and eat you all up, no, I'll use salt, no, I think pepper would be better; I feel like pepper to-day.' So the bad giant started toward the cupboard to get the pepper caster, and poor Uncle Wiggily thought it was all up with him. 'Oh, I wish I'd never thought of coming to see any giant, good or bad,' the rabbit gentleman said. 'Now good-by to all my friends!' 'Hum! Let me see,' spoke the bad giant, standing still. 'Pepper, no, I think I'll put some mustard on you, no, I'll try ketchup, no, I mean horseradish. Oh, dear, I can't seem to make up my mind what to flavor you with,' and he held Uncle Wiggily there in his fingers, away up about a hundred feet high in the air, and wondered what he'd do with the old gentleman rabbit. And it's a good thing he didn't eat him right away, for that was the means of saving Uncle Wiggily's life. Right after breakfast the good giant found out that his bad neighbor had taken his flag, so he went and told the ants all about it. 'Oh, then Uncle Wiggily must have been mixed up about the flag, and he has gone to the wrong place, and he'll be eaten,' said the big ant. 'We must save him. Come on, everybody!' So all the ants hurried along together, and crawled to the castle of the bad giant, and they got there just as he was putting some molasses on Uncle Wiggily to eat him. And those ants crawled all over the giant, on his legs and arms, and nose and ears and toes, and they tickled him so that he squiggled and wiggled and squirreled and whirled, and finally he let Uncle Wiggily fall on a feather bed, not hurting him a bit, and the rabbit gentleman hopped safely away and the ants crawled with him far from the castle of the bad giant. So Uncle Wiggily was saved by the ants, and in case the trolley car doesn't run over my stick of peppermint candy, and make it look like a lolly-pop, I'll tell you soon about Uncle Wiggily and the good giant. STORY XXIX UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE GOOD GIANT Now what do you s'pose that bad giant had for supper the night after the ants helped Uncle Wiggily get away? You'd never guess, so I'll tell you. It was beans, just baked beans, and that giant was so disappointed, and altogether so cut-up about not having rabbit stew, that he ate so many beans, that I'm almost afraid to tell you just how many. But if all the boys in your school were to take their bean shooters, and shoot beans out of a bag for a million years, and Fourth of July also, that giant could eat all of them, and more too, that is, if he could get the beans after the boys shot them away. 'Well, I certainly must be more careful after this,' said Uncle Wiggily to the ants, as they crawled along down the hill with him, when he hopped away from the bad giant's house. 'Oh, it wasn't your fault,' said the second size big red ant, with black and yellow stripes on his stockings. 'That bad giant changed the flags, and that's what fooled you. But I guess the good giant will have his flag back by to-morrow, and then you can go to the right house. We'll go along and show you, and you may get your fortune from him.' So, surely enough, the next day, the good giant went over and took his flag away from the bad giant, and put it upon his own house. 'Now you'll be all right,' said the pink ant, with purple spots on his necktie. 'You won't make any mistake now, Uncle Wiggily. I'm sure the good giant will give you a good fortune.' 'Yes, and he'll give you lots to eat,' said the black ant with white rings around his nose. Well, Uncle Wiggily took his valise and his crutch and up toward the good giant's house he went, with the ants crawling along in the sand to show him the way. Pretty soon they came to a big bridge, over a stream of water, and this was the beginning of the place where the good giant lived. 'We'll all have to go back now,' said the purple ant, with the green patchwork squares on his checks. 'If we crossed over the bridge we might fall off and be drowned. We'll go back, but you go ahead, and we wish you good luck, Uncle Wiggily.' 'Indeed we do,' said a white ant with gold buckles on her shoes. Well, after a little while Uncle Wiggily found himself right inside the good giant's house. And oh! what a big place it was. Why, even the door mat was so big that it took the rabbit three hops to get to the top of it. And that front door! I wish you could have seen it! It was as large as one of your whole houses, and it was only a door, mind you. 'Hello! hello!' cried Uncle Wiggily, as he pounded with his crutch on the floor. 'Is any one at home?' 'But no one answered, and there wasn't a sound except the ticking of the clock, and that made as much noise as a railroad train going over a bridge, for the clock was a big as a church steeple. 'Hum! No one is home,' said Uncle Wiggily. 'I'll just sit down and make myself comfortable.' So he sat down on the floor by the table that was away over his head, and waited for the giant to come back. And, all of a sudden, the rabbit heard a noise like a steam engine going, and he was quite surprised, until he happened to look up, and there stood a pussy cat as big as a cow, and the cat was purring, which made the noise like a steam engine. 'My, if that's the size of the cat, what must the giant be,' thought the rabbit. 'I do hope he's good-natured when he comes home.' Well, pretty soon, in a little while, as Uncle Wiggily was sitting there, listening to the big cat purr, he felt sleepy, and he was just going to sleep, when he heard a gentle voice singing:     'Oh, see the blackbird, sitting in the tree,     Hear him singing, jolly as can be.     Now he'll whistle a pretty little tune,     Isn't it delicious in the month of June?     'Hear the bees a-buzzing, hour by hour,     Gathering the honey from every little flower.     The katydid is singing by his own front door,     Now I'll have to stop this song, I don't know any more.' 'Well, whoever that is, he's a jolly chap,' said the rabbit, and with that who should come in but the giant himself. 'Ho! Ho! Whom have we here?' the giant asked, looking at Uncle Wiggily. 'What do you want, my little furry friend with the long ears? You must be able to hear very well with them.' 'I can hear pretty well,' said the rabbit. 'But I came to seek my fortune.' 'Fine,' cried the good giant, for he it was. 'I'll do all I can for you,' and he laughed so long and hard that part of the ceiling and the gas chandelier fell down, but the giant caught them in his strong hands, and not even the pussy cat was hurt. Then the giant sung another song, like the first, only different, and he fixed the broken ceiling, and said: 'Now for something to eat! Then we'll talk about your fortune. I'll get you some carrots.' So he went out, and pretty soon he came back, carrying ten barrels of carrots in one hand and seventeen bushels of cabbage in the other. 'Here's a little light lunch for you,' he said to Uncle Wiggily. 'Eat this, and I'll get you some more, when we have a regular meal.' 'Oh, why this is more than I could eat in a year,' said the rabbit, 'but I thank you very much,' so he nibbled at one carrot, while the good giant ate fifteen thousand seven hundred and eight loaves of bread, and two million bushels of jam. Then he felt better. 'So you want to find your fortune, eh?' the giant said to the rabbit. 'Well, now I'll help you all I can. How would you like to stay here and work for me? You have good ears, and you could listen for burglars in the night when I am asleep. Will you?' 'I think I will,' said Uncle Wiggily. And he was just reaching for another carrot, when suddenly from outside sounded a terrible racket. 'Where is he? Let me get at him! I want him right away, that rabbit I mean!' cried a voice, and Uncle Wiggily jumped up in great fright, and looked for some place to hide. The giant jumped up, too, and grabbed his big club. But don't be alarmed. Nothing bad is going to happen to our Uncle Wiggily, in fact he is going to have lots of fun soon. So if my motorboat doesn't turn upside down and spill out the pink lemonade, I'll tell you in the next story about Uncle Wiggily and the giant's little boy. STORY XXX UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE GIANT'S BOY Let me see, I believe I left off where Uncle Wiggily was in the house of the good giant, and the old gentleman rabbit heard a terrible noise. Didn't I? 'My goodness!' exclaimed the rabbit, jumping up so quickly that he upset one of the giant's toothpicks, on which he had been sitting for a chair, for the giant's toothpicks were as large as a big chestnut tree. 'My goodness!' cried Uncle Wiggily, 'what in the world is that?' 'I guess it's my little boy coming home from school,' said the good giant as softly as he could, but, even then, his voice was like thunder. 'He must have heard that you were here.' 'Will he hurt me? Does he love animals?' asked the rabbit, for he was getting frightened. 'Will your little boy be kind to me?' 'Oh, indeed he will!' cried the good giant. 'I have taught him to love animals, for you know he is so big and strong, even though I do call him my  little  boy, that it would be no trouble for him to take a bear or a lion, and squeeze him in one hand so that the bear or lion would never hurt any one any more. But, just because he is big and strong, though not so big and strong as I am, I have taught my boy to be kind to the little animals.' 'Then I will have no fear,' said Uncle Wiggily, winking his nose, I mean his eyes, and just then the door of the giant's house opened and in came his little boy. Well, at first Uncle Wiggily was so frightened that he did not know what to do. I wonder what you would say if you were suddenly to see a boy almost as big as your house, or mine, walk into the parlor, and sit down at the piano? Well, that's what the old gentleman rabbit saw. 'Ah, my little boy is home from school,' said the giant, kindly. 'Did you have your lessons, my son?' 'Yes, father, I did,' was the answer. 'And I learned a new song. I'll sing it for you.' So he began to play the piano with his little finger nail, and still, and with all that, he made as much noise as a circus band of music can make on a hot day in the tent. Oh, he played terribly loud, the giant's boy did, and Uncle Wiggily had to put his paws over his ears, or he might have been made deaf. Then the giant's little boy sang, and even when he hummed it the noise was like a thunder storm, only different. Now, this is the boy giant's song, and you will have to sing it with all your might, as hard as you can, but not if the baby is asleep.     'I am a little fellow,       But soon I will grow big.     And then I'll sit beside the sea,       And in the white sand dig.     'I'll make a hole so very deep,       To China it will go.     And then I'll fill it up with shells       Wherein the wild waves blow.' And with that the giant's little boy banged so hard on the piano with his little finger nail that he broke a string, and made a funny sound, like a banjo out of tune. 'Oh, I didn't mean to do that!' the giant's boy cried. 'I'm sorry!' 'Dear me! I wonder when you'll grow up?' asked the giant, sort of sad-like. 'I think he's pretty big now,' said Uncle Wiggily. And, indeed, the boy-giant was so tall that when the rabbit stood up as high as he could stand, he only came up to the tip end of the shoe laces on the giant boy's big shoes. 'Oh, he grows very slowly,' said the giant, and then the boy noticed the rabbit for the first time. Well, that boy-giant wanted to know all about Uncle Wiggily, where he came from and where he was going, and all that, and Uncle Wiggily told about how he was traveling around to seek his fortune. 'Oh, I believe I know where you can find lots of money, Uncle Wiggily,' said the giant's boy kindly, as he reached over and stroked the rabbit's ears. 'I have always heard that there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. The next time we see one, you and I will go out and search for the money. Then you will have your fortune, and you won't have to travel around any more.' 'That will be fine!' cried the rabbit, 'for, to tell you the truth, I am getting pretty tired of going about the country. Still, I will not give up until I find my fortune.' 'All right. But we will have to wait until it rains, and then we'll see where the end of the rainbow is,' said the giant's boy. 'Now we will have some games together. Let's play tag.' Well, they started to play that, but, land's sake, flopsy dub and a basket of ice cream cones! Uncle Wiggily ran here, and there, and everywhere, and he jumped and leaped about so that the giant's little boy couldn't catch him, for the big-little fellow wasn't very spry on his feet. 'Oh, I guess we had better not play that game any more,' said the boy giant, as he accidentally nearly stepped on Uncle Wiggily's left ear. 'I might hurt you. Let's play hide-and-go-seek.' But Uncle Wiggily was even better at this game than he had been at tag, for he could hide in such small holes that the boy giant couldn't even see them, so of course that wouldn't do for a game. It was no fun. Then all at once it began to rain. My! how it did pour! It rained snips and snails and puppy dogs' tails, with the puppies fast to the tails, of course, and the streets were covered with them. Then it rained a few ice cream cones, and Uncle Wiggily and the giant boy had all they wanted to eat, the giant eating fourteen thousand seven hundred and eighty-six, and part of another one, while Uncle Wiggily had only two cones. 'Oh, there is the rainbow!' cried the boy giant at last, as he saw the beautiful gold and green and orange and red colors in the sky. 'Now for the pot of gold.' So he and Uncle Wiggily started off together to find it. But they had not gone very far through the woods before they met the papa giant. 'Where are you going?' he asked of them. 'To the end of the rainbow to get the pot of gold,' said the giant's little boy. 'You don't need to,' said the giant, 'for there is none there. That is only a fairy story. Wait, I'll show you.' So he stretched out his long arm as far as it would go and he reached away down to the end of the rainbow and he felt all around with his long fingers, and sure enough, there wasn't a bit of gold there, for his hand came back empty. 'It's too bad,' said the giant's little boy to Uncle Wiggily. 'There is nothing there for you. But perhaps you will find your fortune to-morrow. Come and stay with me until morning.' So Uncle Wiggily went back to the giant's house, and the next day quite a surprising adventure occurred to him, and in case the gasoline in my motorboat doesn't wash all the paint off my red necktie I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and Grand-daddy Longlegs. STORY XXXI UNCLE WIGGILY AND DADDY LONGLEGS Uncle Wiggily got up early the morning after the good giant had shown him that there wasn't any gold at the end of the rainbow. The old gentleman rabbit looked where a place had been set for him at the table, but alas and alack a-day, the table was almost as high from the floor as the church steeple is from the ground, and Uncle Wiggily could not reach up to it. 'Hum, let's see what we will do,' spoke the papa giant. 'I know, I'll get a spool of thread from the lady giant next door, and that will answer for a table for you, Uncle Wiggily, and you can use another toothpick for a chair.' So while the boy giant went for the spool of thread, the papa giant served Uncle Wiggily's breakfast. First he brought in a washtub full of milk and a bushel basket full of oatmeal. 'What is that for?' asked the rabbit in surprise. 'That is for your breakfast,' was the answer. 'Isn't it enough? Because I can get you more in a jiffy, if you want it.' 'Oh, it is entirely too much,' said Uncle Wiggily. 'I can only take a little of that oatmeal.' 'Very well, then, I will take this myself, and get you a small dish full,' spoke the papa giant, and he ate all that oatmeal and milk up at one mouthful, but even then it was hardly enough to fill his hollow tooth. Then the boy giant came back with the spool, which was as big as the dining-room table in a rabbit's house. Up at this new table the traveling uncle sat, and he ate a very good breakfast indeed. 'Now I must start off again to seek my fortune,' he said, as he took his crutch, striped red, green and yellow, like a cow's horn. Oh, excuse me! I was thinking of circus balloons, I guess. Anyhow Uncle Wiggily took his crutch and valise, and, as he was about to start off, the boy giant said: 'I will walk along a short distance with you, and in case any bad animals try to hurt you I'll drive them away.' 'Oh, I don't believe any one will harm me,' spoke the rabbit, but nevertheless something did happen to him. As he and the boy giant were walking along, all of a sudden there was a noise from behind a big, black stump, and out jumped a big, black bear. He rushed right at the rabbit, and called out: 'Ha! Now I have you! I've been waiting a long while for you, and I thought you'd never come. But, better late than never. Now for my dinner! I've had the fire made for some time to cook you, and the kettle is boiling for tea.' He was just going to grab our Uncle Wiggily, when the giant's little boy called out: 'Here, you let that rabbit alone! He's a friend of mine!' But, listen to this, the bear never thought a thing about a boy giant being with Uncle Wiggily, and he never even looked up at him. Only when the bear heard the giant's boy speaking he thought it was distant thunder, and he said: 'Oh, I must hurry home with that rabbit before it rains. I don't like to get wet!' 'Yes, I guess you  will  hurry home!' cried the giant's boy, and with that he reached over, and he grabbed that black, ugly bear by his short, stumpy tail and he flung him away over the tree tops, like a skyrocket, and it was some time before that bear came down. And when he did, he didn't feel like bothering Uncle Wiggily any more. 'Now I guess you'll be all right for a while on your travels,' said the boy giant as he called good-by to the old gentleman rabbit. 'Send me a souvenir postal when you find your fortune, and if any bad animals bother you, just telephone for me, and I'll come and serve them as I did the bear.' Then the old gentleman rabbit thanked the boy giant, and started off again. He traveled on and on, over hills and down in little valleys, and across brooks that flowed over green mossy stones in the meadow, and pretty soon Uncle Wiggily came to a big gray stone in the middle of a field. And, as he looked at the stone, the old gentleman rabbit saw something red fluttering behind it, and he heard a noise like some one crying. 'Ha! Here is where I must be careful!' exclaimed the rabbit to himself. 'Perhaps that is a red fox behind the stone, and he is making believe cry, so as to bring me up close, and then he'll jump out and grab me. No indeed, I'm going to run back.' Well, Uncle Wiggily was just going to run back, when he happened to look again, and there, instead of a fox behind the stone, it was a little boy, with red trousers on, and he was crying as hard as he could cry, that boy was. 'What is the matter, my little chap?' asked the rabbit kindly. 'Are you crying because you have on red trousers instead of blue? I think red is a lovely color myself. I wish I had red ears, as well as red eyes.' 'Oh, I am not crying for that,' said the little boy, wiping away his tears on a big green leaf, 'but you see I am like Bo-peep, only I have lost my cows, instead of my sheep, and I don't know where to find them.' 'Oh, I'll help you look,' said Uncle Wiggily. 'I am pretty good at finding lost cows. Come, we'll hunt farther.' So off they started together, Uncle Wiggily holding the little boy by one of his paws, one of the rabbit's paws, I mean. Well, they looked and looked, but they couldn't seem to find those cows. They looked at one hill, and on top of another hill, and down in the hollows, and under the trees by the brook, but no cows were to be seen. 'Oh, dear!' cried the little boy, 'if I don't find them soon there'll be no milk for dinner.' 'And I am very thirsty, too,' said the rabbit. 'I wish I had a drink of milk. But where in the world can those cows be?' and he looked up into the sky, not because he thought the cows were there, but so that he might think better. Then he looked down at the ground, and, as he did so he saw a little red creature with eight long legs, and the creature wiggled one leg at the rabbit friendly-like as if to shake hands. 'Why don't you ask me where the cows are?' said the long-legged insect. 'Why, can you tell?' inquired Uncle Wiggily. 'Of course I can. I'm a grand-daddy longlegs, and I can always tell where the cows are,' was the reply. 'Just you ask me.' So Uncle Wiggily and the little boy, both together, politely asked where they could find the cows, and the grand-daddy just pointed with one long leg off toward the woods where the rabbit and boy hadn't thought of looking before that. 'You'll find your cows there,' said grand-daddy longlegs, and then he hurried home to his dinner. And Uncle Wiggily and the boy went over to the woods, and there in the shade by a brook, sure enough were the cows, chewing their gum, I mean their cuds. And they were just waiting to be driven home. So Uncle Wiggily, and the boy with the red trousers, drove the cows home, and they were milked, and the old gentleman rabbit had several glasses full, glasses full of milk, not cows, you know. Goodness me! A cow couldn't get into a glass could it? I guess not! And after that Uncle Wiggily, ,  Well, but see here now. I think I've put enough adventures about Uncle Wiggily in this book, and I must save some for another one. So I think I will call the following book 'Uncle Wiggily's Travels,' for he still kept on traveling after his fortune you know. And he found it, too, which is the best part of it. Oh, my yes! He found his fortune all right. Don't worry about that. And in the next book, the very first thing he did, was to have an adventure with a red squirrel-girl, who was some relation to Johnnie and Billie Bushytail. So that's all there is to Uncle Wiggily, for a little while, if you please, but if you want to hear anything else about him I'll try, later on, to tell you some more stories. And now, dear children, good-bye. THE END. \""
